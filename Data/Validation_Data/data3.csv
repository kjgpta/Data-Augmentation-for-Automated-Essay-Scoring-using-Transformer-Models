3,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in one big way, the time. The time greatly affects the speaker in many ways. For example, the time the cycleist gets to the first town, it has been abandoned for years. Second, the water spout didn’t work when he got to the cabin. Lastly, the @CAPS1 juice factory was abandoned when he found it on his lost journey. As you can see, time affected the cycleist greatly.  ",1.0,3.0
3,"There are many features in the story’s setting that affects the cyclist. One of them is when he had ran out of water and he had nothing left because of the hot air. Then as he was riding along he saw a sign that said “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit,” so then not only did he have to ride on this bumpy road, but he had to go even slower.

He describes his encounter with the snake by saying ""As sane point,tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously drop snote - it really did look life a determinol book-blocked the majority of the pavement in trony at me, The author uses effective word choices such as ""rediculously longe and I could drop from heatstroke"" to convey is almost hopeless mood. His encounter with the snake makes you pity him because he has had so many bad things happen to him. When he says tha he is worried about dying of heatstroke, you begin to worry about him. The author's portral of the bare, desclore landscape is an excellent way to set up a hopeless, certain mood.",3.0,10.0
3,"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.”, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example, in the text it states ‘I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.” @CAPS1 is a reasonable setting to make the cyclist relatively parched. It also says “over one long, crippling hill” @CAPS1 shows that much effort was required to get over the hill. This effort takes it’s  tell when the author states “I wiped the sweat from my eyes” and “I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean”. Obviously the setting’s features must affect the cyclist.",2.0,7.0

Before he knew this , he had been “ hitting the water bottles pretty regularly” . as he traveled for a bit he noticed that the “ flat road was replaced by short rolling hill.” He then, due to lack of water, enter a “dehydrated state.” The” rolling hills” affected the cyclist because they are physically harder to overcome then flat land.

3,"The feature of the setting affected the cyclist by not turning down the information from the well aged men. He shouldn’t have taken the information because the men haven’t left their porch for a long time and most likely didn’t keep up with the up to date cycling routes. Instead of taking the advise form the men he should have thanked them for trying to help, but listen to his conscience. Like he said,” they’d sounded so sure of themselves  when pointing and landmarks and spounting off towns l would come to along  this breezy jaunt .” it’s hard to turn down information when it seem’s so hard but sometimes you just have to do things yourself.

One of the main factors of this trip was the heat, I knew this when it said, “and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke” @CAPS1 factor was water because, “The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.” Hills @CAPS2 played a part of the setting when it said, “over one long, crippling hill.” @CAPS2 the cyclist had no where to stop which was a big factor, “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.” These are all of the factors that I thought the setting brought into affect.",2.0,7.0
3,"The features in the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. Even though the cyclist didn’t show a sign of giving up on the tough hills, snakes, bad road condition, and most of all lack of water, the cyclist still showed confidence and determination. Without the obstacles in the cyclist’s way, there wouldn’t be need for “hard”, “concrete” determination to move on",2.0,7.0
3,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by acting as obstacle. For example, the man was “traveling through the high deserts of California in June,” running low on his water supply. Another obstacle was the bumpy road the man hit, acting to harden his time on the bicycle.

3,"The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” affect the cyclist in a few ways. First, there are rolling hills towards the end. It would be hard to get up the hills when you’re really tired. Also, there were no buildings to relieve him of his thirst. The story says “only a few tantalizing sips” were left in his bottle. He didn’t have much so he sucked on pebbles. Finally, the setting is in the high deserts, of California in june. The temperature would have been really hot then so he needed to stay hydrated.

3,The features of the setting did affect the cyclist. It seemed like as he rode it was the setting he looked at to keep him occupied. Then it was used more as a distraction when he ran out of water. He also used the setting as a guide to look for the park. At one point he was noticing something on ground that he thought was a large snake. It was one of the points where he was seeing things and running out of water. He has also describing the setting when he found the building. This was when he tried using pebbles to forget about his thirst. All during this the setting was his main thing as he was looking for the park.

When he finally reached the bait place he drank a lot of water and was satisfied.  ",2.0,7.0
3,"The setting of the story causes many problems for the cyclist. For example, he asks some elderly men for directions and it takes him even longer then he had planned. Then he runs out of water and it is extremely hot outside. He finds a rusty pipe but it does not work. The hot temperatures cause him to get very weak. Then the flat road he is riding on started forming which made it difficult for him to ride his bike. The cyclist had a very difficult time making it to Yosemite.",2.0,7.0
3,"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasn’t well prepared for it. He expected more stops with more water, not cycling through ghost towns on a desert-like path. He uses the quote “breezy jaunt” which means he expected an easy ride. He got what he described as “one long crippling hill” meaning that the trip was indeed harder than he expected. He encountered rough roads and large snakes, not the towns and water he was expecting. They all cause him to become dehydrated lost and tired.

Therefore the situations the author had to go through were very difficult.",1.0,3.0
3,Some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist would be have the dry ground was. Another one would be the condition that the roads were in and the last one would be the row hot it was in california. One feature that they really exlabortes would be how dry the ground was. It was so dry that you could probably cook an egg on the ground. Everything there looked like it was fine to die. One thing that was said in the essay was the “rolling hills were like any runways”. Another feature the cyclist should looked was now the condition of the roads were. They were so  dry that they looked like dry land that would just break into poecies.” The roads were hot in good shape it wasn’t even a raq it was a dry dirt pathtrat he was riding on.

He sure did pay for it though. The cyclist had to go miles with little or no water, over hills when he could had been there by now. Next time the good thing to do would the cyclist follow his an instinct and used his good map he has. When he had to go to the @CAPS1 place and he had to pump the water and nothing good come out and he had to travel more out of the way to get refreshing water.”…time “over one ring, crippling hill a building came into new.” The traveled to hard and long and what he thought was an adventure until he found nothing from what the old men led him to.

3,"It affects him greatly. I think he starts to get a little delerious because he sticks rocks in his mouth. I would never do that even if was thirsty. He thought it was going to be a shorter ride but it turned out to be even longer and more challenging. He had had a great out look on it before he left but as the trip went on it got worse and worse he passed a big snake and that make him scared. I think any one would be scared if a big snake ran across their bike. He even thought he was going crazy. He kept saying he thought he was going to die and he thought he washowing mirages. He was releived when he found this store and was 'proably' the climax of his trip. Like he @CAPS1” I want to find the ownerof this place and kiss him and by bait even though I don’t need any.” He tried to make the best out of the situation and with what he had.

3,"There are many reasons why the setting affected the cyclist. One of these reasons was because of the high temperature. Being a cyclist, he had no protection from the sun, therefore the heat affected him more then they would have if he had been in a car. Another reason would be his lac k of water. Because he was mis-informed about the towns, he quickly ran out of water. And because of the heat he quickly could have become dehydrated And because the “towns” the men who gave him the directions,ended up being ghost towns, he had nowhere to get more water. The last reason would be because of the conditions of the road. It would have been easier if the roads were flat and straight. But they weren’t. They were short and hilly. As you can see, these are three reasons why the setting affected the cyclist.",2.0,7.0
3,"There are many ways the features of the setting affected, the cyclist. One example is the rough roads and hills are hard to go over. I know this because in boy scouts we bike 12 miles on rocky trails. I usually dont bike much so this was a killer for me. Another example of the features affecting the cyclist is the sun. When you go riding you dont always think about the sun. Also in California there it gets very hot in the summer. So the cyclist was drinking water regularly to keep hydrated. I can relate to this because of boy scout camp are fear one scout didn’t drink enough water after being in the sun for many hours, and got heat stroke. So those are just a few examples of how the features of the setting can and will affect cyclists.",2.0,7.0
3,"Many of the features in the setting affected the cyclist. If the story had taken place in a forrest, the cyclist might not have had some of the troubles he did. First, he was riding his bike in the desert. It is very hot in the desert and he had to drink more to try to stay hydrated. Also, the road he was had a lot of hills. It took him more energy to ride up the hills than it would have if he was riding on a flat land. This is how the features of setting affected the cyclist and made his journey more difficult.",2.0,7.0
3,"In the story the cyclist realizes that they made a mistake after riding her bike, in the California desert in June with limited water and got directions from old people. When the cyclist wants to go to Yosemite he gets directions and is determined to get there. However he rides his bike casually drinking his water until there is basically none left. Also the cyclist runs into a huge diamondback snake which could’ve bit him. Then the cyclist thinks that they are getting overheated because of the unbearable weather.

3,"In the essay “Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit” The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. At first the cyclist is confident. He feels the old men he has gotten his advice from are wise in their years. For he is going on a bike trip to Yosemite national park, and their advice, he thought, was about to cut many worthless hours out of that days trip. The first setting the cyclist comes too is a lonely old ghost town, which only beniftis that the old water fountin is still in service. This is houmourous to the cyclist. He now knows the old mens advice is not up to date. Then, to his dismay, he comes to an even more abandoned town, no working water pump. This troubles the cyclist. He is determined to reach his destination but he has a feeling in the back of his mind something will go wrong. Then he sees a snake not only making him scared and dehydration but naw he is afraid of what animals could potentially harm him once he is in his unconscious state after traveling more he sees an old abandoned grape juice factory.

He moved on and there was a sign that said, “Rough Road Ahead,” he had to ride over some hills, he was almost running out of water. He didn’t see any buildings for miles. When he came over a hill he saw a building it was a Welch’s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant, but there was nobody there, so he put some stones in his mouth to suck on.

One that he is dehydrated and all of the places he seeks sanctuary in feeling to be the farthest thing from a haven.

3,"After reading the essay named “Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit”, I have concluded that the setting can affect a cyclist. In the essay, it says that there is a long crippling hill that he went up on his bike and then saw a building. He wiped his sweat from his eyes and tried to make sure that the building was not a mirage. This shows that the setting can affect the cyclist because the biker was sweating after he went up a long hill that was steep. That is very hard to go up. A quote from the text to support this statement is “over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn’t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill “(@NUM1).

And what I think he met by that is that he didn’t know what to do because he has never took advice from anyone on traveling and he wasn’t sure if he had wanted to do it or not so he had to go with whatever he thought was best for him to do.

This was because he had been using his water bottles regularly yet the setting didn’t give him any hope of being able to refill his water bottles. The cyclist begins to feel an even greater feeling of hopelessness when he realizes that “There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure”. This setting makes the cyclist feel sad because he realizes that no one would likely find him/he find them before he gets sick from heatstroke. The one time that the author does feel determination is when he see’s “Gary and Wilber’s Fish Camp”. as soon as the camp come into the setting the cyclist realized he would be okay.

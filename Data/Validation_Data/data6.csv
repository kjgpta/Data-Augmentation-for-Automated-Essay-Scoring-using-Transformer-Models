6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there In order for them to be docked there safely, they had to find a safe way to moore them to the mast, because if not, then it would add stress to the building's frame. They had to transmit the dirigible's load and wind pressure all the way to the building's foundation. They also had to modify and strengthen the building. They also had to be careful with their use of hydrogen, because it's highly flammable.",1.0,2.0
6,the obstacles the builders of Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there Because the dirigibles want to stole the money for build the Empire State Building. that share with the builders of Empire State Building. but the builder of Building. They don't treat on money They not slove the problem they use wrong thing to put on fop of Building.,1.0,2.0
6,There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced for dirigibles to dock there. For example most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Winds made it hard for dirigibles to stay in place. Even if the blimp was tethered to the building winds would blow it to near by building which could pop it. Another reason was there were laws of airships flying to low over urban areas. so dirigibles were illegal to use on the Empire state building or even get close. Dirigibles with all these obstacles were niether safe nor practical.,3.0,8.0
6,"Al Smith and @PERSON1 the builders of the Empire State Building, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Public safety was the main concern. Most airships from other countries used hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is more flamable than helium used in American airships and after the Hindenburg disaster, no one wanted a similar disaster occuring in New York City. Another concern was the shifting wind currents. At @NUM1 feet in altitude, the wind is strong and the docked dirigibles would spin wildly around the mast because using lead weights to weigh the tail down was dangerous. Pedestrians below could easily be hurt if a weight were to fall. A third obstacle was a legal issue. Airships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas. Even though the Empire @CAPS1 Building was the tallest building at the time, it didn't reach a height where it would be safe to fly over city. These obstacles prevented Al Smith and @PERSON1 from ever allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building.",3.0,8.0
6,"The builders of the Empire State Building had their hope and dreams high up, because even though the whole ""Transportation of the Future"" idea was about to be something extremely hard or even impossible. They tried as hard as they could and one of the best thing of the builders' personality was that if they were thinking about the money and the fame they would've done it without thinking on the consequences.      With a thousand-foot dirigible ""parked"" at the top of the building, would obviously add stress all over.         ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.""     One of the reasons of why the builders of @CAPS1.S.B wasn't the facts straight was that they didn't know there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban ares.     Those were one of the obstacles the @CAPS1.S.B faced and the the transportation of the future quietly disappeared.",3.0,8.0
6,"In the piece ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in their attempt in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Three obstacles that faced them were the framework of the building, the type of gas used to make them float, and the wind currents. These were obstacles that made it so that the Empire State Building could ""never fulfill its purpose"".        The first obstacle is the framework of the building, which the piece said would be put under stress by the massive weight of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle for the builders because they wanted to ensure the safety of the people in the building and they did not want the building to collapse. As @CAPS1 points out, this resulted in ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" The second obstacle was the type of gas used to make them float, which was highly flammable. Lüsted pointed out an event that happened in New Jersey where a German dirigible by the name of ""Hindenburg"" was set aflame. This was an obstacle because ""if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" there would be serious damages to the city, as well as many other casualties. The third obstacle was the wind current above the area of the building, which were very violent. As stated in the piece ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"", which was highly dangerous. The fact that a huge ship like that was dangling so high above people ""was neither practical nor safe"", as Lüsted said.     So in the building of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles, three of them being: the framework of the building, the gas used in the ships, and the wind currents. These reasons prevented them from fulfilling Al Smith's dream of an amazing moor mast for dirigibles.",3.0,8.0
6,"The mooring mast was added to the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock there for several hours if they needed to be refuled or to let passengers on and off. But the architects did not realize the obstacle they would face with not only building the mast itself but also allowing the dirigibles to dock. Since a thousand foot dirigible hanging off the top of the building would add stress to the building's frame, the architects would have to come up with an whole new design. After modifying and strengthing the steel frame of the building, the architects would be faced with the obstacle of safety. ""One safety problem was that dirigibles from outside the country used hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders realized if it caught on fire it would destroy the densed population of downtown New York. The biggest obstacle they were faced with was nature itself. Because of the high, violent wind currents at the top of the building, no one could predict what would happen. Thus the mooring mast never acomplished what it was made to do.",3.0,8.0
6,"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, builders of the Empire State Building attempted intense obstacles to achieve their goal. The goal was to take the mooring mast and locate it to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to, ""anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on,"" (par. 6). Some were supportive of the idea and ""the navy even offered its dirigible"", along with the, ""airship transport Company that planned to offer dirigible service across the pacific ocean,"" (par. @NUM1). However, the supportive help was inedequate to overcoming their obstacles because, ""over Sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's frame work, ""(par. @NUM2). Also, the weather became an issue to them achieving their goal. Strong winds would cause, ""the back of the Ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (par. @NUM3). The process of achieving goals is to perserve through difficulties and courageously attempt issues.",3.0,8.0
6,"In The Mooring Mast by  @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles that they faced was that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the roof. If they did so, Stress would be added to the building's frame: ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single Cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). To fix this problem they spent over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications to the building's frame work.Another problem that they countered was that the violent air currents on the top of the building would make the dirigible @CAPS1 too much to land. The mooring mast would never work: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (paragraph @NUM2). A dirigible would never be able to succesfully land.A third problem was that it was unsafe for dirigibles to land on the building. One of the biggest reasons were safety: ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flamable"" (paragraph @NUM3). The idea of landing a dirigible on a building is unsafe. The stress added to the building's frame, violent air currents, and it being unsafe were some of the obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.",4.0,10.0
6,The top of the empire State building cant hold the weight of a blimp because its too narrow. The bottom of the empire state building goes from wide to really narrow so in all there is no possible way for the blimp to land on top of the empire state building without probably breaking the top part of the building.,1.0,2.0
6,"When building a dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building, builders faced multiple problems. First, the buildings foundation wouldn't be able to withstand the pressure of the wind and the dirigible's load. As it says In paragraph @NUM1 ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This ment the builders would have to reenforce the buildings frame for that situation. Another problem was safety reasons, which was the greatest problem. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which was highly flamable. If a dirigible exploted over a densely populated erea, like down town New York, the damage would be massive. The builders biggest obstacle to overcome was nature. Because the mooring mast was up so high, there were always violent winds due to the air currents. It wouldn't be safe to have a giant dirigible dangling over the busy streets of New York. These were the main problems that the builders faced in putting a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building. Also it was illegal for airships to fly that low.",3.0,8.0
6,"The obstacles the men faced when trying to figure out how to dock dirigibles were difficult. There were so many worries and confusions that ran threw the builders minds. The main obstacle the builders faced was, saftey of other citizens. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is very flammable. After the men thought of a theory they were on to the next. Another problem they faced was actually trying to hold down the dirigible and keep it from @CAPS1 the air. The problem with that, is they wanted to hold down with lead weights. which isn't to safe for the people walking the streets below the building. The men were finally convinced that they couldn't moor a dirigible to a building, so the theory of that was gone.",2.0,5.0
6,"THE BUIDERS OF THE MOORING MAST HAD THE OBSTACLE OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDINGS' FRAME. THE ARCHITECTS COULD NOT DROP A MOORING MAST ON TOP OF THE BUILDINGS FLAT ROOF BECAUSE  A THOUSAND-FOOT DIRIGIBLE MOORED AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING HELD BY A SINGLE CABLE WOULD ADD STRESS TO THE BUILDINGS FRAME. SO THE FRAME OF THE BUILDING WOULD HAVE TO BE MODIFIED AND STRENGTHENED. THE GREATEST OBSTACLE WERE THE WINDS ON TOP OF THE BUIDING WERE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING DUE TO  VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS, THE DIRGIBLE WOULD BE SWIVELING AROUND. THE MOORING MAST WOULD NOT BE SAFE.",2.0,5.0
6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All the builders had to start off by making a mooring mast at the top of the building. This was not easy. They had to make sure it was in the right place so that it wouldn't apply to much pressure to the building. They also had to make sure it could stand the wind currents. After all that hard work, Al Smith had a bigger idea.Al Smith wanted to make the mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, a place where dirigibles could anchor for several hours. He also thought that it would be a good place for the dirigles to get fueling if needed and it would be an opportunity for the passengers to get on & off the dirigibles for a break. Unfortunately for Al Smith, the Plan didn't work. One reason why it didn's succeed was because the dirigibles were made of hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Another reason was because the back of ship would swirve around & around the mooring mast. In conclusion, those were some obstacles the builders faced",3.0,8.0
6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced and overlooked numerous issues when it comes to the landing of dirigibles. Perhaps the largest overlooked issue was that there was a law in place stating that the dirigibles could not land that close to the city. Another obstacle was that the hydrogen used to float the dirigibles was highly flamable and would be incredibly dangerous in such an urban populated area. As if these issues were not reason enough for them to realize they're plan would fail, there were many other issues related to the dirigibles, that were not considered. Such as it would be nearly impossible to safely land what is essentially a balloon that close to the many buildings considering the force of the winds. Overall the builders should have seen that they're plan for the dirigibles was entirely unrealistic",3.0,8.0
6,"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacal they came across was safety. As it says in the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The German Hindenburg was destroyed by Fire in New Jersey and it would have been alot worse if it had happend in downtown New York. The Greatest obstacal the builders faced was nature its self. The winds were very violent because they kept shifting, therefor the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mask. Those are few obstacals the builders faced.",2.0,5.0
6,"Dirigibles, or blimps, are very interesting technology, yet dangerous due to their unpredictability. When you pop a balloon, there is no controlling it, and the same could be said of a blimp. They were, ""enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" (pg. @NUM1) the builders of the Empire State building had to keep this in mind. If a piece of sharp metal hits the cotton fabric, a dirigible is going to fall on the heads of many downtown New @CAPS1. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, ""this also changed the perspectives of the lead designers (pg. @NUM2).

6,The obstacles that the builders of The empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are: 1) The empire state Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top to dock the new airships that will accommodate passengers that already existing transatlantic routes; @NUM1) They attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there was The lack of a suitable Landing area; @NUM2) The mooring mast was added at the top of The building so The dirigibles can anchor There for several hours and to let The passengers off and on.,2.0,5.0
6,The builder of the Empire State building had to face many obstacles if they wanted to have dirigibles dock there. One thing they did not do was make a platform for the dirigibles to land on. They would also need equipment people up their to fix the blimp if it ever got messed up or needed feul. Another obstacle would be the money they would have to spend on all the stuff. Back in the 1930's they did not have any where near the kind of technology needed to build stuff like this. Dirigible were very unsafe as well because hydrogen is flammable. On top of the building were vicious winds so that made it harder. There was also a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas.,2.0,5.0
6,"There were many issues the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The idea was destined to fail. These were issues with the safety and of the law.First, dirigibles filled with hydrogen were highly flammable. This could cause a huge problem in a densely populated area like downtown New York. Also, wins on top of the building work constantly shifting because of the air currents. This would make the dirigible hard to stay in place. Lead weights would have to be used to keep the dirigible in place, but the idea was neither safe nor practical. Last, there was a law against airships flying too low over an urban area. The law made it illegal for a dirigible to ever be tied up to the top of the building.Many issues were phased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. Issues with the law and safety would make this idea unsuccessful.",3.0,8.0
6,"There were two major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greater of the two obstacles was nature. The winds at the top of the building were violently shifting due to violent air currents. If a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would shift around the mast. Dirigibles that docked in fields were held down by lead weights, which they couldn't use on the top of the building above pedestrians.The second obstacle was that there was a law that said that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. A dirigible could easily crash into a building and explode like the Hindenburg.",3.0,8.0
6,"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the dirigible's load and wind pressure on the building. It would put stress on the frame of the building. Builders had to come up with another way to make the frame. The architects had to change the design of the mooring mask as well. Based on the excerpt the greatest of the mooring mask was nature. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

6,"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems attempting to build a dock for dirigibles. One major problem was where and how to tie down the ship. The dirigibles could not be tied down directly to the frame of the building. That would put to much stress on the steel frame. Another huge problem was public safety. International dirigibles were filled with hydrogen. Hydrogen is more flamable than helium, helium was used in American dirigibles. They saw what happened to the Hindenburg and knew it would be @NUM1 times worse if it happened over the streets of New York City. The third big problem was the violent air currents. The air currents would violently blow the back end of the dirigibles in circles. This made it unsafe for passengers and workers.

Also, the stress of a dirigible, and the wind pressure would add stress to the frame of the Empire state building. All of this stress would be put onto the building's foundation. To fix this, ""the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". The overall greatest obstacle was nature, something that can't be changed. The violent air currents would cause them to have use lead weights to weigh down the back.

6,"Before the architects and engineers could allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building, they had to consider a few variables. Namely the mooring mast, the wind currents, and the law. The engineers behind the mooring mast realized that they could not simply place a spire atop the building, for the tension on the tether cable would be too great. The architects modified the entire steelframe to account for the massive load of the dirigible. The tension and wind pressure was transmitted down through the building and distributed evenly. When currents were a real and precarious prospect, even if the dirigible was tied to the mast, it could still swivel around and puncture itself on the sharp spires due to winds. This would cause some explosive decompression, and the ship would plummet to the ground. Legal matters also interfered with the mooring mast.

Another problem that is being hurled at the builders is the hydrogen being used in non-U.S. dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and it could possibly set the blimp and the building on fire.

The fate of the refined mast, however, still proved to have obstacles that would ultimately lead to the building's failure to fulfill its true purpose. The main reason was due to safety: as the dirigibles used hydrogen as opposed to helium, it would be of great danger to the building because hydrogen is highly flammable.

The building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. That would cost over sixty thousand dollars to build. Another problem that they would run into is that since the building is so high up in the sky, that there was violent air currents that cause high winds. That means if the dirigibles dock there, the front would be tied down, but the back end of the dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mooring mast. If they wanted to tie down the back then they would have to put dangling, leaded weights high above people on the street which was not safe. Lastley, another problem was that there was a law in place saying no ships could ever tie up to a building or even approach the area.

Their next obstacle was that the dirigibles weren't as safe as they had first thought. Most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen oposed to helium. Hydrogen was highly flammable, and if there happened to be an accident over New York City the outcome would be very dangerous. Also the dirigible wasn't unable to stay steady with all the wind so it would be unsafe to board. The final problem was the law against air carriers flying to low over urban areas.

Hydrogen is very flammable, and if an accident were to occur, it could be disastorous in such a populated area like New York. Also, because winds near the top of the building are always changing due to air currents, the ends of the dirigibles would swivel and turn dangerously.

People began to realize that all out-of-U.S. drigibles used hydrogen, not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it were to go ablaze above New York City, it would be disastrous. Another obstacle realized after the fact was that the back end of the drigible was unable to be weighted down. Because in open fields no pedestrians walk around under the heavyweights, it is not a problem to use the lead weights in open fields; however in a populous city, this is very dangerous. The last obstacle that was realized, perhaps one of the most significant obstacle, was that there was a law against airships flying too low over the buildings (for fear they would catch on buildings spires).

6,Environmental and technological factors were both factors in preventing the mooring mast for dirigibles from being built. The unadvanced technology from the 1920s prevented the docking from being safe for the people disembarking from a zepplin as well as the people in the surrounding areas. Attaching the mooring mast to the Empire State Building would weaken the buildings structure. The weather and violent winds also made it difficult for the dirigible to remain stationary. People's safety was more important than the mooring mast.,1.0,2.0

Also, the dense layout of the city itself was a huge obstacle due to fears of puncturing the balloon and causing a major accident.

Most dirigibles at the time were filled hydrogen gas rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and set afire, over a densely populated area like downtown New York, the results would be catastrophic. Engineers and building crews unfortunately never thought of these issues when designing the mast and once they realized the dangers the project was scrapped.

It was very dangeorous for a Dirigible to land close to any sharp objects. The only segurity holding the Dirigibles down was a cable that was pretty unsecred. Some dirigible did get in accident were they would burn. The reason why the Dirigibles caught on fire was because Dirigibles are full of helium and hydrogen. Many architects try to fix the problems but these went on years to be unsolved. They ether had to make the Dirigible smaller or change the structure of the Empire State Building. Neither of these ever happened.  The Empire State Building fail to be what it was supposed to become. Instead it is now partially a soda company aswell as a tea company.

Alas, the laws of nature and the country itself would never allow this to be.The mast itself took careful planning from builders so that it wouldn't be the downfall of the building but it was still no match for the elements. Maybe a ship mooring there wouldn't bring the whole building down, but rough winds would still push the ship around or even prevent its mooring, as in the Los Angeles' case.

Another reason why it would not work is because there was a pre-existing law in New York stating that airships could not fly at such a low altitude over urban areas because of the potential disasters involved.",3.0,8.0

With harmful winds to possibly push the dirigible, it was possibly to be winched around. Lastly, the last obstacle was that the builders had to work through knowing that they could be help making something that could kill people after hearing stories about Hindenburg.

The @NUM1 problem the builders faced was that the building itself was not strong enough to support the mast. To fix this, the building was modified and strengthened. Another obstacle was safety.  People worried a dirigible would catch on fire like the ""Hindenburg"" did in Lakehurst, @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest obstacle was the environment of New York City. The winds were always changing so when a dirigible was attached to the mast, it would still sway so it would have to be weighed down with lead weights which was not a safe thing since if one of weights happened to break off, it would kill people down on the street.

6,"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there resulted from having to design a practical way to create a mooring mast as well as the unsafe height of the landing area. As the roof of the Empire State Building was flat, architects needed to design the structure of the mooring mast that wouldn't put stress on the building's frame once a dirigible landed, so the steelf rame of the building had to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation (paragraph @NUM1)."" This was challenging for the builders, as they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars towards modifying the building's framework, which was extremely costly. Additionally, at a height of 1,250 feet, the winds on top of the Empire State Building were vicious and violently strong. Due to the dangerous air currents, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around (paragraph @NUM2)."" This was a huge obstacle for the builders because it raised great concern about how to allow dirigibles to dock there without putting the passengers aboard the dirigibles in danger of risking their lives, at such unsafe heights. To conclude, in ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the challenges the builders trying to construct docks for dirigibles there, were due to the difficulties faced in creating a simple design and the tall height of the Empire State Building, causing strong, dangerous winds.",4.0,10.0

The first obstacle, was designing the mast. A thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building would add stressed the building's frame. The dirigible's load and wind pressure would effect the building, which would have to be modifying eleven hundred feet below. So instead, they had to design a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. The second obstacle, was the safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable and in downtown New York which the dense population of fire could easily happen.

Most of these issues were due to the concern of safety, nature's affects, building stability, and existing laws.Safety was a major issue because of the setting of the Empire State Building and the nature of dirigibles. Hydrogen which is highly flammable was used in most dirigibles outside of the United States. If an accident was to ever occur where a dirigible burst into fire while trying to land on the Empire State Building, the densely populated area of downtown New York would be at a high fatality risk. Nature's effects of winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents would also create an obstacle as it would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mass. Dirigibles could also be moored down in the back by lead weights, but if these weights were to dangle above pedestrians on the street, it would cause a safety threat and would also be impractical. In order for a thousand-foot dirigible to be docked at the top of a building, builders would have to find a solution towards dealing with the excessive stress and pressure that would be added to the building's frame.

Any failure to secure the weights would end in tragedy. Another problem was the materials used in the dirigible. Dirigibles that entered U.S. use hydrogen to stay suspended. As we can see from the Hindenburg disaster, in which a hydrogen filled zeppelin caught fire and was destroyed, the compromise of safety could lead to a major disaster on the streets below.

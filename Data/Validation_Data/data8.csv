8," I had never met a person in my life, who could make anyone smile, turn their head, or know that that familiar voice coming from the stranger across the room, was a great person. I met this woman many years ago, camping at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 weekend, @DATE1. We had parked next to each other unknowingly, until her laughter poured out of her motor home's doors. This was the moment I knew @PERSON1, along with her family, would become great friends of mine. That weekend we had many family dinners together, including @CAPS1 dinner, went riding in good weather, along with bad, and shared memories neither one of our familys could ever forget. @PERSON1 was a great woman who had three beautiful children and a life she controlled every minute of, she always had a smile on her face, and a dog on her lap.  She has a free spirit and open mind to everyone and every moment she lived, I believe would be obvious to any stranger walking down the street. For the last several months I had the opportunity of living with @PERSON1 and her family, and we spent all day and @TIME1 with each other, playing rummy, swimming at all hours of the @TIME1, going to reggae concerts, trying to sing along to music we didn't really know, and just laughing at the smallest things. @PERSON1 was the kind of woman who takes in kids and animals off the streets, bathes, keeps warm and most of all loves them. She adopted her son's best friend, @PERSON2, after his mother kicked him out, and he has now been with her family for the last five years, I sure don't know anyone now a days who would do that, but @PERSON1 did. Anyone could walk into her home, uninvited and be welcomed like her own family, @PERSON1 would do anything and everything for people who might not do the same for her, but she knew that someday her kind heart would pay off.   @PERSON1 raised four amazing kids, and they all resemble her in every way. Each of them always keep an open mind to new things, new places and new people. Much like their mother, they would all give more than they would ever expect to receive back. It wasn't the sound or the idea of her laughter that drew people into her, its was a familiar voice to all, even to the unknown man. Her laughter could fill a room, and if you were close to her, you know who and where she was. Her laughter always gave others, along with myself, that no matter what race you were, orientation you lived by, years you had lived - basically whatever made you different to the person sitting next to you, @PERSON1 wouldn't put you out or leave you behind. Her mind, body, and soul was like swinging doors, opening both ways, she could always help you get to where you would like to go. During the speeches at her funeral, people always said she always did everything she could, she would help you in anyways possible, even if that required a loss for herself. Family friends commented that she just loved, lived and enjoyed every minute of it. Every person had something to say, and every word spoken about @PERSON1 was positive, filled with love, laughter, friendship, an idealistic life many would have liked to live. @PERSON1 chose her life, made each day worth it, spent every minute doing something she enjoyed. She was a great influence on my life, and now that she has passed, I would like to learn to live my life the way she did. With no worries at hand, a smile from ear to ear, and welcoming arms, @PERSON1 brought meaning to living a happy life.   I like to believe whatever took her to heaven gets to see her rainbow aurora, her silly contagious smile, and cherishes it. Because every person down here, misses her dearly, and each day, we hear her laughter, the sound of her motherly, yet best friend voice easily speaking to us. I miss her dearly, but the last several months, are dearly cherished, and will always be remembered. She taught me there is no second chances, if your late, your late. @PERSON1, had a heart of gold, and a laugh that spread love and life quicker than light travels. ",40.0,7.0
8,"                          Laughter is the @CAPS1 Laughter is an incredible thing. Laughter can bring families together, it can bring adversaries together, but most importantly, it can bring strangers together and start a wonderful or terrible relationship. Whether this relationship is terrible or wonderful completely depends on the individuals involved, but what matters most in a relationship of this form, is that it was created out of something as simple as laughter. I, myself, have had an unique experience with laughter that made a profound impact on my life. Laughter made me feel like I was giving something to the world instead of taking something from it. Laughter made me feel like I had done something good for a change. I used laughter in a time where there should be none to overcome my problems and help others do the same for themselves. This laughter brought strangers together and gave them the power to bring others joy and happiness through laughter. You can change a life with laughter. Laughter is an incredible thing. Not so long ago, (in @DATE1 to be precise), I got in trouble with the law. Before I get into too much detail on reasons of my legal issues, I would like to provide some background information to give an insight to how my brain works and how I think. Therefor, you can better understand my life and the decisions I had made to put myself is this predicament. I am the child of @PERSON2, a compassionate but judgmental woman from an upper-class family in the suburbs of @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @PERSON1, a persistent but controlling woman from a extremely low-class family in @LOCATION3. Please do not get my confused, I love both of my parents dearly and I am proud to be their son, and only because of this love I can openly admit their flaws. We all have flaws. There is no perfection is this or any universe. The reason this is important is because a child is raised with an essence of the parents within them. As their spawn I contain an essence from both of them. Part of them is part of me. A more unusual part of my childhood as I'm sure you have already discovered is: I am a son born to lesbian parents. Therefor, I have had an unusual childhood full of reality and life meaning questioning. I was taught to deal with this with Laughter. I learned to laugh at the irony of my life. And it is ironic that this same method of using laughter helped me overcome a majority of the problems I've encountered in this life of mine, including the one I am about to relay. In the @DATE1, I did get in quite a bit of trouble with the law. I was sent to a juvenile detention center in @LOCATION4, @ORGANIZATION1. I was required to spend six months in this place and go to mandatory group sessions. Here is where I met others like myself. Others that have had trouble with their reality in their life. Others that have been placed in this confinement for testing their reality. This group of mine met three times a week in the courtyard, maybe even four if the weather was permitting. We did not talk about the feeling remorse for our actions or feeling like we had done something wrong. Instead we focused on how we could deal with our reality questioning in a way that did not cause chaos, for others or for ourselves. We focused on rehabilitation. This was a good thing. We were not being told there was something wrong with us, but instead there were things that we could do to help us function in this life easier. At the beginning, I'm sure that non of the individuals that we assigned to these meetings took them seriously. The thought of going to a rehab session triggered guilt and anger. But as time passed I began to see that this really was for my benefit. I spread this new-found knowledge to my peers, and they soon made the same discovery I'd made.  In one of these group sessions, the leader told us that we should try and make something. Something as a group because to show that we were all similar and could connect to help eachother. While brainstorming on things we could make, I remembered using laughter to deal with the questions I encountered. I then got the idea of sharing this laughter with others by form of comedy. I shared this idea with the group and it sparked. We were making skits in the next five minutes. The next week, we had come up with a half-hour routine. It was so good we were chosen to run this in front of the whole detention center. I remember looking to the right of me while we preformed and seeing the smiling faces of not only the audience, but my fellow inmates. They both laughed together. We all laughed. Brought together by misfortune but joined together through laughter.",38.0,6.0
8," When settings change it can feel like everything is going to change with them. When I was in eighth grade, I felt that way. I knew that everybody in my grade was going to change schools the @DATE1 and we were going to be separated each other. It was hard to think about. Our grade was small: only eleven people and we were all close friends. We had grown up together for so many years and seen each other every day; it seemed so hard for us all to have the same kind of friendship when we were all apart. We spent our last weeks of school all together as a big group. We ate our lunches together and spent time together on our last eighth grade retreat. We all knew that after the @DATE1 was over we would not see each other every day like we were used to. So we built memories to make up for that future time when we would not bee together. We knew they were good ones when we would all laugh together. It was something that connected us in a shared experience--a shared emotion. Even though our time together was going to end, we knew that any memories we had would not. By freshman @DATE1 we were all continuing our lives apart. I was assimilated into my new school: I had met many new people, and had a lot of work in all of my new classes. I barely ever saw my friends from my old school during the @DATE1. Maybe only five or six times. I had my memories with them, but I could not spend time with them face to face. It was strange to go from seeing them every day to barely seeing them at all. One would think that things would be different between us all. Yet, somehow when we were together, it felt like nothing had changed. I realized that when I got together with my best friend from middle school one @DATE2 for a sleepover. The first fifteen minutes when we were together it was awkward. We hadn't seen each other in a while and were not sure what we needed to catch up on first. We ended up making small talk, something we almost never have had to do in the past. But after we talked for a while we started to get comfortable again and talk like we used to. She showed me her new high school yearbook and pointed out her friends so I had a better idea of who she was talked about when she told her stories. I described all of my new friends for her as well. We shared new stories and we remembered old ones. The best part was that we started to laugh. Not short giggles every once and a while, but full out laughter. She had her distinctive laugh, almost a guffaw. She would tilt her head back or lean backwards as she laughed. When she was done with a particular burst of laughter she would breath out in a sigh before starting up again. I had my distinctive laugh too. It wasn't a disticntive sound that made up my laugh, it was the action of falling over that made it mine. I would end up on the floor laughing almost to the point where I couldn't breath. But the near choking was still a good feeling. Even though all our stories and the people in them had changed, we still laughed together the way we used to. I was still able to recognize her laugh and she was able to recognize mine. They sounded and looked the same as they did in eighth grade when we were on our retreat. Despite all that had changed around us, we still had not changed at all. More importantly, our friendship hadn't changed. We just made new memories together with our new situation. Laughing the whole time.",39.0,6.0
8," As humans, we have the unparalleled ability to experience a vast range of emotions. Of course nobody relishes the feeling of embarrassment or that of a broken heart, but to compensate for these morose feelings we also have feelings of exuberance, rejoicing, and perhaps the greatest expression for them of all, laughter. It has been demonstrated to us by our own personal experiences that laughter is an immense aid in increasing the vivacity of our lives. Laughter is quite easily the safest, and most natural drug to feeling good, and it comes at a fantastic price; for free. Perhaps that is why I myself value comedic nature and optimistic thinking in contrast to my realistic perspective on things. Without it, how else would people be able to claw out of the sand traps of misery this world consumes us in? Whether we look for laughter or not, it always has a way of finding us, and on a sun soaked day @DATE1 it chose to find me. The streets carried a light cool in their breeze as it was not yet noon in @DATE4 and the cool morning air still slithered through the streets of @LOCATION1, fleeing the torturing sting of the @DATE1 sun. My sister and I were browsing the colorful stalls of the @DATE2 @CAPS1 while the sound of musicians played near some fountains and the smell of churros and elephant ears blanketed the area. Normally a day like this would have me incapable of untwisting the smile on my face, but @DATE6 was not like usual. An almost tangible wall of impatience and provocation stood between my sister and I belonging to the extremity of a relationship that is not easily conceivable to those without a sibling. Some days everything is just peaches and you are each others best friend. On other days the only desirable way of conversing is via short sentences barked through hormonal filled clouds of fury.  Needless to say it was a cloudy morning that day. Words spoken to one another came out as snide comments or rude remarks and it took every drop of composure we had to not initiate a full fledged battle between the other. The idea of spending the entirety of our day with the objects of our enmity was not in the least bit engaging, however,my grandmother's birthday was approaching next @DATE3 and even though it seemed like a mild form of torture, my sister and I made the decision to follow through with our plan to search for a suitable gift. If there was one person who had mediated any fight we had or solved the hardest of problems, it was my grandmother @CAPS2. And with that we stepped off of the max train into @LOCATION1. Agreeing on an item to buy does not come easily when the partner in your purchase won't speak to you. My sister and I milled about for an hour or so with no discoveries. Better yet, we ceased to find anything that would spark conversation enough to break the silent treatment policy we had instated. The sun skated to its midpoint in the sky and we both realized it was nearing lunch time. Making eye contact for the first time since our arrival, my sister nodded to the ice cream stand a few feet to my right. Shuffling to it we bought ourselves each a double scoop. Cookie @CAPS3 for me and @CAPS4 for her, disgusting. Keeping with the theme of the day we sat separately on a wall of stone steps near the fountain area to eat. But before I could even taste the cookie @CAPS3 flavor fill my mouth, I felt a very different sensation all together. The sensation of a cold, slightly sticky mass sliding down my chest and onto my stomach. Dumbfounded at how my ice cream had misplaced my torso for my mouth I said nothing, but glanced up to see my sister staring. We sustained eye contact for a few long seconds and I gradually felt my mouth mirror the smile that slowly blossomed on my sister's face. Suddenly something chimed in the air that nullified the wall that stood earlier. The noise was laughter and it babbled from us like a @DATE5 brook. After making our amends to each other for our hostile behavior before, our laughter continued long after we had cleaned me up as best as we could and shared my sister's repulsive @CAPS4 ice cream.  The medicine of laughter truly is the antidote to misery. It holds a universal key to unlock the grips of any obstacle one might face, regardless the expanses to which it pertains. On that day in @DATE4 a seemingly ill-fated day quickly metamorphosized into a resplendent memory, one I will never forget. Acknowledging that bickering with your sibling isn't nearly the most lethal of circumstances, I still strongly believe laughter can support in healing the deepest of wounds. When life throws you seeds of misfortune, try watering them with laughter. You never know just what @MONTH1 flourish.",40.0,7.0
8," Laughter is something that you should make an important part of your everyday life. In most cases laughter can brake the ice and can make people more comfortable with each other. When with friends and family most likely some of your best memory are made when there is something going on that made you laugh. Laughing not only puts yourself in a good mood but also every one around you. When you can make everyone laugh and put people in a good mood, in most cases you will be viewed as a fun, self confident person.  In the scorching @DATE1 my cousin @PERSON4, myself and two of his friends I had not met yet planned a camping trip. Our idea was that we are going down to the river about two miles away from @CAPS1 house and camp out for @NUM1 nights. We planed to make time the second day for us all to hike up the beautiful river to the falls for the day. When we first arrived i met is friends @PERSON2 and @PERSON3. We where all busy the first few hours setting up camp. Once camp was set up we made a fire and sat around it. The evening was awkward and silent for a short time because none of us other than @PERSON4 knew each other. Things started to get better when @PERSON4 started telling everyone about the prank war me and him had been having over the past few months. @CAPS2 started  "" this whole thing started when @PERSON1 put plastic wrap outside of my door so I ran in to it when i woke up in the morning."" I interrupted. "" no actually this started because @PERSON4 called me short and made fun of me, I cant help that im not tall.""  @CAPS2 continued his story about all the pranks we had pulled on each other like how i put butter all over his kitchen floor, then called his house phone so when @CAPS2 ran in there to answer it @CAPS2 slipped. @CAPS2 told of how @CAPS2 put his snake in my bed and scared me and how @CAPS2 filled my bathtub with green jello. After some good laughs we all warmed up and started talking and telling our own stories. Later that day we all went down to the river. @PERSON4 saw a small lime green frog and picked it up. @CAPS2 held it up to my face and said  "" kiss it @PERSON1 maybe it will turn in to a prince! "", I said "" no way dude im not going to kiss a frog"" @CAPS2 replied with "" and this is why you will never find true love @PERSON1 i mean you got to take a chance now and then you know.""I told him that I had a prince and @CAPS2 was much more handsome then the frog could ever become.  After a good time at the river we went back up to camp and ate dinner and talked some more around the fire. That night @PERSON4 broke the zipper on his tent so lucky me I had to share my tent with him. After everyone went to bed we went out of the tent and where getting something to eat when @PERSON4 said ""whoa did you see that!"" as @CAPS2 quickly looked up at the sky. Naturally I looked up and said ""what is it."" @CAPS2 just laughed at me because there was nothing there @CAPS2 just wanted me to look.  The next morning after breakfast me, @PERSON2, and @PERSON3 all went down to the river again and jumped in. @PERSON4 soon joined us. I noticed that there was a bunch of small fish in the water and i pointed them out to @PERSON4. The first thing @CAPS2 said was ""if you can catch one of those with your hands ill eat it hole"" I said ""your on"" so I struggled in the water trying to catch a little fish for around @NUM2 minutes. This whole time the guys are having fun laughing at me struggle and get all wet trying to catch the little fish. Finlay I got one! I walked over to @PERSON4 with the fish in my hand and smiled. @CAPS2 grabbed it out of my hand and put it in his mouth and swallow it, @CAPS2 quickly grabbed my hand and put it on his throat. I could feel the fish wiggling down his neck. I thought it was gross but then very funny because i didn't really expect him to do it.  The rest of the @ORGANIZATION1 consisted of some good laughs and some good memory's made. @PERSON2 somehow got coal from the fire on his forehead and we all giggled knowing @CAPS2 had no idea it was there for about @NUM1 hours. I caught @PERSON3 singing and dancing to himself by the river one evening, it was pretty hilarious but I kept that one to myself. Over all the camping trip was one of the best. I had a great time and made some new friends. It is truly an experience I will not soon forget.",42.0,7.0
8," I was visiting some of my friends that lived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, it was awesome. When I was traveling @CAPS1 there it was so freaking hot some days I had to stop @CAPS2 cool off at a hotel that had a swimming pool, it was sweet thing to do after driving a lot. When I finally got to my friends house she was ecstatic to see me her name was @PERSON1. @PERSON1 @CAPS2 I really liked each other, so I decided to ask her out on a date. we went to this club call @CAPS1 on the town it was a make shift club for @NUM1 @CAPS2 older but, we knew the boucer @CAPS2 he would let us in all the time back in the day. We started dancing @CAPS2 getting real close @CAPS2 then out of the blue she kissed me @CAPS2 I said ""wow that was great i might have to move @CAPS1 here because of that."" @CAPS2 @PERSON1 said ""maybe you have to."" @CAPS2 that was a very good welcome party. The next day she took me around to see an old friend I'm surprise that he wasn't in jail or worst dead. We went to see our old friend @PERSON2 he turned @NUM1 a week ago or so. He has changed a lot since the last time I've seen him. Last time I had seen him he was @NUM3 foot @NUM4 inches this was two years ago but now he @NUM5 foot @NUM6 inches oh my gosh! Talk about a change. Not only he was the most funniest guy I ever knew in @LOCATION1 was my best frind I ever had that is the one thing I hope that will never ever change with him @CAPS2 he one of those guys that knew what time to stop unlike some people I know We were all hanging out at @ORGANIZATION1's house just chilling on a hot @DATE1 day @CAPS2 it started to get boring just sitting so we started to walk around the neighbor hood @CAPS2 then we started cracking jokes. They were some inappropriate joke I'm not gonna write in this but you can just imagine @CAPS2 we just laughed @CAPS2 laughed @CAPS2 laughed some more it was such a good time I didn't want to leave @LOCATION1 ever but I had a good job @CAPS2 everything. So when @PERSON1 @CAPS2 I got back to her place I asked to get on her computer @CAPS2 see if the company I was working for is @CAPS1 here in @LOCATION1 hopefully close to @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2 because then I can stay @CAPS1 here @CAPS2 have all the fun I'm having right now forever. @CAPS2 I would have a great girlfriend that I will marry soon. So I finally found it. there was one place that my store was located in @LOCATION2 that my company has in @LOCATION1 but I would have to start from the bottom @CAPS2 build my way to the top again. So I stop @CAPS2 thought about for the rest of the night.  I had probably stayed up for about @NUM7 hour thinking about the pro's @CAPS2 con's of this decision because this is life changing decision, leave everything in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 be happy in @LOCATION1 or stay in @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 bemiserable @CAPS2 have everything? Hard question what would you do? I decided when I'm @NUM1 to come back @CAPS1 here @CAPS2 be happy because I knew that I will be a lot happier in @LOCATION1 with @PERSON1 then alone in @LOCATION3 miserable @CAPS2 since I have moved here i felt like i never belong but in @LOCATION1 i was the man @CAPS2 I only had to wait one more year till all of that comes true @CAPS2 it's all because of laughter @CAPS2 how happy she made me @CAPS2 that's what I look for in a women because that is what I like. That is the foundation for all basic friendships is having a good personality. @CAPS2 that is my story. I can't wait till I'm eighteen. ",38.0,6.0
8,"   Someone once said ""laughter is the shortest distance between people."" @CAPS1 matter the contrasting conditions that two people @MONTH1 live, they both feel the same unconditional sensation when they are laughing. I will tell a story about myself in a relationship and how laughter is what made that relationship so great. In a previous relationship I was in started off as one of the most positive experiences that I had ever been involved in. Her and I understood each others personalities and each others jokes. It was constant flirting about how cute each other was, and thinking about how in the world you two hadn't met before. but after a few months thing tend to change. Once you are with someone for a period of time, you start to notice certain flaws that they have. They @MONTH1 be miner things, but depending on what they are, some are a little more mind altering. But most of her flaws in my eyes were extremely cute, because of her being imperfect i was attracted to her even more. Months later we started to argue and stuff leading to a harsh and slow break-up, but ow that we are broken up, I don't remember us arguing. I remember how much we laughed, and how happy we made each other.  One thing that I have learned from this experience is that @CAPS1 matter what happened, I remember that fun, laughter, and passion is all I remember when I was with her. Even though her and I splitting up had broke my heart.",35.0,6.0
8,"Laughter between a relationship works because you can always find out if that person is being himself or trying to be something he isn't. People some times think that everything is funny when it ain't that funny, most say laughing is like bringing up a smile on your face. Telling jokes or watching home videos that make you laugh and bring out joy to most people, you and your friends @MONTH1 think that it might be easy to laugh at everything you do or say... and then they are going to be confused at the end and ask what was so funny about that? One day me and a couple of friends were watching ""@CAPS1's most funny videos"" and all of my friends busted out laughing when a little kid rolled down the hill and hurt himself. So then later that day we went to go watch a movie the theater and we saw ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"", my friends thought it was funny and, the next day we were laughing about the movie still, because it was still funny so we rented that movie so our parents can watch it they were non stop on talking bout it too. So, now we are having all of family and friends little small get together, cause since they like to laugh it would be best for them and us five to watch a movie that has a lot of comedy for us. After the movie we all ate out and the parents were talking about how often they should hang out more often. Our parents went out every @DATE1 and we thought that they totally for got all about their own kids. We made a plan for them to come home so they can realize that its just not all about them. @NUM1 minutes later one of us called their parents to come home cause their was a fight happening with the other two friends. So now the parents were rushing home to get to the bottom of this. The parents asked what was going on, and we told them to sit down and talk, so we did and we told them that its just not about them they have to stay home and take care of us so we wont have to feel like you don't care bout us any more.",36.0,6.0
8,"  The most important things in this word for to have good relationship is laugh, and to be happy. This two elements are the most important for any relationship, if we practice this two things we can have a nice relationship.   This story was about two persons who met at a party. They will began as friends in the party, then show they had the same sinpativilidad, because they always laughed. Then they started to talked about what they like to do,and important things. Afterward, he asked to her if she wanted to be his girlfriend, she told him let me think. A few minutes @DATE1 she answers to him ""yes"".   When they have a year of dating, they never complained about their relationship in between them, because they never get mad each other for nothing,also they always told each other that anger was not good for a couple relationship, if never laugh is a very bad for a relation between two people, and also has to be more communication each other. well, they always kept a nice relationship between them, because they like that people told them, they were a happy couple, and they always laugh. Also, because they always like to show people they never get angry each other.  @DATE1,they decided to have a baby, because a family without a baby is not a happy family.

When the girl when to the school for first time, she felt very proud of her parents, because the people always told to her ,that her parents were some people very happy ,and they always laughed. she felt very happy to have good parents, and the people recognize as a happy family and not a family not happy. when she was a adult person she would always remember the beautiful relationship that exist between her parents , and she always keep the nice words people said about her parents. the girl always says that when she marriage she will keep it from her parents relation, and she would like to find a man like her father, because she like the happy man.

8,"Laughter is a motif of life, you never see laughter fade, or disappear. This recurring element that you see in daily life, is easy to come by, like sand on a beach or stars in the sky.While you are at @CAPS6, one of the only ways you can get through the day is with laughter. During @CAPS6, in that boarded up classroom with no windows, your teacher assigned homework and everyone's moods are in the dumps. So what do you do? You point somewhere in the class and yell,""@CAPS1's snowing!"" and everyone looks for a window look and see the white blanket of snow on the ground, but then they realize that there are no windows, and @CAPS1's @DATE2. This sort of thing can raise the spirits of those once, ""@CAPS2 so happy kids"", and for a while so they can forget the @NUM1 root words they have to find examples and write sentences for. Although laughter isn't always a short item of use though, sometimes you can see something every day.  In particular, when I was going into @CAPS3 @CAPS4, I didn't have many friends. When I went to my first class I was hoping that my best friend was going to be there because I didn't know anybody. Time passed, I told a few jokes here and there, keep in mind, @CAPS2 knock-knock jokes, but I was just easygoing and made people laugh. Even though I wasn't the most good looking guy around I had a few of the more popular ladies laughing with me and we had a good time. In that same way, when I started @CAPS4 @CAPS6, this same thing happened to me. @CAPS10 @CAPS6 taught me how to be outgoing and fun, when I got to @CAPS4 @CAPS6 I just needed to apply that. During this time I've been making more fiends through sports and social events, so I know a lot of the that we're in my grade at the time. So I came confident, and ready to laugh.  During @CAPS10 @CAPS6 a few things happened to me that were also extremely funny as well. During my @NUM2 grade @CAPS12 season we just started playing for the actual @CAPS6, @CAPS2 @CAPS13-@CAPS14, so we got these fancy warm-ups that we got to wear before games. These warm-ups had buttons along the side so you could rip them off right before you go in, and we liked doing that a lot because @CAPS1 was fun at the time. When we were well into the @DATE1 of out season, we went to one of our away games, even though this was one of our neighboring schools. Before the game started they called out the starters, which I was one of, and ripped off my warm ups saying,""@CAPS15 @CAPS16!"", as I mimicked his hip thrust move. Consequently, I wasn't wearing my team shorts and just my underwear. At this point, I was extremely embarrassed and my whole team started laughing. Finally after I went and got my shorts, I came back into the game to try to make my troubles fade away as my teammate made the game winning basket. The next day everyone wasn't laughing at the misfortune of my shorts, but the amazing game winning shot.  We all know that laughter in a critical part of life, scientists even say @CAPS1 helps you live longer, you can have laughter in and situation and everywhere you go @CAPS1 will follow. People say that love is the @CAPS17 language, but I would have to disagree. You always see laughter, everywhere you look, everywhere you go @CAPS1 will be there.

8," This is going to be a story about humor and senses of humor. Every single person has there own senes to laugh and some people laugh more than others, and some people laugh less than others, I guess it just all depends on the person, the mood, and the people they se of humor, there are an extravagant varieties of humor, for example sarcasm, random, scary, senseless, and many more. I believe we laugh because, we all have stress and a lot of it, and when all that stress and built up feelings get to a certain capacity we laugh its just a normal natural human instinct that we can not always control. But I am not just saying we only laugh cause we are stressed we laugh cause we are happy, and because those people who have humor make you laugh. everybody lovare around with senses of humor.  Having a good sense of humor can get you a lot of things popularity, friends, girlfriends, boyfriends, but it can also get you in trouble. The ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is what we call it, the ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is basically the risk taker of the @CAPS1, that person or persons will make a joke towards a student, or to the teacher to get the students of the classroom to laugh, and these ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" jokes usually result in embarrassment to the student or teaexchange student at our school and looked @CAPS7, but had a french accent people would refer to her as ""frenchie"" or that ""french girl"". The ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" is usually in most cases a funny person to be around because they have a great sense of humor but when the deliberately use someones nationality to harass them to make peoplecher. And how most of these things seem to be funny they do not take others peoples feeling into consideration (sometimes). For example if we had a new foreign laugh that is wrong and harsh and not right to whomever that person is. having a good laugh every once in a while is good for all of us, it absolutely is an awesome stress reliever, and after you get a few good laughs in you, i can almost guarantee you will have a better rest of the day, or a better next day. there is never a bad time for good joke to get your day going, it's like ""your morning cup of coffee"".",36.0,6.0
8," Moving is never an easy thing to do. You have already established some very goods friends, and now you have to leave them. Recently, that is just what I have done. My most recent move from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2 has been an extremely difficult thing for me to do because I had created such strong ties with my friends back in @LOCATION1. But through good times and bad, my friends in @LOCATION1 have always been there to give me a good laugh or two when I need it the most. When I seem to be down or low, they always seem to know how to fix it, even when I am nearly six-hundred miles away. Before I left, my girlfriends decided to throw me a surprise ""going-away"" party. They went all out; balloons, a cake, games, and movies. The absolutely best thing, though, was that we all watched the movie The @ORGANIZATION1. It's one of those teenage girl movies that is so stupid , yet it makes you laugh so hard that you cry! My friends and I would constantly quote the movie back and forth to each other in school, through texts, or whenever else we could. I thought that @ORGANIZATION1 was the funniest thing, and my friends knew that, so when they brought it to the party, I was ecstatic! We watched it, I think, three times in a row. We laughed, and laughed, and then laughed some more. I think we actually laughed so hard that it had looked like we had been crying for a few hours! Each time a scene came on that we knew the lines to, we would quote them back and forth to each other; it was absolutely hysterical! Needless to say, all of us were brain dead the next morning. The next day came, and the party was over. We all had finally begun to realize that it was the last day I would get to hang out with my friends again (or at least until I go back in the @DATE1). There were tears shed and hugs all around, but we couldn't get past the fact that we might not see each other again. Yes, there is @CAPS1 that we could chat on; we can call or text each other; but it is just not the same as being able to have your friends right there beside you. The following @DATE2 at school, as I was turning in the last of my books, I gave my final hugs goodbye. I couldn't help but cry, knowing that they would miss me just as much, or maybe even more, as I would miss them. I made my way towards the school's front doors, when I heard one of my friends yell my name. I turned around to look at her, and she yelled at me in her deepest ""man voice"" possible, ""@CAPS2 me, do you know where the crapper is? I need to do something mysterious in there,"" now in a whisper, but still in a a manly voice, ""drop off some timber!"" I couldn't help but burst into a fit of laughter. That was our favorite quote from @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1! My girlfriends and I used to run up and down the halls of the school practically yodeling that quote back and forth to each other.We all exploded into giggles and laughs, with tears coming down like @ORGANIZATION2. They even followed me out to my car as I walked out, still quoting more of @ORGANIZATION1 movie. After that, I knew that everything would be okay. Living in @LOCATION2, about six-hundred miles from my hometown in @LOCATION1, hasn't stopped me from keeping in touch with my friends. We call each other; we send letters, and we even chat on @CAPS1. We are always updating each other with news of new boyfriends, school, and just life in general. My friends will always be there for me, no matter what kind of a situation I am in, and they are always willing to put a smile on, not only my face, but on the faces of those around them. The best thing about my girlfriends is that they have given me a memory that I can look back to and get a good laugh about. Anytime I need a little ""pick-me-up"" to help me feel better about things, I always remember my last day in @LOCATION1.",42.0,7.0
8," My Story @CAPS1 Laughter    Laughter it can cheer you up on dark rainy days, or it can turn a fun moment into a loving one. Whether you're with friends, your kids, wife, or family members a few laughs are always going to be shared. I'm going to tell you @CAPS1 a time with my girlfriend her names @PERSON1. @PERSON1, @PERSON2, @PERSON3 and I decided we were going to go to the movies. Well two days before I lost my cousin @CAPS2, so I figured that @TIME1 could take my mind off things.     I was waiting for @PERSON1's mom to pick me up i was eager and exited. After @CAPS6 picked me up we were headed to @PERSON1's then off to the mall once @PERSON3 got there. We got to @PERSON1's I went in her room being followed by @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. I plopped my self down on @PERSON1's bed then @PERSON1 jumped and we were both laying on her bed waiting for @PERSON3.     We began talking @CAPS1 how long @PERSON3 was taking to get to her house, @PERSON2 added in that ""@CAPS3 drives like a grandma."" We all started laughing. Once @PERSON3 got to @PERSON1's @CAPS3 came in her room and laid next to @PERSON2. @CAPS3 told me that ""I look dead."" I told him what had happened to my cousin and whats been going on lately. @CAPS3 told me ""@CAPS3 was sorry to hear that i have been having a hard time."" and i generously said ""@CAPS5 you and ill pull through."" We decided to go to taco bell after our stomachs started growling. Once we got there I was so @LOCATION1 that I didn't know what to get so I just said ""I'll take @NUM1 bean and cheese burritos."" @CAPS6 all looked over and called me fat. I told them that if I didn't get full that I would've ended up eating them, we all laughed.    After eating, @PERSON3 asked if we wanted to go to the mall and hangout, we all decided that that would be a good idea. all of us went into @ORGANIZATION1 and were looking at shirts hats etc. and I saw @TIME1 shirt so I picked it up and unfolded it. It was a model and she had a huge butt! We all laughed and we laughed @CAPS1 it for several hours. We stayed at the mall later then we should have, it was closing in past curfew and the mall was closing so we decided to go home. Even though @TIME1 not seem exiting to you it was fun to me and I had a great time hanging out with my girlfriend that I love and my friends that make me happy!",35.0,6.0
8," During the @DATE1, I decided to take a step outside of my comfort-zone and do something extraordinary. I didn't know how this decision was going to change my life. One hot @DATE1 day in @LOCATION1, a bus was making its way to @LOCATION2.The bus was full of excited and worry-free people. When the bus crossed the border, however, the expression on people's face changed dramatically. A border, a mere line on the map, represents so much more. One side of the border was remarkably better than the other. It was as if the two sides were two different worlds. On one, people live in the most comfortable settings, whereas in the other, it seemed like they don't have what they need to keep themselves alive. As the bus took us through this 'new' world, the expression of shock was shared by everyone. As we approached closer to the camp site, we were able to get a better glimpse of the houses, or so they were called. The buildings had cracks all over the walls which made it seem like they would collapse in any minute. This was not, could not be someone's home.  On the first day of work, we were introduced to a family for whom we were to build a house. This family was consisted of a young mom and her kids. There were @NUM1 kids, and the older one was in middle school. The father was nowhere to be found. As we got to work, the family observed. The expression on their faces was very difficult to read. However, for every smile we gave, they returned. During the little breaks, I was able to get to know the older one, the boy, better. As a student who took @CAPS1 in high school, the means of communication was limited. The thing that connected us was an old soccer ball. The boy had a soccer ball that he carried around almost wherever he went. When I saw the ball, I hesitated. I hesitated because I knew that the language barrier would annoy me. I approached him anyways. Then an amazing thing happened. The guy, without hesitation, passed me the ball. We juggled the ball back and forth for a while. He would perform a trick and pass. I would do the exact same trick that he did and add one of my own. Then he would mimic mine and add one. We played and played without much words being exchanged. He talked in @CAPS2 and I talked in @CAPS3, and strangely, it felt like we somewhat understood each other. And the laughter, oh, the laughter we had!  One the second day when I arrived at the work station, the first thing I looked for was my new buddy. He was not there; he was still at school. So under the blazing sun, I went to work. After a couple hours, my favorite time of the day came: the lunch time. Oh, the sweet taste of the short @DATE1 was priceless. While we were eating our lunch, I saw my friend walking up the hill. The lunch was almost over by then, so I did not get to play with him. However, he invited me to come play soccer with him. Without hesitation, I gave him a nod. After that though, I was worried. I can't speak @CAPS2, so there wouldn't be much communication between the team members and me. Knowing that communication is crucial in every team sports, I was even more worried. After the work was over, I went to play soccer on the little field. There were lots of guys playing already. We were introduced to the players, and we found out that one of them speaks fluent @CAPS3. He told us not to worry if we can't understand them and that they are just having fun; and the fun began. As we started playing, there weren't much exchanges of words, but there was something greater being exchanged: the laughter. Whenever someone would perform a cool trick and beat the defender or fail miserably, we would laugh and laugh. In the duration of the game, I started to feel as if I had known these guys forever. On that day, I had the privilege of knowing the most passionate people towards the sport that I love the most, and I don't even know their names. It didn't matter, though. I received the most precious gift: friendship. How could anyone say that there is something greater out there than friendship? On that day, I realized how I can make friends without much effort; a truthful laughter was all I needed. After our work was done in @LOCATION2, we drove back to the @CAPS6. While we were crossing that border once again, I noticed that my prospective towards things have been changed noticeably. I no longer saw the one world being better than the other. They were still different: in one world, people have all the things they want, yet are not content. In the other, people don't have much, yet they seemed so happy.",39.0,6.0
8," Have you ever laughed so hard that you got a belly ache? or laughed until you cried? Well I have and it was just one of those simple days hanging out with a best friend. @PERSON1 and I have been best friends since the @NUM1 grade. We had a lot of fun times together and we would get those moments of laughter where we got a belly ache and laughed until we cried. But on @DATE1 was a night to remember. We had been planning for us to hangout but since my dad was gone for the @DATE2 and her moms birthday on the same day we had no where to go. We finally decided to stay at my house. We were just two typical teenagers haven fun. @PERSON1 was that paranoid type. I remember walking by the door and knocking on it while she was on the computer, it scared her so much I laughed so hard. She laughed too but was holding a grudge against me the whole night. We finally settled in after drinking some energy drinks to stay awake. We decided to play a game called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. To play the game you need @NUM2 or more players. I prefer more players because its more fun and you get tons of laughter. You pull a card and on the card it says a phrase that's mixed up kinda like a tongue twister. On the flip side of the card is the correct phrase. You have your partner read the card and try to guess what the phrase says. Its hilarious because the person reading the card has no idea what he/she is saying but you can. The idea of the game is that its not what you say, its what you hear.  I pull a card for @ORGANIZATION1 to read. The side of the card I read says the phrase ""@CAPS3 of soap"" and the flip side of the card that @PERSON1 was reading says ""@CAPS4 soap"". As soon as she reads the phrase I start laughing! I don't think I have ever laughed so hard in my life! @PERSON1 keeps saying and keeps saying it over and over again. It was so funny she had no idea what she was saying. I finally calm down and tell her to say it slowly. As soon as she got it we both went into a @CAPS1 rage of laughter. It was a big element the night @PERSON1 and I hung out. Now today we look at each other and when we say the phrase we go into laughter all over again.  I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. I'm thankful for the laughing times we have together and who knows a simple game can turn a normal family setting into great fun. Not only do you bond with your family and friends, you learn a lot about them. I do believe laughter is an important part in any relationship. Being happy and not worrying about the small things in life can take you a long way and make you happier. I think laughter is essential to the world we live in. ",37.0,6.0
8,"Laughter between two people can make or break a relationship in anyone's lifetime. It can make you slap your side and your ribs ache as you gasp for a breath when someone said a very funny joke or it can quiet and subtle in a theater or late night movie time as you watch a comedy that you really enjoy with loved ones. For example when I was in @NUM1 grade, around the end of the year I had the pleasure to meet a son of one the families that just moved into the neighborhood, now I use the word pleasure rather loosely for meeting him wasn't very fun at all because he kept laughing nervously or hysterically when I said something funny or witty which freaked me out a bit. Laughter can also strengthen a relationship whether it based on love or friendship, like when it comes to dating. Closer to the present day close to spring an old friend of mine came back to @ORGANIZATION1 from @LOCATION1 and we started to hand out, recently she told me I was a pretty guy and that is one of the reasons she loved hanging out with for few people could even make her smile let alone make her laugh near as much as I made her do so. Because of this one fact of being able to relax and enjoy each others company with laughter her and I started dating proving that if you can get someone to laugh it can strengthen friendships or bring them to the next level. Laughter is a very crucial part of my social and family life, my siblings and I are constantly making fun or poking at each other with sarcasm or fun pranks and if I were not able to laugh and shrug some of the things they do off then or relationship would've taken a nose dive into rock bottom years ago. If you can't laugh you can't be happy and if you can't be happy then you will find less and less people wanting to be around you and express themselves freely with you except for those who are similarly unhappy and hold a grudge against life. Remember laughter can make or break any relationship, if it's the weird hysterical laugh of the socially awkward that frightens away most who are near or the rich laugh of someone who is genuinely happy about something that draws others to them, just stick to that one fact and you are one step closer to a happier life filled with laughter and good times.",32.0,5.0
8,"  ""I have to go pee."" @CAPS1 @PERSON1.  ""@CAPS2 shouldn't have drank so much of that iced tea then."" I replied. @CAPS5 rolled her eyes and kept walking. When we finally arrived at safeway, as the automatic doors slid open @PERSON1, without hesitation, sprinted to the bathrooms. I walked to the bakery to pick out some doughnuts to buy, when I turned around I saw @PERSON1 walking angrily towards me.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS2 have a nice pee?"" I asked, chuckling a little.  ""@CAPS4! I didn't even go. The bathrooms are out of service."" @CAPS5 huffed.  ""@CAPS6 @CAPS2 can go when we get to my house, my step mom is almost off of work."" I said. @CAPS5 nodded her head while @CAPS5 fidgeting her legs. Twenty minutes later, we were in my step moms car going back to my place, it got much worse. @CAPS5 was barely holding it in, @CAPS5 kept telling me over and over @CAPS5 was going to explode and couldn't hold it in much longer. I laughed everytime and told her we were almost there. When we arrived at my place @CAPS5 bolted out of the car, bending over, and running towards my front door with her legs twisted. I thought I was going to die of laughter, just seeing her run was the funniest thing I had ever seen. @CAPS5 looked like an ostrich running. My step mom quickly unlocked the door and @PERSON1 was already downstairs in the bathroom before I even got inside.  I yelled down to her,""@CAPS7 didn't @CAPS2 just go to the bathroom up here?""  ""@CAPS8, I forgot about that one."" @CAPS5 replied. I chuckled a little more.   @PERSON1 and I have a lot of great memories because of laughter. It seems like everyday we always have something to look back on and laugh about. I feel it's helped us become best friends over time. We laugh a lot together and always joke around about those times. Laughter is important in any friendship, but it's also important in family relationships too. My brother and I share weird experiences together, we'll laugh about the most random things and also look back on those memories. It brings us much more closer together. Lastly, laughter is important in a love relationship. My boyfriend and I always have something to laugh about wherever we go. It seems like everytime I am with him we just see or hear something funny. We have a lot of memories together and just like my relationship with @PERSON1 and my brother, it's brought us closer and happier.   Laughter is the key to happiness, it's important in any kind of relationship. Most of my memories are made from just laughing. Not only does it create memories, but it also creates happiness. It's like medicine, usually when I'm sad my friends cheer me up by trying to make me laugh. Some people also laugh when they're in a nervous situation, they just don't know how to cope with the awkward situation so they laugh to hide that they are nervous. I feel that laughing will also bring two people closer together, as I said before, it creates memories. Having memories with someone will build a stronger relationship with them. Which is @CAPS7 it's an important part in any relationship. I agree with ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"", it definitely is. Laughter holds a lot of power, but I also feel it holds bad power too. Laughter can make some people feel bad. If @CAPS2 laugh at someone because of what they look like or something they @CAPS3, that's going to make them feel sad. But in the end, laughing holds much more good power then bad.",42.0,7.0
8," Laughter is one of the best elements in my life. I know that without laughter I wouldn'@CAPS1 be happy or even myself at all. Laughing or making someone laugh can just change your day and make it better that's really why I enjoy it, and that's also why I believe that it's an important part of any relationship. My friends and I have so many memories and times where we can look back and remember laughing so hard that we just might pee. Here's just one story where laughter was a big part of our @TIME1. One nice @DATE1 @TIME1 my friends (@PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1) and I were having a sleepover at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were very bored and needed something to do. So like any other sleepover we made a list of fun things to do. One of the first things on the list was to do makeovers. So we did our make-up but not how we usually would though, instead we took all the bright colors of eye shadow that we could find and started to make different designs and shapes all over our faces. Sometime during the makeover @PERSON2 wanted to use some glitter for her face but in was in this small little container and it was very hard to open. We all gave it a try in opening the glitter but finally @PERSON1 tried it one last time and right when she opened it the glitter spilled everywhere! It was so funny, we all started cracking up laughing. It was literally everywhere, all over the bathroom floor and even in our hair. We all took some glitter so that it wouldn'@CAPS1 @CAPS2 to waste. As we were finishing up on our makeovers it was time to take pictures. All of us were wearing pretty sun dresses and now that our make up was done it completed our outfits. So there we were taking pictures and making funny faces making each other laugh, we call it our photo shoot since we always take a bunch of pictures.  Once we were done taking pictures we decided to make a funny video. We would just make up characters and pretend things like as if we were on a @CAPS1.V show and that we would be having a special performer on the show. Silly things like that made us laugh so much it @MONTH1 sound stupid but it really made us laugh and we were having a good time. I remember this specific time when @PERSON2 and I were the hosts and my name was waffles and @PERSON2's was toast, and the performer that we introduced was hash-browns and ketchup. Silly things like that, that really didn'@CAPS1 make sense made us laugh and laugh all @TIME1 long. After our little video we started to get hungry so we decided to have a picnic. Even though it was already dark outside we decided that it wouldn'@CAPS1 be a real picnic if it wasn'@CAPS1 outside. So we grabbed all the blankets that we could find and placed them on the ground on the porch. Since @LOCATION1 is such a fabulous chef she made all of our food. She made her specialty macaroni and cheese, for a healthy appetizer she brought some fresh fruit, and I believe that she made popcorn too just in case we wanted to watch a movie. Of course our meals together are far from normal. @PERSON2 is a very competitive person so whenever she was the chance to compete with someone she takes it. during our meal @PERSON2 asks if anyone would like to have a macaroni eating contest with her, and right away I agreed that I wanted to. We both had a small bowl of @LOCATION1's macaroni and when @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2!"" the competition was on. Right when we started @LOCATION1 was making silly comments and cracking jokes so I would start laughing, and it worked. As I struggled to finish my bowl @PERSON2 was already done. What could I say, she must have had a bigger appetite than me that @TIME1. That sleepover was one of the most memorable and funny one's that I could think of. Whoever said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" they were right. No matter what kind of day one @MONTH1 be having or whatever mood one @MONTH1 be in with a little laugh it can make their day that much better. I know that when I'm around my friends I'm sure to have a good time and for sure have a good laugh.",38.0,6.0

8,"  ""@CAPS1 is six afraid of seven?"", because seven eat nine. Hahahaha! Laughter plays a very important part in everyone's life. Laughter can be good or bad. In my life I like to laugh a lot because it shows off my happiness inside.   Laughing helps digest food, not only is laughing healthy for you, but it can also cheer people up. When somebody is down or has been crying, a great way to make them feel better is to make them laugh. When I laugh or somebody makes me laugh, I feel warm and fuzzy inside and happier. I think I laugh the most when I'm around all my friends. When I'm around my friend's, it seems we laugh about the silliest things. I like hearing people laugh. When I hear people laugh I get to see there smiley faces.   On the other hand laughing can sometimes be a negative thing and make situations worse. Like telling a joke it can go to ways. If you are telling blonde jokes and a person with blonde hair is around eavesdropping, they might not think the joke is funny. Laughing can also be a negative thing if your laughing at someone and making fun of them.  When I eat my dinner, I eat at the kitchen table with my family. I like eating at the dinner table just some times it can be a little awkward. When I'm eating dinner with my family we talk about odd things, and we laugh a lot. I like laughing at the dinner table, because it makes things less awkward. Plus it helps to digest your food.  Laughing does great things to the world, I think it makes it happier. I really enjoy laughing over the little things in life. Laughing creates fun loving memories. Someone once said "" Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"".",32.0,5.0

We got to see ourselfs when we were little and ridding the rides and running around @ORGANIZATION1. Towards the end I have to admit was the @CAPS2 part of the whole @CAPS4. By this time I was laying on the floor in the living room geting ready to fall asleep becuase it was getting late and my eyes were starting to get heavy whe all of a sudden my mom and brother and sister started to laugh so hard they almost fell out of their seats.

Even though @CAPS2 walked beside me, and I knew that @CAPS2 was colder than I, I couldn't help @CAPS3 imagine burying myself in his warm and comforting black jacket. Walking through the gardens of the park, we kept a space of overflowing tension between us. My entire body was annealed and my heart was practically pounding through my chest in pure agitation. I wanted to look at him, directly at his face and straight into his blue-green eyes. I wanted to try and find something to tip me in on what @CAPS2 was feeling at this very moment; @CAPS3 I didn't dare even sneak a glance. I was afraid that my eyes would reveal all that I dream of and how much I love him. The boy who had moved here over the @DATE1 and came into my life by simply replying to a note I had written in hesitance. The one who's made me cry, smile, laugh and scream in agony. The one who's unknowingly brought me down to my knees in mercy of the emotion known as love; the very thing I had come to realize that I was deathly afraid of. Now there @CAPS2 was, walking beside me in a water drenched wonderland. The sky was gray, with clouds plump with rain that fell lightly. @CAPS1 soaked the ground and made the trees glisten. @CAPS1 was beautiful, @CAPS3 even though @CAPS1 was as such, there was still that hint of sadness. At least @CAPS1 fit the mood that drowned our auras as we walked. I led him farther through the gardens until we reached a vast clearing. Still in a calm hush we walked until we reached a small white gazebo with a view of the river swiftly rushing by only a few feet away. I sat down on a bench that wrapped around a circular post in the middle of @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 quietly sat down near me. The moment was awkward, @CAPS3 after a few minutes we started talking. No later had ten minutes passed, when @CAPS2 began to open most of himself up to me. @CAPS2 told me stories of his life, which weren't the least bit happy in any way, shape or form. Most times they made me want to cry because they broke my heart and tore me to shreds. I know @CAPS1 seems kind of pathetic, @CAPS3 having a rocky past myself, my heart and sense of personality has been twisted and bathed in sensitivity. With that sense of metamorphosis, I've come to be a better person. I care more and worry about the people I love. @CAPS1's honestly just who I am. After a couple hours of this, @CAPS1 soon became silent again. I finally looked over at him only to see him staring down intently at his hands with his back slightly turned to me. His medium-length blond hair covered his face, hiding the view of his expression. His entire body was shaking, and even though the wind was chilly, I knew that @CAPS2 wasn't shaking because of @CAPS1. There was more to @CAPS1 than that, I was sure of @CAPS1. After a few minutes of debating on what I should do, I slowly raised my hand and rested @CAPS1 on his shoulder. His shaking stopped instantly. Time seemed to pass by quickly after that, and the next thing I knew we were both standing and simply hugging each other. ""I'm sorry that things have been so bad for you."" I whispered. ""@CAPS1 isn't your fault."" @CAPS2 replied, hugging me tighter. I nodded slightly, @CAPS3 deep inside I still felt the same. I still wished that I could bring him happiness, and I guess after all this hard work I've been putting myself through, I'm slowly getting there. After we finally released the hug, I looked around and noticed that the air was getting warmer and patches of blue sky and rays of sunlight were beginning to force their way through the clouds. I was smiling at the sight when @CAPS2 brought up the subject of chocolate. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS1's your money!"" I exclaimed, biting my lower lip and looking down at my feet. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS1's my money. So what do you think? Want some chocolate?"" ""@CAPS5... sure, why not?"" I mumbled with a smile at the corners of my lips, and we headed back through the gardens. Things were more relaxed then. We laughed nonstop as we talked about things that weren't so serious, such as how clumsy we are @CAPS3 yet are still able to maintain being 'ninjas'. To this day, we have been together for fifty-six days, and our relationship is strong.  How is @CAPS1 possible? Well, despite our horrific pasts, the element of laughter that sneaks its way through into our moments together is what seems to be the thing that holds us together, even when the world turns its back on us. And to be sincerely honest, I hope @CAPS1 keeps a tight grip on us for years to come.",41.0,7.0
8," Everybody laughs, its a way of life, there are times when people laugh at the right moments @CAPS5 they sometimes laugh at the wrong moments @CAPS5 make someone they care about mad at them. Everyone has a different sense of humor, like me I have a twisted sense of humor, if you have ever watched the @CAPS1 series @CAPS5 thought that it was horrible, well I love those movies they are my favorite I don't know why but I just seem to like gore movies. I laugh at them because of how crazy the traps are @CAPS5 think its insane how smart the guy is. But that has nothing to do with the story that I am about to tell you. Well one day I was hanging out with my friends @CAPS5 @CAPS2 was @NUM1 days away @CAPS5 we all decided to go to the haunted corn maze in @LOCATION1. So the next day we all got together at about @NUM2 pm at my friend @PERSON2's house because his mom offered to drive us there so we all got into the car @CAPS5 left. About an hour or so later we pulled up to the corn maze, payed the entry fee @CAPS5 ran in. @CAPS5 before I go any further there is something I have to say about myself, I am very jumpy sometimes @CAPS5 when something jumps out my first instinct is to bring it down @CAPS5 run, now back to the story.  We went into the maze @CAPS5 we had to go through this little building thing @CAPS5 when we went in about @NUM3 people dressed in costumes like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @LOCATION2, @CAPS5 some other things I don't remember jumped out @CAPS5 scared everybody, @CAPS5 me @CAPS5 my friends all jump but my friend @PERSON2 screams @CAPS5 we all run deeper into the corn maze @CAPS5 when we were finally alone everyone turns around @CAPS5 looks at @PERSON2 @CAPS5 starts laughing really hard @CAPS5 @PERSON2 looks at me @CAPS5 says ""whats so funny!?"" @CAPS5 I said ""@CAPS6! You screamed like a little girl back there!"" @CAPS5 everybody starts laughing again @CAPS5 continues through the maze. So eventually we get to the halfway marker in the middle of the corn maze @CAPS5 there are @NUM4 port-a-potties lined up @CAPS5 my friend @PERSON1 says she has to go to the bathroom, so everyone stops @CAPS5 she starts walking towards it @CAPS5 when she is about @NUM4 feet from it a horn goes off @CAPS5 a pressure washer thing taped to the top of the port-a-potty soaks her, @CAPS5 while she is screaming @NUM1 guys with chainsaws (there is no chain on them) runs out from behind the port-a-potty's @CAPS5 starts chasing after everybody. So we run away @CAPS5 about @NUM7 minutes later we come to this tunnel that's painted pitch black on the walls so you cant see, with some of the fastest blinking strobe lights I have ever seen! While were standing outside of it some more people dressed in costumes with chainsaws jump out @CAPS5 we all run into the tunnel. Everybody finds there way out without any problems but me because while I was running inside it I accidentally ran into the wall @CAPS5 fell on my butt. So I get back up @CAPS5 find my way out. When I get out I see the end of the corn maze ahead through a tunnel that will make you lose your balance cause you walk along a platform @CAPS5 the tunnel is spinning around you. All my friends were already through so I start walking towards it then the guy dressed like a @CAPS3 clown jumps out of the corn behind me @CAPS5 sticks the chainsaw between my legs rev's it @CAPS5 pulls up so my feet are off the ground for a second. But when I touched down I immediately do a really quick @NUM8 @CAPS5 face the guy (@CAPS5 like I said earlier my first instinct is to bring them down) @CAPS5 kick him square in the balls @CAPS5 he falls forward @CAPS5 I reach down pick up the chainsaw @CAPS5 do the same thing he did to me to him.

8," Have you ever laughed so much and you can't stop laughing, but you have no idea why you can't stop? This happens to me all the time. Most of the people around me get annoyed, but sometimes they'll join in on my non-stop laughing spree. Thinking about laughing takes me back to one of the many nights that my laughter wouldn't stop. Seeing @ORGANIZATION1 sitting next to @CAPS1 giving me the evil eye that @CAPS3, on most cases, make me cower. This wasn't one of those times though, for I was on a laughing frenzy and there was no stopping me.  That night @PERSON1 came over to hang out and I had a great day so of course I was going to be in a great mood. @ORGANIZATION1, who was already annoyed that day, sat on the couch beside @CAPS1, her boyfriend, and talked about how annoying I am when @PERSON1's over since I can never stop laughing. @PERSON1 and I sat on the couch and talked about our days, how @PERSON2's laugh was starting to get on my last nerve. I imitated the loud laugh and made both of us burst into laughter. @ORGANIZATION1 looked over from the @ORGANIZATION2 and glared at me until the laughing died down a little bit.  Then the tickle war began, which I of course started. I unfortunately lost the war since he was able to have tickled my feet, the most ticklish spot I have. I rolled around on the couch laughing, my eyes watered a little, when I crashed onto the living room floor. @PERSON3, our dog, stood up from where @CAPS4 was laying and jumped on me. I squirmed on the ground laughing as @CAPS4 tried to lick my face and @PERSON1 tickled my feet. ""@CAPS3 you just shut up @PERSON4!"" @ORGANIZATION1 yelled, obviously annoyed with my laughing.  I picked @PERSON3's toy up and threw it across the room, @CAPS4 ran after it, so I had enough time to hop back up on the couch. I put my face down on the couch and giggled into the cushion so that @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 calm down. After ten minutes of giggling I decided I wanted a chocolate cupcake to feed my hungry stomach. I grabbed one out of the box and sat back down on the couch. When I sat down the chocolate shavings on top of the cupcake fell off and down my shirt. @PERSON1 laughed at me and looked at me like I was crazy which made me laugh even more. I took the cupcake and smeared the chocolate frosting all over his face. I laughed for a moment then he took the frosting that was smeared on his face and wiped it on mine. I sat on the couch laughed and licked the frosting off my hands that I cleaned off my face.  He got his payback and tickled my ribs and I flopped onto the floor again. @PERSON3 ran from the backroom and jumped on me, @CAPS4 tried to lick my face but I kept it covered from her slobber. After a moment of no tickling I crawled back up on the couch and giggled in the cushions for another half hour. @PERSON1 gave me the look as if I was crazy since there was no reason for me to have been laughing. @ORGANIZATION1 glared at me even more but I just laughed more. I stood up to go get my drink from the table, but I was quickly on the ground again when I tripped on a pillow. I burst into laughter all over again, I rolled around on the ground for five minutes. ""@PERSON4, @CAPS3 you stop acting like a ditz and be normal instead of putting on this stupid act since your boyfriend's over!"" @ORGANIZATION1 yelled from the kitchen.  I stopped laughing, rolled over and looked her directly in the eyes. With playful anger and giggling I said to her, ""shut up and stop being so mean @ORGANIZATION1."" I smiled and stood up from the living room floor. @ORGANIZATION1's eyes burned into the back of my head as I hopped back onto the couch beside @LOCATION1. ""@CAPS4's just jealous,"" he said with a smile. I laughed but stopped and tried not to annoy @ORGANIZATION1 for the rest of the night. @CAPS4 decided to go to @CAPS1's house so that @CAPS4 wouldn't have to listen to me laugh for another second, which worked for me so I could laugh all I wanted without her glaring at me. The rest of the night was peaceful. We sat and talked and laughed about our day. There was another tickle war which I finally won, I still laughed uncontrollably. I can't not laugh when I'm with my friends, it's impossible to do. I'll never forget the laughs and good times I have with anyone, laughter brings joy and happiness to me and always will.

8," When younger adults tell kids that the more you laugh the longer you will live or that it will add @NUM1 years on to your life time. Is this true? I personally live by the aspect of laughter. Making people laugh has gotten me many great friends even best friends, maybe even a few boyfriends. Any relationship no matter weather its just friendly or you like the person is brought together through laughter. Meaning that laughter can always ease some tension between two people or even a group of people. When I first started school I used laughter to make new friends, and to get them to like me. When I was in kinder-garden I was on the bus with a girl named @PERSON1 and I wanted to say something to her but I wasn't sure what to say so I decided to go with a joke. Of course it made her laugh then her laughing made me laugh. We laughed until one of us got off the bus, it happened to be her that got off the bus first. She was still laughing when she stepped off the bus. I wondered if that would be the only time we would talk. Little did I know it was the start of a great friendship. When I got home I told my mom all about what happened and then she asked if I met any new friends at school. I told her all about what happened on the bus and she told me that with my jokes she would be surprised if I didn't have a million friends by the end of the week.  The very next day when I got on the bus guess who I saw, @PERSON1, sitting there smiling and waving to me to come sit with her, so I went and sat down next to her. She asked me to tell her that joke I told her yesterday. I then told her the joke then she told me one of her jokes, we laughed tell we got to school. That whole day we were inseparable. We sat next to each other at story time and at snack time and then again on the bus ride home. It turned out it wasn't just that day we would be inseparable it was the whole school year and that whole @DATE1 fallowing that we were like two peas in a pod. When the next school year rolled around we found out we weren't in the same class any more and we only got to hang out on the bus and at recess cause we were in the first grade and we got recess then. For the next few years it would be this way where we only got to hang out while on the bus or out on the play ground. After a few years our bus routs changed and we then no longer rode the same bus but we still knew we were best friends cause we still had that best friend bond. On special weekends if we were lucky and good little girls our parents would let us go to each others houses to play and hang out, we would usually talk them into letting us stay the night too. We had many more funny moments, more then I can describe.  Once we got to middle school we hung out more and had the same friends, we even participated in the same activities such as band and sports. During those last few years tell high school we were close again. Us being the two goof balls that we are made a few more friends that liked the same sports and actives we did and thought the same jokes were funny that we thought were funny. We would all get together after a sporting even and talk about what happened during the game and laugh about the funny things that happened to us or the other team and maybe crack a few jokes about someone on the other team, you know girls just being girls. Activities like this went on tell right before high school started. Since high school started @PERSON1 and I still keep in touch, we have had a few classes together here and there but not a whole lot.  Hanna and I are still friends to this day and it wouldn't have been for that day on the bus where I decided to crack a joke and make her laugh for us to become friends. People usually say that it all started with a laugh or a joke. Laughter really can bring two people together, weather you stay friends for a long time or just a year, you can always recall how you met that person. I can actually say that I have made almost all my friends through laughter. As far as laughter makes you live longer goes, who knows. I'm only a junior in high school and have many more years on me. Everyone says that they don't ever not see me laughing or smiling, so lets hope it helps you live longer.",36.0,6.0
8," ""Laughter is the best medicine."" is said on all sorts of occasions. Laughter has always been a huge part of my life, it's something that I feed on and that helps me through everyday. One of the greatest day of my life revolved around just laughter alone. It was the @DATE1 that I had to take my friend, @PERSON4's senior pictures.  It was @DATE2 @TIME1 and I had gotten a text from @PERSON4 who had asked me to take her senior pictures, so I agreed and invited two of my friends @PERSON1 and @LOCATION2. We all met up at my house and decided that we would take her pictures the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  The ride was long, but certainly not boring. It was hysterical. We were laughing and joking about almost anything for no reason. When we finally reached @CAPS1 @CAPS2, it was raining, so we decided to take fun pictures instead. The pictures were hilarious and you could tell we were having tons of fun.  When we were soaked from the rain we decided to leave, but we didn't want the day to end, so we came up with the most fun, entertaining plan ever: to scare our other friends at their movie party. But for this, we needed an expert. Our friend @PERSON2.  Our plan was simple: get @CAPS5 @CAPS6, wait til dark, dress in black, scare the poop out of our friends, and also get a person on the inside. And since the party was at @ORGANIZATION1's house, we decided to let her in on it.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's house at around @TIME2, so it was really dark. We turned off the headlights to @PERSON4's car so that no one could see that we were coming and pulled halfway down @ORGANIZATION1's driveway. We stealth-mode crawled the rest of the way laughing the entire time.  We decided that first: I would call them @NUM1 or @NUM2 times and when they answered I would hang up. And on the @NUM3 time I would say, ""We're watching you."", after that we decided to make three groups: @PERSON4 and @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2, and me by myself. @PERSON4 and @LOCATION2 would sneak around one side of the house and @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 would sneak around the other side. Their plans were to scratch and pound on the windows and I would run around the back and open the sliding glass door and scare all of them.  The plan worked perfectly, they were all so scared from the phone calls and the scratching and pounding that when I ran through the sliding glass door, they scattered. Kiera ran to the bathroom and refused to let @CAPS7 in and @PERSON3 ran to @LOCATION1's bedroom, while @PERSON5 was uncontrollably laughing because she knew about everything.  After that everyone came in the house and we all laughed and joked for the rest of the night about how 'epic' and 'hilarious' our day had been. ",37.0,6.0
8,"Remembering all the great times my friends and I had brought much laughter. @PERSON2 and I met in kindergarden. I walked into my new classroom frightfully, clinging to my moms side. I sat down by a very shy girl. Her named just happened to be @PERSON2. I glanced at her and caught her eye. She said hello to me. That's where it all began. One day, @PERSON2 and I walked into the classroom together to start the new day of school. Our teacher had assigned us a project that had to do with glue. We sat down next to a girl named @LOCATION1. She was a short, light brown hair girl, who we thought was a little strange. During the time we were working on our project, we tried to talk to @LOCATION1, but instead of her talking to us, she swiftly picked up a glue stick, took of the cap, and started eating it. The room went silent and @PERSON2 and I burst into laughter. Third grade came around, and @PERSON2 and I were still bestfriends. We were getting older, and in our minds, more mature. We started hanging out with different people, and playing seperate games at recess, making not much time for eachother. We missed eachother, so I told her we needed to stay close because I wanted her to be my bestfriend for life. She was truely the best friend I had could have ever asked for. I remember one day at recess, when @PERSON2 was hanging out with a different set of friends then I. My friends and I were playing four sqaure. @PERSON2 got mad at me for not playing with her, and that was our first fight. I didn't understand why she was so mad about not playing, because she could have waited her turn in line. I went home and cried to my mom. She told me not to worry, because we were such good friends that nothing, not even a little fight, could make us no longer friends. The next day, she came up to me and said she was sorry. We hugged and started to laugh. @PERSON2 was truley, my best friend. Sixth grade hit. And we were still good friends. We picked all the same classes to be into together. We had @CAPS1.E and band. @PERSON2 and I chose to pick the clarinet to play. A very challenging looking insrument to play. We went to the meeting together, to rent our clarients from @ORGANIZATION1. Our band teacher was @PERSON1. After getting our new instrument, we went to band class the next day, to learn how they work. At first they were extremely difficult to play, and we began to get frustrated. No one understood how badly we wanted to be the best clarinet player in class. @PERSON1 also began to get frustrated, with @PERSON2 and I. We never really listened to him, and that's probably the reason we were not so good at the clarinet. After awhile, @PERSON1 decided to seperate @PERSON2 and I, and he put us on seperate sides of the room. Oh how we did not like that. We still would pass notes and talk in class, not really caring what the teacher said. Finally he put us back next to eachother. We started to get really good at playing.

Any case i know it's hard for me. In my mind, there is nothing better then making her laugh. I think that's why i strive so hard to make make her laugh. When I finally get that laugh that i was looking for. It makes me feel very accomplished. I do believe that laughter brings people together. I also believe that laughter will strengthen any relationship you might have. In my mind the reason why it helps in a relationship so @TIME1 is because, without laughter the relationship would be dull and boring. You need to be able to make each other laugh. plus when you have laughter in a relationship it will bring the two people together. They will have inside jokes that only they know about. That right there will brings them closer together, because its something only them share. I can name one instance were laughter brought me and a girl closer. This girl lives right down the street from me and one @TIME1 me and my friend went down to her house to hang out with her and her friend. Me and the girl talked pretty @TIME1 the whole @TIME1. We laughed so @TIME1, and now we have memories that only me and her share. That @TIME1 we became best friends because of all the things that we had in common.

Laughter is an important element in .life because it makes people be happy, excited, etc. Me and my friends always laugh and makes jokes, but when we dont its like theres no point in even talking, its very hard to explain.  One time me and one of my friends were arguing about something that was very pointless, but anyways, we started to make up jokes and laugh and our problem was pretty much solved even though when we really thought about it , it wasnt. Me and my friends argue about random things all the time, or are mad at eachother for something but to solve our problems we laugh and start thinking about something funny because if we were still arguing it wouldnt really go anywhere. For example it wouldnt solve our situation. And its true when people say that laughter is an important part of any relationship because if there wasnt laughter in your relationships then you would be serious all the time and it wouldnt come out as a good relationship. Theres times when me and my mom argue, like its not a really big problem, but when i laugh it off and start making jokes, we get along more, its a way of our relationship to work. I dont mean that whenever theres a problem in your life you always have to laugh it off and just forget about it but when your always serious about everything it doesnt always come out good, or makes everything better.  When me and my friends joke around we dont always joke to the point that its get out of control, but to the point that both of us can relate to things and be happy.

When @PERSON1 and I were first becoming best friends we found a saying that stated ""the more you laugh, the longer you'll live."" @CAPS1 that saying is true then @PERSON1 and I will live to be very old continuing being happy and making our friendship even stronger than it is now. We have had many times where we have laughed so hard we cried but i will never forget, even when I'm @NUM1 years old, when @PERSON1 and I both fell on our butts within one hour. It all began when @PERSON1 and I were walking to my house for lunch on a cold @DATE1 day. The high school stairs were all frozen over, they were like a sheet of ice. Arms locked, legs shaking, @PERSON1 and I slowly started walking down the eight flight of stairs. Halfway down the stairs we got overly confident and we let go of each other thinking that nothing bad was going to happen. When we got to the steepest flight of stairs, the last flight, @PERSON1 took a step and her feet slipped out from under her and she slid down the frozen stairs like a little kid sliding down a water slide. Laughing, worrying, and running, I hurried to the bottom of the stairs, where @PERSON1 had landed, to see @CAPS1 she was okay. @PERSON1, embarrassed and terrified, was laughing so hard she was crying. She jumped up like a @DATE2, she was more worried that people saw her than she was about being hurt. Luckily no one was near and she wasn't hurt a bit. We laughed for @NUM2 minutes straight with tears running down our cold, red faces.  When we safely got back up to the school, after eating lunch at my house, I started telling everyone what happened. After the lunch bell rang we headed to our fifth period class which was gym class, karma came at the wrong time. Our whole class was working out together, we were doing yoga. We each had our yoga mats on the ground scattered everywhere. To warm up we had to do @NUM3 jumping jacks and ten push ups, I made a blunder. I got up to do my @NUM3 jumping jacks and i didn't realize my mat was right next to me. On my seventh jumping jack my right foot stepped on my mat and the mat starting sliding away from me. With my foot stuck on the mat I couldn't do anything about it, i ended up doing the splits and falling on my butt in front of the whole class. Immediately everyone started laughing at me, @PERSON1 was laughing so hard she ended up on the floor with me. Once again, @PERSON1 and I laughed for another @NUM2 minutes straight. We definitely got a workout that day, because we were laughing so hard our abs started to extremely hurt. From that day on, I have realized that there is such thing as karma. I learned my lesson, I will never laugh or make fun of someone for falling ever again. Even though @PERSON1 and I both mortified ourselves that day, we will never forget that memory we had together. To me, laughter is the medicine to life. Laughing has caused my best friend and I to become so much closer and has made us realize that being unhappy gets you nowhere but being happy gets you anywhere. I'm so excited to grow old with @PERSON1 and to be able to continuously laugh and have many more unforgettable memories.",42.0,7.0

Her name is @CAPS1, she is the most beautiful girl iv ever meet. she is my world right now. I would do anything for this girl, and she would do anything for me. Our whole relationship is based on love, laughter, and more love. It seems to me that we never are in a bad mood when we are with each other, never sad always happy. When me and @CAPS1 first met it was not on very good terms. She was best friends with my ex girl friend and my ex girl friend didn't like me to much. I was at a school dance when i first saw her, she was absolutely beautiful in her blue dress and i stared at her for about @NUM1 minutes when she finally looked at me. she had this look of sadness on her face and i didn't really understand it. later that night i got the courage to go and ask her to dance and she said yes! We danced for the rest of the night because i guess we had this good connection. @CAPS1 and i have always had a connection from then on. After the dance i did not want to leave this girl because i feared i would never get to talk to her again so i asked for her number. She said yes and she had a great time, witch made me very happy because she was not sad anymore. Later that week i would try talking to her in the halls at school and for some reason couldn't get her to engage in a conversation. So i decided to call her on @DATE2 to ask her on a date. she told me no and that i should stop bothering her because her best friend hates me and that wouldn't be very good for there relationship. Finally after hours of talking on the phone i asked her to not tell anyone about our dater we were going to have on @DATE1. She said yes and that made me the happiest guy on earth. I was walking around my house with my new found swagger because i had a date on @DATE1 with the girl of my dreams. On @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS1 and i whet bowling at the bowling ally in town. we where both very bad and it was funny watching her bowl. She is not a very strong girl, and watching her try to bowl was very funny. We both laughed for hours that night. Me and her were so happy, i told her we could do this every night and that i would make her the happiest girl ever. @CAPS1 and I proceeded to have these secret dates that where better then anything iv experienced before. Iv slowly started to think we were in a relationship beyond friendship. On the last secret date we had, @CAPS1 asked me the question that i will remember for the rest of my life. Will you be my boy friend?' I was ecstatic, yelling yes, yes! god yes! She was very happy happy as well. I could now go to school and hold this beautiful girls hand and go over to her place and meet her family and start our new relationship. We are now currently still in love and moving very slow. we are hoping to make good decisions after high school and stay together. I think one of the main reasons why me and @CAPS1 got along so well on our dates was the laughter. She can make me laugh at anytime of the day and always cheer me up. I don't know what i would do without her. ",38.0,6.0

Being in some of these positions I can understand why laughter is so important. A great example would be when I went to @LOCATION3 in the @DATE1. I did things, met people, and achieved some personal goals that I wanted to accomplish, and couldn't have done it without laughing and remembering why I was there. Going to @LOCATION3 was a trip of a lifetime for me and it was one that I will never forget. I will never forget the foods that I tried, the friends I met, and some of the fears that I overcame. The first day we arrived in @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1, I told myself that I wasn't going to turn down any opportunities to try new foods, and this applied to the time I was going to spend in @LOCATION5 as well. I was a little nervous to tell you the truth, but I'm glad that I stuck with my goal. That afternoon, we all went out to do some walking around and shopping. My mom was inside of a restaurant with my coach and some of the other parents. I had to get money from her to buy a gift for my little sister that I thought would bring a piece of @LOCATION4 home with me. So I went inside to ask her, but my coach told me that I had to try what he was eating before I could have the money. I thought, opportunity!I asked what he was eating and he told me that it was @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 and that it was so amazing. He gave me a bite that had a little bit of everything on it. As soon as I had the @CAPS1 in my mouth, I wanted to spit it right back out. After I painfully swallowed the bite, I had a look on my face that made it clear to everyone that I did not acquire a taste for @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1. All the parents laughed and my coach laughed the most. I could not help but laugh myself because I could only imagine the look on my face when I first discovered that the @ORGANIZATION1's @CAPS1 was really @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @CAPS1. While we were in @LOCATION4, we played a friendly soccer match against one of @LOCATION4's home teams. It was our first game of our trip and everyone was really excited. We wanted not only to play soccer, but to meet new people from another country that we had something in common with, and that was our passion for soccer. The match ended with a score of six to one, our team coming out on top with a victory. Of course we wanted to win, but that wasn't our priority. We wanted to have fun. After we shook hands with the other players, we wanted to exchange pendants and t-shirts so that they would never forget the team that came from @LOCATION2. We were all happy and you could tell that we were having the time of our lives. Everyone stayed on the field just talking to them and messing around with each other., taking pictures, and playing a few fun soccer games that they thought us. Some of our girls showed off their @CAPS7 accents, and girls from the @LOCATION4 team tried out their ""@CAPS8 voices"", so they call it. They would say some pretty insane things that they thought were phrases we said on a regular basis. None of us could stop laughing because of their poor imitations. They kept yelling, ""yeah snowboarding!"" I really didn't know why exactly, but I guess to them it was something we said all the time. We stayed and talked to them for hours until it was dark. At the @TIME1, we all exchanged @CAPS9 names and also a few numbers. Throughout the match and the socializing, there was nonstop laughter. We never wanted them to forget us, but I think it is safe to say that we never forgot them either.  Over the time I spent in @LOCATION3, I had done some things that I never thought that I would do. Like go on the @LOCATION4 @CAPS10 because of my fear of heights, or even have gotten on the plane for that matter.Throughout all of the found-raising, interesting meals, and moments that I didn't think I was going to get through, laughter was one of the only things that got me through the trip. It didn't just make me feel better, but it allowed me to just let go and realize that the chances of me going again and having the same experiences was very little. I'm great-full for all of my friends, the ones I came with and the ones I had gained in the @TIME1, that made this trip one that I will never forget and most of all the trip of a lifetime.

8," Throughout a person's life there @CAPS4 plenty of embarrassing moments. Let's face it; sometimes things just happen that you have no control over. That's why when I forgot my lines in our middle school production ofThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON3, I felt like dying. In my opinion, the ability of being able to laugh at yourself is one of the best qualities a person can have. Even if the whole country is laughing at you (or the entire seventh grade class, in my case) if you can laugh along with them it makes everything seem so much better. Being a teenage girl, not only do embarrassing events happen what feels like daily, but at this age these things seem to matter so much more. Because of reputations and the prospect of popularity always looming over you, a simple trip, misspoken word, or stain on your jacket seems like the end of the world. Sometimes, if you're lucky, these things can happen in the privacy of your on home, but other times your mistakes happen on display for everyone to see, making the possibility of forgetting it ever happened impossible. If you would have asked me at the time, I would've told you seventh grade was perfect; classes were easy, I had the best friends, and life just seemed to be going my way. That was, of course, before musical theater. It was almost @DATE1 and with the sun shining outside our classroom window the end-of-year excitement was already fully visible. I was in @PERSON1's classroom, the walls decorated with their usual choir theme, surrounded by the best class a person could imagine. We were practicing our play we planned on presenting the very next day, and at the moment I wasn't nervous at all, and maybe that was my first mistake, but if I'm honest with myself the play didn't seem like too big of a deal, and surrounded by my friends how could anything go wrong? That was @CAPS5 a bad move on my part. The day had finally arrived and we were going to be presenting the musical we had all worked so hard on. With everyone dressed in costume and with full makeup on the jitters had seemed to finally move in. ""@CAPS4 you nervous?"" One of my best friends, @PERSON2 asked me. She was playing one of the leads in the play and I knew just how excited she was. I figured I should try to play it cool. ""Of course not, no big deal right? @CAPS4 you?"" I didn't know how she could possibly not be nervous, looking out I saw that the auditorium was full of students and parents there to see us. ""@CAPS5 not! I better go though now, I think were starting."" @PERSON2 responded. Well that settled it then; if @PERSON2 (who's part was practically triple the lines of mine and who had an entire song to herself) wasn't nervous, then I @CAPS5 had no right to be.  As the curtain slowly opened and the spotlight flashed on I prepared myself for the opening song to begin playing; my cue to @MONTH1 on stage with the rest of the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. I took my first step on stage and suddenly it seemed as if all my lines had left me with just one clap of hands from the audience. I knew I had a one-line solo coming up but I couldn't remember it! With every measure of the music I could feel the moment nearing but I still couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. Then suddenly, it was my turn.  The audience obviously recognized the error in the performance and as I stood on stage I could feel my cheeks reddening. I heard the giggles from my fellow classmates in the audience and it only proceeded to get worse. I would have given anything to not be on that stage right then and instead be sitting with them, but there was nothing I could do about it and I had to move on.  As the first act ended and I got to exit the stage I was finally able to take a deep breath.  Looking at the wall (where our teacher had conveniently posted the script) I read over my lines. I knew this! Every blocking movement and gasp for dramatic effect was lodged in my brain and it seemed impossible that I could forget it once I had walked out on stage. Taking one last moment to look over my lines I walked back out on stage, confident that this time I would not forget my lines. Although to this day when I think of that moment, when I stood on that stage and everyone expectantly waited for my lines, the embarrassment is still palpable I know it's all okay. Because of the ability of being able to laugh at myself I was able to get over that moment. Even though I @DATE1 never forget, who else is going to remember some little mistake that happened during our seventh grade play?",37.0,6.0
8,"                    My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we sit in the cool locker room my face flushes to a light pale color. I turn to my friend @PERSON1 @CAPS3 she puts on her make up. We all rush to put our hair up the way we planned.i take out my phone to check the time once my face regains color I gasp were late! @CAPS3 our coach runs in and yells for us to get to the field. we sprint down to the field and the @CAPS2 has already started. I through down my bag and so do the others. We rush @CAPS3 fast @CAPS3 we can to get into our stag. @CAPS3 we stand by the field a gush of wind glides over my bare legs. I shiver in my place @CAPS3 we hurry to find a cheer. When we have found a cheer we all agree on, I'm very stressed. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 calls the cheer i put on a smile and begin to cheer. @CAPS3 we hit the moves my mind suddenly goes blank I can't remember the moves. My face goes stiff @CAPS3 i quickly begin to clasp my hands together. I look over and see almost half the squad confused. I continue to clasp then feel a sharp pain because of how hard i was slamming them together. Once the cheer ends I quickly spirit to the crowd and whip myself around and relax my face. @CAPS3 our coach begins to speak to us we all turn our heads to look at her. She tells us we have to stunt before half time. I glance at the giant clock holding the score, there is only five minutes left in this half of the @CAPS2. I turn to @PERSON1 she nods at me and we begin to spirit to our places so we can stunt. @CAPS3 we are moving into our places the cold winds chills my body. When we set, one foot is handed into @ORGANIZATION1's hand and the other about to jump into mine. I hear the counts that are so familiar to me. @CAPS3 the cold pattern of her shoe slams my hands we push her into a prep. We begin to say the cheer @CAPS3 her foot begins to slide from under my hands. I look and see the same thing is happening to @PERSON1. A flash of fear hits my face @CAPS3 she falls out of our hands. A gasp slips from my lips @CAPS3 her hands brace her fall. Our whole stunt group hurries to pull her up when i notice her back moving up and down rapidly. I assume she is crying, but when we scoop her up she is laughing like crazy. @PERSON1 and I give a confused look to one another and ask her if she is @CAPS4. She states that she is fine and we get back into our stag. Once @CAPS5 calms down @PERSON1 passes down a cheer. When the cheer is passed half way down the line one of the girls changes the cheer. I turn to her and say ""that's not the cheer!"" We all argue about the cheer until our coach yells a cheer to do. Once we finish our cheer I see one of the players running with the ball. I scream at him to run harder! When he is tackled i slam my foot down on the track field and let our a grunting noise. Everyone on the squad looks at me and we all burst our laughing. Once we calm down and wipe the warm tears from our eyes, we turn to the score board and notice we only have two minutes left in the @CAPS2. Realizing our situation our coach through a cheer for us to do. We quickly turn and do our cheer @CAPS3 the buzzer goes off. We clean and spirit once the cheer is over and we turn to the field. I glance at the score board and see that we have lost. We all start to make fun of our @CAPS2 and what happened when we messed up. We all laugh about the cheers and joke about when we didn't know them. Our @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was nerve racking but it was a lot of fun!",35.0,6.0
8," My uncle and I have a great friendship. We are able to joke and get along well. I believe the key to our friendship is our ability to laugh. The element of laughter is paramount in our relationship because it has allowed us to overcome any misunderstandings and grow into great friends.  Growing up on opposite sides of the @LOCATION1, my uncle and I have had difficulties understanding each other. A native to the @LOCATION3, my uncle is versed in both @CAPS1 and @CAPS2. Even though he is skilled in @CAPS1, I am still challenged to understand him. Likewise, having grown up in @LOCATION4, I have a larger @CAPS1 vocabulary, which at times can be confusing for him. Along with the language barrier, my uncle is thirty eight years old. I only being seventeen presented us with a difference in maturity.  This @DATE1 was my first time to meet my uncle. Leaving for five to ten year work contracts in @LOCATION2, my uncle and I were only able to talk on the phone. From what I had heard, I knew my uncle was a nice guy, but it is hard to know someone just through the telephone. When I first arrived in the @LOCATION3, I was somewhat hesitant to speak with my uncle. As the days passed, my uncle and I were able to create a strong bond through our ability to joke with each other. Our jokes weren't elaborate and instead consisted of constant teasing. Being larger and I believe stronger than my uncle, we constantly joked about our strength. Along with teasing, my uncle and I competed in feats of strength. From arm wrestling to push up competitions, my uncle and I would constantly joke about who was stronger. When it came time to go back to @LOCATION4, I was very sad to be leaving my uncle. The time we had spent with each other was great because of the element of laughter.  From the time I spent with my uncle, I believe the language and maturity void between my uncle and I was filled with laughter. Though barriers of language and maturity came between our friendship, these barriers were overcame by the element of laughter. My uncle and I love to laugh and for this reason, we have a great friendship.",38.0,6.0
8," Everyone has had a best friend at some point. Mine is named @PERSON1, @CAPS8 has dark brown hair and the greatest smile in the world. My best friend and I are quite an odd couple. The things we talk about and the adventures we have are not exactly what you would call normal. The two of us have shared some of my favorite memories, been through some of the toughest times, and laughed a lot.  @PERSON1 and I have a lot of differences. @CAPS8 likes to act tough and is a germaphobe. I on the other hand am pretty girly and am not too worried if someone drinks out of my glass. There is one thing that we both absolutely love though. @CAPS1. Everything about @CAPS7 just makes us giddy. We love the lights and the smell of the @CAPS1 tree, the music, everything. So what are two eager girls to do in the middle of @DATE1 with no plans? Well, have a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of course, what else? We had @CAPS7 all planned out. We would put the lights up, frost cookies, watchElf, drink hot chocolate and run around in our long johns. Sounds like a movie, right? When I arrived the @CAPS2 of, I walked through the door and was enveloped in the inviting smell of pine, the glow of assorted colors of lights and, the warmth of my best friend's tight embrace. We got right to work. We started by putting the lights on the roof, then moved on to trying to wrestle the tree to sit straight in the stand (I was the one under the tree while @PERSON1 told me which way to adjust, of course) then, we got to making @PERSON1's famous sugar cookies. After adding all of the necessary ingredients we sprinkled flour over the table and started cutting the dough in to miniature santa's and @CAPS1 tree's. Then the war began. @PERSON1 scooped a fingertip of flower and said, ""@CAPS4 @PERSON2,"" ""@CAPS5-,"" I began but was stopped short because as I lifted my head, my nose had collided with with her fingertip making my eyes cross as I watched the puff of white powder protrude from my nose like a miniscule nuclear explosion. I grabbed a palm-full of flour and wiped @CAPS7 down her cheek giving a triumphant ""@CAPS6!"" In turn @CAPS8 grabbed a hearty fist-full and threw @CAPS7 in my face. We spent quite a while giggling and dodging each others attempts to cover one another in the stuff. With our tummy's sore and our eye's wet from laughter we started frosting cookies along with her family members who were slowly but surely arriving at the house. Once all of the cookies had been frosted and strewn around the kitchen to dry we popped in the movieElf and got settled in, surrounded by all of our loved ones. As the movie was coming to @CAPS7's conclusion, our eyelids drooped and a warmth filled our belly's from the cider her mom had made. I was on the verge of sleep, blinking slower everytime, and I saw a fluttering outside the window. Not able to control my curiosity, I groggily stumbled over to the window sill, pushed the curtains aside then turned to @PERSON1 with a giddy grin and whispered, ""@CAPS7's snowing!"" @CAPS8 immediately jumped up to look out the window, we looked at one other, screamed, then sprinted for the front door. Once outside we grabbed each other and jumped up and down in excitement. Then we were silent. Watching the snow flutter and spiral through the brisk winter air, both in utter agreement to the words that did not need to be spoken. We had just been gifted with a perfect ending to a perfect @CAPS2.",39.0,6.0
8,"     I watched in anticipation as @CAPS7 @CAPS1 used a shovel to scoop his dog's poop, everyone in the family did. This was getting to be the best joke yet, and the only person not in on @CAPS12 was @CAPS7 @PERSON1 @PERSON1. Currently, she was in the house, cooking or doing something else that was delaying our trick. @CAPS6 finished up, and leaned the shovel against the house. He sat down in his lawn chair, and we all waited until poor @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moseyed outside on her own terms. @CAPS7 @CAPS2 laid the bait, ""@CAPS3 @PERSON1, I'll give @CAPS4 five bucks to lick that shovel""     @CAPS4 see, @CAPS7 @PERSON1 @PERSON1 is not one to pass up some easy money. She agreed wholeheartedly, and picked up the shovel. She turned the pole side down, stuck her tongue out, and just barley skimmed @CAPS12 along the tip of the blade. We all burst into laughter. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 looked genuinely confused, which only made us laugh harder.Someone finally managed to sputter out, ""@CAPS4-@CAPS4 know @CAPS6 just scooped dog poop with that shovel?""     @CAPS7 stomach began to hurt, but the joke only got better. Between snorts @CAPS7 @CAPS2 sweetened the deal, ""I'll give @CAPS4 five more bucks to kiss your husband."" @CAPS9 @PERSON2 did not stick around to see if his wife would make good on the deal, which we all knew she would. I had never seen @CAPS7 @CAPS9 run so fast in @CAPS7 life, and @PERSON1 @PERSON1 was right on his heels. To our amusement, @PERSON1 chased him around awhile, until he just couldn't run anymore and he got down on the ground in the fetal position, refusing to move until @PERSON1 @PERSON1 thoroughly washed her mouth out. Pouting, she went inside. The rest of us continued to loiter the backyard, still giggling at our success on pulling one over on @PERSON1 @PERSON1. About five minutes later, she came back out from the house. Still pouting, she went straight over to her husband, looking innocent, and laid a big one right on his kisser. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 then turned to @CAPS7 @CAPS2, ""I didn't brush @CAPS7 teeth. @CAPS4 owe me ten bucks""    The hysterical laughter started all over again. @CAPS9 @PERSON2 started gagging, while @CAPS7 @CAPS2 gladly got his wallet out, and offered @CAPS7 grinning @PERSON1 @PERSON1 her winnings.    To this day at family gatherings, nearly all one has to say is 'shovel' and the teasing and giggles start. Poor @PERSON1 @PERSON1 always takes @CAPS12 with a brave face, joking along with us. She always says, ""@CAPS12 takes the sting out of a sick joke, when @CAPS4 can laugh along with the jokers.""

8,"@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 once said, Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I couldn't agree with them more. Anybody can speak with one another, or even become friends, but laughter is the glue that holds their relationship together. It's such a simple, innocent, action, that can create a lifetime of @CAPS2 between two people. It was @CAPS7 first day of, yet another, new @CAPS5. I was starting to lose count. What was this, the seventh one? Yeah, that seemed about right. This time it was different, though. I wasn't just a little kid anymore with one classroom to sit in all day. Not only was it @CAPS7 first day at a new @CAPS5, it was @CAPS7 first day of @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Where you used binders instead of notebooks. Where you didn't sit in the same desk all day. Where you had a schedule that you had to memorize, and a locker combination as well. Where they only gave you four minutes to get to class on time. Plus, I was back at the bottom of the food chain, this time, with no friends. Nobody I could turn to in class to talk with. Nobody to share a laugh with at lunch. Not only did I not know anybody, I was a nobody.   I scurried into @CAPS7 first class of the day, homeroom. For the first time, I was hoping there was a seating chart so that I didn't have to awkwardly choose @CAPS3 to sit by. Thankfully, @CAPS3 out there thought I deserved a break, and there was. Everybody had cute little name tags planted on their desk with a @CAPS5 planner and a candy bar. I laughed. It seemed like kindergarten all over again, then I thought to myself: ""@CAPS6 this won't be so bad after all."" @CAPS7 eyes swept over all of the thirty-one desks in the room for @CAPS7 name. I found it, smack in the @CAPS4 of the classroom. Realizing I had been standing in the doorway for quite sometime, I quickly walked to @CAPS7 seat and sat down. Waiting for the rest of @CAPS7 classmates to arrive, anxiously anticipating to find out who @CAPS7 neighbors would be.   Finally, everybody was in class, and the bell rang. I glanced around the room. Taking everybody in. Judging them. Trying to figure out if any of them looked friendly enough for me to talk to. The people seemed fairly nice, but none of them looked like they would take their time to talk to the ""new girl"", let alone try to make friends with her. I was about to look behind me when the bell rang and the teacher stood up from his desk. He began to call roll, which gave me another opportunity to scrutinize @CAPS7 classmates. One by one he called everybody's name, making sure everybody was in their correct seats. Each name called was another new face for me. Still, nobody was quite catching @CAPS7 attention. Then he called out the name @PERSON1. I quickly scanned the room, trying to match a face to the name. Finally she replied ""here"", and I found her. Sitting in the desk diagonally behind me and to the right. She was casual. Wearing a hoodie from her youth group, a pair of jeans, and some tennis shoes. I knew right then, she was the one. She didn't just seem nice, but friendly as well. I quickly turned back to face the front of the classroom, delighted with @CAPS7 new discovery.  Homeroom was finally over and it was time to switch to out next class, @CAPS8. If I was going to strike up a conversation with @PERSON1, it was going to be now or never. I hastily walked up to her, trying to make it seem casual. I started to freak out, how was I going to start this? I decided on just a simple ""hi"". Thankfully, that was all it took. She turned to me with her imperfect smile, and said hello. We introduced each other and started talking about what we thought this new @CAPS5 was going to be like. We shared a few laughs over our teacher's thinning hair, and the few crazy stories he had already told us. She even invited me to sit by her in out next class. Throughout the course of the day, we slowly grew closer and opened up more. We spoke about our home lives. Laughed at immature jokes. We were getting in trouble for passing notes when we weren't supposed to, and even thinking about hanging out that weekend. I couldn't believe it, I went from being frightened fresh meat, in a new and scary place, to, well, still frightened fresh meat, but I had @CAPS3 by @CAPS7 side now. I had @CAPS3 to take it all in with me. @CAPS3 to turn and talk to in class. @CAPS3 to giggle with at lunch, in class, or even in the halls. I had a friend.  """,38.0,6.0
8," ""A day without laughter is like a day without sunshine"". When you were a kid you smiled at almost everything. When you were a teenager you smiled at somethings, but no as much as you used to when you were a little kid. Now when your an adult and are independent you don't smile much. Because there is so much stress and worry over things. Just a simple smile can change things for most if not all of us.  People consider a smile just as a daily routine, but when you think about it a smile can change someones life. If everyone just went about their day without taking a break or hearing a little joke to make you smile, the stressful days would probably get even more stressful and maybe boring. When there has been a devastating event that occurred some place in the world and they show some kids who are so sad, hungry, crying, and lonely one thing that we would all want to do is make each and everyone of those kids smile. If there was a commercial advertising toys, food, or even games to those kids probably fifty percent of us would donate or buy them.  When i was a kid, @CAPS1 in @LOCATION1 and going though some hard things if i could see at least one person who smiled at me when i was crying instead of making me cry even more than i was, i would have more confidence than i do now. Because there were so much stress everyone was under no body really cared to make anyone happy or even just smile. Everyone was busy thinking about their problems , "" what will i feed my children today"", "" how will we get buy without money"", "" will my children be hungry again"", @CAPS1 in a country where there is a shortage of food and people are dieing everyday because of it, its not everyday to see someone smiling and walking down the street. No matter what has happened in my life and no matter how many sadness i have faced and thank god am here right now smiling i will never forget about have of the world who are facing so much challenges. A smile has so much more meaning than it is shown. When you smile at someone it's like saying ""it's @CAPS2 you get through it"" or like saying "" good job"". Personally i thinks there should be a day when everyone smiles to someone else and that person should pass it to another. Because now days people are in stress and they forget the simplest things get in their way. I wish my great grandparents, who were crying everyday because of being worried what will happen next to their children and their grandchildren, i wish someone was there to give them a smile instead of a discouraging laugh, and told them its @CAPS2.  Laughter is an important element in life, i mean that's why they make comedy shows so people can just take a break and laugh at something that can make them have an easier day. I think laughter is key to a good life, because a day without laughter is a day without sunshine.",36.0,6.0
8," In my relationship laughter is very important. @PERSON2 my boyfriend of two years now, is my best friend and i have never once felt regret being with him. The fact that we can call me every morning and every night puts a smile on my face. @PERSON2 and I did meet @ORGANIZATION1 through my brother while playing a @CAPS1 called @ORGANIZATION1. Automatically I did hate him just because my first impression of him was everything negative. Every time we had to party up to level we ignored each other but if we did chat it was full of rude remarks, my favorite when he used to try and be mean to me was always ""@CAPS2 we should take the laptop out of the kitchen so @CAPS3 can focus on making me my sandwich @PERSON1.""  The fact that he always wanted superiority drove m crazy. After a while of knowing each other @ORGANIZATION1 and being at each others throats constantly my brother got upset and set up a landing party at our house. A landing party is when people bring over their computers to play games for hours upon hours and enjoy each others company. I of course was miserable to hear that @PERSON2 was coming to it. That night all of the guys from our guild came over but @PERSON2 was late, by the time he got to our house everyone had fallen asleep but me, of course at the time i did not even want to let him in but in the end I'm glad I did.That whole night we cracked jokes back and forth. As the night went on my face began o hurt from the endless laughs and smiles.""@CAPS3 know @PERSON1 I actually think your a amazing person."" @PERSON2 mumbled I almost missed it, thank goodness I did not.His words made me blush, I reached forward for his face and poked his cheek then right before i kissed him,""@CAPS3 tempt me way too much dork..."" left my mouth.The reason I am with @PERSON2 still to this day is because he makes me chuckle, giggle, crackle, roar, smile whatever @CAPS3 want to call it he is the only person who has this effect and that's why I am positive our relationship will stay strong until we die. Every night @PERSON2 calls me and tells me how much he does love me, I in return tell him how much I love him. I know we @MONTH1 not last forever but I enjoy the time we do have.",39.0,6.0
8," The fear of not being accepted by others is something that everyone feels at one point. Sometimes we experience @TIME1 feeling with such intensity that @CAPS2 causes our minds to slow down and our bodies to freeze in horror. When @TIME1 happens, @CAPS2 seems like there's nothing that you can do to rid yourself of @TIME1 paralyzed feeling. There are only a few things that can help you at that point. When I was in that situation, laughter was @CAPS3 got me through @CAPS2. ""@CAPS1?"" our perky director asked all of us much louder than necessary, as the room had been deathly silent for the past half hour. ""@CAPS2's almost time, so put your game faces on!,"" she continued. @TIME1 was the @TIME1 that our group of good friends and not so good friends had been working toward for the past seven weeks. Rehearsal after rehearsal of our comedy had gradually prepared us for @TIME1, when we would finally unveil our hard work. We had gone through many practices together, and after the gallons of blood, sweat, and tears we had put into them, @CAPS2 seemed like any small failure in the eyes of the crowd would bring humiliation to us all. ""@CAPS3 if the crowd doesn't like @CAPS2?"" ""@CAPS3 if we mess up?"" ""@CAPS3 do we do if no one laughs?"" were the type of questions that everyone grappled with at one point that @TIME1. I dismissed these worries quickly, believing that they had come on due to the intense nervousness that I felt, which which meant that I was in no condition to think logical thoughts. I had no idea just how justified my ideas were. Our little group was waiting in a back room, anxiously waiting our turn to perform while other groups were onstage. We had put our costumes on about an hour earlier, and with no other pressing matters to attend to, we all had no choice but to sit and battle with our nervousness. Some sort of game would have been a good idea, as @CAPS2 would have distracted everyone from their growing dread towards call time. No one thought of one. @CAPS2 seemed like their was no lifeline to save us from our fear of the crowds disapproval. So we thought. As the final play before ours was drawing to a close, we marched out to stand near the door to the stage. Parents came by to wish us good luck, but @CAPS2 did little to mitigate the tension. Wishing for luck would do nothing to actually get us some. A tangible promise for a flawless @TIME1 would have been the only thing that could have satisfied us. Of course, one didn't come, and we were sure that our performance would be far from flawless. Our morale was slowly disintegrating as the constant barrage of fear enveloped us. The next few minutes passed in a blur as we all got into position onstage with the curtain closed and proceeded to set up our scenery. As the final objects were being placed, our director gave us a re-assuring look. @CAPS2 was meant to be re-assuring, anyway. All that @CAPS2 really did was remind us that we would be on the stage without any adult help at all. Just as I was considering running off the stage, the curtain opened, and the opening scene began. Our lead actor was doing a fabulous job of with her lines, just as we had practiced. I was beginning to think that @TIME1 would turn out to be a fun @TIME1. Then, my mood took a turn for the worse after we had gone through the first five jokes without receiving so much as a giggle. Things were not looking good. Then, the unthinkable happened. As one of our actors was crossing the stage while talking, they tripped over someone's foot, then proceeding to face-plant on the floor with, seeming to imitate a tree being felled. She recovered quickly, but the damage had been done. We had failed. As @CAPS2 came time for my lines, all my resolve had disappeared. When @CAPS2 came time for my lines, suddenly, a foreign sound came from the crowd. Laughter. I looked to the back and made out one of my mother's friends, who had just arrived. More importantly, she was notorious for her extraordinarily loud laugh. @CAPS2 pierced deep into my conscious, and suddenly, @CAPS2 felt like I was revived. All of my worries had been dispelled by that sound. I delivered my final line with enough spirit that @CAPS2 seemed like I had enough to share with everyone. The other actors were revived by my forceful deliverance, and followed my example, greatly enhancing their lines. We finished our play with more strength then we had ever had during practice. The feeling was magical. Laughter is an important part of life. @CAPS2 is a display of your own happiness, but more importantly, @CAPS2 spreads happiness to others. Laughter is the best way to make our world a happier place. That should be the number one goal of everyone.",42.0,7.0

8," My dad always says, ""Laughter is the best medicine."" I never really thought about it, as far as i was concerned it was just some old saying that had nothing to @CAPS4 with my life. Then one day, I realized that laughter was ,and is, truly the best medicine.  Last @DATE1 i was having a terrible time. Constantly worrying about my junior year and the college courses I would be taking. I was working five days a week for seven to eight hours a day. My job was irritating and stressful, making me constantly on the edge of a break down. I never had much time for hanging out with my friends or going to the lake like most fifteen year old's @CAPS4; @CAPS3 my weekends were spent catching up on sleep and babysitting for my parents. I never got to stop and just take a deep breath to calm myself and my nerves; i was on the go non stop.  One day, after a long day at work, i came home to find my house a complete and utter disaster. @CAPS3 of asking me how my day was or trying to talk to me and make me feel better, my mother says, ""@CAPS1! Why haven't you done the dishes?"" or ""@CAPS1! Why is the front room a disaster? Clean it now."" @CAPS3 of reasoning with her or trying to tell her about my day, I blow up! I tell her how I never get a break and how ""horrible"" my life is going; that I never, ever get one second for myself. How I am exhausted all the time and I can never @CAPS4 anything right. I say, ""@CAPS4 the dishes yourself."" I storm out. As I am walking out of the place I call home, all I can think of is how incredibly wrong my mother is. Does she not know how hard I work everyday? Does she not realize how much stress I have in my life? Of course not! How could she? Okay, yes she does work. Okay, yes she never has time to hang out with her friends either. And fine, she has to come home from a hard days work only to realize her house is destroyed and she is the one who has to clean it. That is when it dawned on me, I am a whiner! How can I be the one complaining when, hello, my mother has it just as bad as I @CAPS4, and @CAPS3 of talking to her about it, and trying to reason, guess what I @CAPS4? Yell at her then make a grand exit. How immature.  I go back inside and find my mother sitting on the couch reading her book. She looks up at me and gives me the I-know-how-you-feel look. I immediately start crying, letting all of my frustration and irritation out of my system. My mom gives me a hug and kisses my forehead. I then realize, how incredibly pointless this whole entire scene was, and start laughing hysterically, and my mother laughs with me. We laugh for about ten minutes until we decide that enough is enough.  Even though after that, my mother and I never shared words we had a secret agreement: not to let the little things get to us. We continued on our days; working, cleaning, and anything else we needed to @CAPS4. Our little ""laughing fit"" help both of us realize that it is okay to have a break down here and there, but to remember that things are hard for everyone, and to just take a deep breath and continue on the race we all call life.",35.0,6.0
8," @DATE1 twentieth was a hot day, my family an I had decided that we wanted to go to the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 for my birthday, so I invited everyone I wanted to go, even my parents invited some people so they wouldn't be stuck with a bunch of sixteen and seventeen year old. At eight @CAPS1 we had packed five cars full of people and four ice coolers full of food to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and oh my gosh that day was so much fun, but it seemed like it took for ever but we kept our selves entertained @CAPS14 the way there. The night before my dad (@CAPS4) said that we are leaving at eight thirty @CAPS1 no matter what, and let me tell @CAPS9 when my dad says were leaving at a certain time we leave at that time and not a second later or we end up having to listen to him complain and yell about not leaving at the right time. Everyone went to bed early that night so we wouldn't have any problems in the morning getting up but of course I wake up to my little brother and my dad arguing because he doesn't want to get up and and he doesn't want to go, what a way to wake up for my birthday right? After all the fighting stopped my brother (little @CAPS4) got out of bed and got ready to go to the @CAPS3 and he helped put everything in the car. My dad decided he wanted to ride his motorcycle to the @CAPS3 so he called up some of his friends and said that he wanted to ride so they had to because he is the president of theFreebird motorcycle club and his @CAPS5 president said ""alright lets ride"" anyone in the club that was going had to ride there motorcycle or they had to pay @MONEY1 to the club because that is the club rule. At seven thirty all of my friends started showing up my dad didn't really understand @CAPS6 many people I had invited it was my sixteenth birthday I had to @CAPS10 a lot of people. He started getting frustrated and yelling saying ""@CAPS6 MANY @CAPS7 PEOPLE @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11!!!"" I said only like ten or eleven maybe twelve people its not that many dad. Well good thing for me only eight people showed up. I was sad but I was very happy that I didn't have to cram a bunch of people in our car and listen to my dad yell. At eight thirty we left my house headed to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  I had brought a lot of @CAPS12's to listen to because we had an hour and half long drive till we got to the @CAPS3, @CAPS14 one of my @CAPS12's I have this song its calledI'm @CAPS14 A @CAPS15 and there is a lot of cussing in this song, my mom turn's it up and starts singing to it all my friends started cracking up laughing because they are listening to a forty year old woman sing this song, I swear it's like she could have been our age at the time. Half way threw the song we all started singing and then we all laughed so hard that by the time we got to the @CAPS3 we all had to pee. At ten @CAPS1 we arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 and they were a lot of people there. I was so excited because not a lot of my friends have been to the @CAPS3 and it amazing there.  When @CAPS9 first get to the @CAPS3 in the morning its not hot enough to get into the @CAPS2 yet so me and all of my friends sat in the sun soaking it all up so we would get hot enough to jump off the @CAPS2 fall, or @CAPS9 can slide. My best friend at the time decided she was going to be the first brave one to slide in, ha she slid down the slide @CAPS14 her but and i forget to tell her that @CAPS9 have a chance of ripping your bathing suit bottoms, whoops she @CAPS8 she didn't even notice but when she came out from the waterfall she had a huge hole in the butt of her bathing suit. We all started laughing so hard her face turned bright red and then she was so embarrassed that she pushed us in the @CAPS2.  My parents had a great time and so @CAPS8 I. My family laughs a lot by the end of the day everyone cheeks hurt from laughing. Witch made everyone laugh even harder. By the time i had got home my cheeks hurt so bad i felt like they were just going to fall off. ha, but my parents and my friends all had a good time and that's all that matters to me, that was the best sixteenth birthday party ever, and i hope that my seventeenth is even better.

8," When I was younger i had a neighbor named @PERSON1. I didn't like her that much, she seemed a little stuck up to me. One day my mom made me go to a birthday party for her. I absolutely did not want to go! Somehow i ended up going. When we went she had gotten all of theses amazing gifts, I envied her at that moment. I started to get bored of partying thing so I went to explore the house. I know that snooping isn't a good thing but i was bored and ready to find some adventure in my day. I walked into a bedroom; nothing fun so i walked into another bedroom; empty. There was no adventure in this house i thought to myself. I finally entered the last bedroom. i walked in and saw a game cube. I had always wanted one so i decided to take a look at it; i looked at all of her games and found my favorite one, @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So i put the game in and started to play.           After about fifteen minutes of playing a girl came in. It was @PERSON1.""@CAPS3 are you doing in my room?!"" she yelled "" oh I'm so sorry i was bored out there so i came in here to play @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" i replied ""oh well that's fine."" @PERSON1 said. I was almost in shock because she didn't deemed like she cared in fact she even said that she didn't care. She was one confusing girl. She sat on her bed and began to watch me play.""would you like to play?"" i asked n a gentle voice."" after all it is you game"" ""sure."" she replied. we started to play together. After a while of playing we decided to stop. Then we sat on her bed and started to talk about ourselves.  She loved to do everything i loved to do. We were two peas in a pod. I started to think to myself that i had got the wrong impression from her. turns out she is a nice girl who is cool to hang out with. Later that night my mom came in the room and told me it was time to go, but i didn't want to go because i was having so much fun! So @PERSON1 asked her mom if i could stay the night and she said yes; so i stayed the night with @PERSON1. We stayed up so late telling secrets, telling stories and getting to know each other better. She was starting to become my best friend.  Since she lived right next door to me it was really easy for me to go and see her after school and on the weekends. I would go over there all the time; her house become my second home. Even throughout the @DATE1 we hung out all the time. I would do camping with her and her family, she would go on hiking trips with mine, and we would even have our own little camping trips in our backyards. She was my best friend in the whole world. I love her with all my heart.  To this very day she is still my best friend, well more like my sister because everyday we just become more and more closer. Didn't think that was possible but it is. We both moved out of our house and into bigger houses. Sadly we don't live next to each other anymore, in fact we live on two opposite sides of the town; but someway somehow we always find a way to still hang out and share our laughs. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.",39.0,6.0
8," Laughter is considered the best medicine by most. It's know to build friendships and be a big hit at parties and gatherings ranging in sizes from big to small. It makes awkward moments and priceless moments remarkable memories. A true story with laughter isn't hard to come by for most. Laughter surrounds us daily. Most relationships are filled with laughter whether there friendships, family or more. I want it to be know that this isn't a love story theirs no real ending. Its the truth from my finger tips to your hands. It was a @DATE1. Do you know those moments where there are so many things you could be doing, but you just sit there for hours on end? Well this was that kind of day. I reached over the couches arm and grabbed my iPod, leaning back on the couch I swiped my finger across the lock bar. I was scrolling around the app store looking for some free new games. I came across and app called mini nation now don't laugh or mark me with straight zeros yet just keep reading. The description read, ""An exciting new app of over a million teen users, reading to mingle and interact."" I thought why not and clicked download. I was a bit skeptical and was wondering what people would act like. I requested to be friends with five dozen people or more. I read about who they where briefly and saw some posts and there animated self and photos they put up. Some where clearly outrageous and disturbing, you could pick and choose. The only thing I ever wrote in my description was, ""I'm on here to meet knew people I suppose... I'm here to ask you @CAPS2 your life story?"" @CAPS1 time I sent a request I'd delete the standard message and type, ""@CAPS2 your story? @CAPS2 made you into who you are today?"" I'd always change it up and make it different. I gained a lot of friends very quickly. Some people didn't understand the question I explained it to more hen a handful of people. My in box and wall would be full of people telling me there stories or requesting me. They all found what I was doing to be quite interesting.  I asked this simple question because what better way to get to know someone? I've learned a lot of things about more then @NUM1 people, and no I'm not exaggerating. I @MONTH1 not remember everything or everyone. I can tell you a lot of people where grateful or relieved that someone wanted to hear there story, and I felt honored to hear them. Everyone's was different and so was @CAPS1 person. It opened my eyes to how different we all really are. What we've been trough, how we've been raised. told what to believe in or wear. How people found and outlet and how they got away from everyday stress we call life. I remember one guy in particular @PERSON1. His story was tragic at times, he hadn't been happy in a long time, but the first day we started talking he said I really made him smile a true smile. He just opened up to me which he said was very unusual. I would usually get someones story, they wouldn't ask for mine back and they'd say hi once in a while. With @CAPS3 I couldn't help but ask more questions something drew me in. We've been talking for quite a while now and it turned out he doesn't live that far away from me. We dropped mini nation and started to skype and text constantly. While we talked about tragic things like his brother passing away at eighteen because of a drunk driver crashing into his car on the freeway, we'd always find something to laugh about a while latter. We talked a lot and still do. something about him kept pulling me in and wanting to get to know him more. Our days of conversations where and are still filled with laughter. This relationship was a simple question between stranger, a friendship and now more.  I've been with @PERSON1 for a while now and as this essay @MONTH1 not be humorous or filled with jokes and laughter @CAPS1 sentence or two. Our days are filled with laughter and memories, stories. I brought up mini nation to bring up @CAPS3, and I brought up @CAPS3 to show a relationship of mine filled with laughter and memories to come. Laughter is the best medicine and opens your eyes, reveling new things, experiences, and people to come.",37.0,6.0
8," Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Three type of chocolate, one big twist, and it creates the best night. Chocolate equals a girls favorite food. Chocolate ice cream equals my favorite dessert. Chocolate syrup equals the best topping. The twist is to make my friends and I laugh all night.  The triple chocolate milk shake with a twist is the most chocolaty thing I have ever tasted. The twist to the shake is not a chocolate but sugar. Not just any sugar, but @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sugar. This in our triple chocolate milk shakes just makes it so much better.  The night of this famous delicious chocolaty milk shake there was six people testing it out, and find out how to make it the grandest of all milk shakes. Three girls and three boys, were all at my best friends @ORGANIZATION1's house. The boys were her brothers friends, and the girls was me and my two best friends, @PERSON1 and @ORGANIZATION1. With all of us together we experimented. Chocolate was our main ingredient. Chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup, but we had normal milk.  When we made the shakes we were already jumping off the walls. @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 were laughing so hard they were already on the floor laughing before any sugar had got to their system. I started cracking up when ice cream started flying and ended up all over the kitchen. There was ice cream on the floor, the ceiling, on the dog, in the sink, it was everywhere. I was in tears when @ORGANIZATION1's golden blond hair was chocolate syrup pored on it. She was freaking out and no one would do anything but to laugh.  Our first batch of milk shakes went to the boys. They hated it. They told us it was to chocolaty. When we tried it, we didn't think it was chocolaty enough. That lead to a second batch of milk shakes. This time we mixed the chocolate ice cream and syrup with chocolate milk. When we blended everything together, it just seemed nearly perfect. The three browns made the most beautiful color of chocolate brown ever. It seems like it was made for heaven. While the milk shakes were being made, us girls were being adventures. We looked around the kitchen to find something else to put in our heavenly milk shakes. That is when @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. A pure sugar stick with a bag full of sugar to @CAPS2 the stick in. It was brilliant! After the shakes we done being blended, we pored in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 sugar into the cups of milk shakes and stirred it with the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 stick. Then we cheered our glasses together and drank up.  First came the cold feeling, then the admit delicious chocolaty flavor, then it me, the sugar. With in seconds I had the sugar rush. All three of us were jumping around the kitchen, living room, all over the house. We couldn't stop moving. We were full of energy. The shakes was like a drug to us. We had to keep drinking it, we had this massive sugar high from it. No one could take it form us, we wouldn't let anyone. We couldn't resist it. The chocolate, the sugar, the energy was all to amazing to let go. That was until our last batch of shakes was taken from us. @CAPS7 one of the boys pored our shakes down the sink because he hated it. We freaked out. We didn't know what to do, with out our new drug. We needed a revenge. So we made a plan against @CAPS7. @CAPS7 is big guy. He is about six foot two and is two hundred pounds. We wanted to take him down that night. So @PERSON1 a tall, skinny, and dark haired girls walks in the living room, where @CAPS7 is sitting. She is wearing booty shorts and a tank top and she walks past him smiles and gives him a wink. That second she winks, @ORGANIZATION1 and I jump from behinds the couch and attacks @CAPS7. He burst out laughing sounding like @LOCATION1. We then just crack up laughing. We couldn't stop. My stomach was cramping, my eyes were watering, and I felt like was going to pee my pants.  Chocolate, sugar, friends, and laughter equals a great night. The best moments is normally come with the pain of laughter. The best times normally involves friends and sugar including chocolate. The beta high is the sugar high. My best time is with the triple chocolate shake with a twist.",37.0,6.0
8," I walk out from behind the curtain and step out onto the dark stage. I adjust my suspenders, pop into character, look at my chalkboard and then the lights flash on. Before I can even move or utter a single word the audience roars into absolute hysterics. With every breathe, every step, and with every thought I could hear the audience erupt into a frenzy of hysterics. From beginning to end the audience continued to roar with laughter until the lights went down. Then all of a sudden it was quiet. The quietness left me as an actor in as much suspense as the audience was to meet for one @TIME1 @TIME1 up on the stage. My fellow cast members walked on one by one for curtain call. The suspense as well as the volume of the audience increased until it was @TIME1 for me to walk out onto the stage for the @TIME1, and then, it happened. The suspense I had felt finally just exploded from the crowd like a volcanic blast with each step I took toward them. With each step they grew louder and then, I stopped. The lights went down and as I had begun I was alone on the dark stage.  After the cheering had stopped I ran to meet my cast and my best of friends in the dressing rooms. The second I walked into the room I was greeted with hugs, kisses, and sheer joy. We tore our costumes off and threw on our everyday clothes and ran as fast as we could possibly run to the lobby of the auditorium because their we believed we would find some very congratulatory fans waiting for us.  To our surprise their was more than just a few people waiting for us. It felt like the entire city of @LOCATION1 had come to congratulate us on such a wonderful performance. I shook hands and talked to many people but in a corner of the lobby I noticed an old man standing their with his sobbing eyes staring at me. I at first was slightly creep-ed out by this man because he would not take his eyes off me and after what had felt like an hours worth of thanking people I decided to do the same with this old man. I walked up shook his hand and looked into his big sobbing eyes and thanked him for coming. Before I could pull away he collapsed into my arms and began to cry like a new born baby. After a minute of attempting to comfort the poor man he said, ""@CAPS1, thank you. You have a true gift my boy and that is to bring people laughter."" I smiled at him but I wasn't quite sure what he truly meant by this. It was then that I noticed the pink bandanna around his arm and my eyes widened. He gave me a warm smile and said, "" @CAPS2, my boy, I am what you think I am. A poor diseased old man. Now for me too end my life knowing that I got to see someone live out the dream I had once longed for is incredible. I wish you good luck in the future and I hope that someone will bring you as much laughter and joy as you have brought me."" I smiled, gave the old man a hug, and thanked him one @TIME1 @TIME1. When I began that day I thought that I was going to just get a few laughs and get a few congratulations but I never even dreamed of making a huge impact in someones life just by making them laugh. On this day I learned though that anyone can make a difference when they can bring joy or laughter to another person. Their is many reasons why I will continue to entertain, the first is that I absolutely love it. The second is that I now know how I can make a difference in this world and that is through the power of laughter.",37.0,6.0

""ok ok i am hold on."" she opend her cabnet and got out @NUM2 controlers and handed one to me. A few seconds later she turned on the game cube. we played for about an hour when jordyn got up and left the room "" where are you going?"" i asked.

"" hey @CAPS1 draw a flower on my hand!"" jordyn said grabbing the marker and following him out of the room. A few moments later she walked in with the marker. "" look at i isnt it cool?"" she said showing me her hand. "" yeah thats way cool i want one! but wait will it wash off/"" i asked.

8,"Laughter. It's one of the many things that helps us live our lives. Without laughter our world would be blank. It would seem depressed and black. The world revolves around laughter. It thrives on it. Laughter also helps not only our world, but ourselves. It helps us get through tough days. It diminishes our heart ache and sadness.Laughter can also help keep us mentally strong. It can help us overtake many challenging obstacles. Laughter helped me through the hardest obstacle in my life. It helped me put a man in prison. His name was @PERSON1. He married my mother and slept in her bed. Acted like a normal husband and step father. Til night came around. @CAPS1 would come and sneak into my room when I was only @NUM1 years old. He raped me many times. Until I was @NUM2.When I finally turned @NUM2, I decided enough was enough. It was time to put @CAPS1 in prison. When this happened, it of course took a lot of courage and self determination. But what it mostly took was lots of love and support from my family and friends. Laughter helped me put @CAPS1 in prison by how it made me happy. Happiness is the one thing that made me put him away for seven years. My family and friends would always make me laugh when I felt down or depressed. It was very hard though. It took a lot of energy to make me feel good about myself again.When being raped, it felt like no one loved me. Like I was all alone in the world. Empty. Til my freinds would wake me laugh and smile. Them I would feel good again. Feel renewed. Loved. To this day I still get depressed and down feeling. My friends will then try to make me laugh and make me feel better. Most of the time this works. However there are some times that nothing works.Laghter is one of the many things that can get your day going. It can help you get through the toughest things in life. Help you put hurtful people in prison like I did. Making someone is also another way to show them you care. Helping somebody laugh will always brighten there day. So think, have you helped anyone accomplish a devilish task by making them laugh? ",38.0,6.0
8," When I was younger there was a lot that would make anyone laugh. Many times my family in @LOCATION3 would come visit us in @LOCATION1. One specific time, we all decided to travel to @ORGANIZATION2, which would be mine and my younger sister by two years' first time going. So we all waited for my great-grandparents to come and pick my parents, uncles, grandma, sister and I to pick us up in their tiny @CAPS1. My great-grandparents decided to bring a few extra people, including my great aunt and @CAPS3, their @NUM1 year-old son and their @NUM2 year old son. By the time we were all packed into the @CAPS1 there was hardly any space to move. The trip from our home in @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 was a little over @NUM3 @DATE1. For a child my age, it wasn't the best thing in the @ORGANIZATION2, and for my younger sister and cousin, it was even worse. My great-grandma decided to give all the kids some candy, by the time it was finished, we were all sticky and had red sticky faces. My @CAPS3 @PERSON2, who was in his sophmore year of high school, helped clean us all up. The car ride was long and boring, by the time we had gotten there it was past midnight. My great-aunt and her husband and son, decided to get a cabin in the middle of nowhere, where my family, uncles, and grandma, stayed in a simple hotel. My great-grandparents, parked their @CAPS1 in the @ORGANIZATION2 parking lot. The next morning, we all met up at @ORGANIZATION2, my great-aunt told us her story about out at the cabin, her bed was filled with moths, not a very fun @TIME1 for them. We all entered the park and split up. If I'm not mistaken, we were at @ORGANIZATION3, where the have the @CAPS5 show. By @TIME1, we all gathered for the show and sat and watched it. In the middle of the show, it began pouring rain. We all went back to the @CAPS1, everyone completely soaked, good thing it was @DATE3 or we would have freezed. Once in the @CAPS1, my great-grandma gave us all towels to dry off with and began laughing at us. She then drove us back to our hotel and we dried off, by that time, the ran had stopped.  Once we were all dry, my uncles decided to go swimming, and it was getting pretty late. We all went to the pool and played around for awhile, when we got back, we were just as wet as we had been @DATE1. We all dried off and got ready for bed. My sister and I laid in the bed we had to share, my parents in the bed beside us. It didn't take long for the two year-old to fall asllep. When she sleeps, she takes up a lot of room, so sharing the bed with a two year-old baby, I only got a corner of the bed. She still sleeps the same way.  On the way back to a different park that morning, the entire way, my dad kept saying, ""I'm ready, are you ready?"" and we would say it back and forth between each other, which had my little sister laughing. Once at the park, we all went on some rides, including The @CAPS8 @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11, which turned out to be my @CAPS3's favorite ride even though he got wet. We met many different characters, @PERSON1, stuck out in my mind because she tried to keep my dad as we began leaving. As it got later, we went to a couple more rides then got ready for the @ORGANIZATION1, which to this @DATE2 is my favorite @ORGANIZATION1, then we saw the firework show. By the @DATE2, we were all work out and ready to go to bed. I can't really remember how many days we stayed in the park, but I know everyone had a lot of fun, apart from my great-aunt on the first @TIME1 with all the moths and bugs in her bed when she went to lay down.",39.0,6.0
8," I believe everyone needs to laugh in there life, a lot. Without laughter the world doesn't turn. I guess you could say I will go out of my way to make anyone be happy and at least smile. So I have this friend and she means a lot to me so I don't like to see her mad, upset, or even unhappy. I try to do I can to keep it so she is. We actually met in the @NUM1 grade in @PERSON1's class she was always getting torn down by that evil lady and I just felt so bad, I knew I had to do something. I didn't exactly know what though. I was only a little @NUM2 year old and @PERSON1 was a very stern lass who never ran out of rude things to say. So I gathered my information and weighed my pros and cons, instead of deciding to be rude and hurtful back to @PERSON1 I decided to kill her with kindness just as my grandma had taught me to do. I knew it would take a lot and I was ready to take on this challenge.It was the @DATE2 after a long @DATE1 and I was just ready for @PERSON1 to try and break my friend @PERSON2 down just a little bit more. I got up early just to get to school, so I ate my bowl of @CAPS1' @CAPS2 and I was out the door. We hung up our coats and our backpacks and got seated to our desks and started to listen to our principals announcements, and you know it @PERSON1 had already started jumping down @PERSON2's throat because @PERSON2 had started to bite her nails. Now don't get me wrong @PERSON2 @MONTH1 have known just how to irritate @PERSON1 and push her buttons but @PERSON2 is only @NUM2, not trying to make any excuses for her but screaming at her and singling her out in the class room was in my opinion the wrong way to approach or teach @PERSON2 whatever lesson she was trying to tech her. I mean @PERSON2 is only human, and a habit isn't easy to kick even if your only @NUM2 years-old. @PERSON2 wasn't the type of kid to purposely aggravate someone intentionally. You could say it just kind of happened. I could also see where @PERSON1 was coming from also, she didn't want fingernails everywhere but I won't let this rest she was really rude on how she went about it. Since @PERSON2 was such a nice person I decided to take action. @PERSON2 and I sat across the table group and I could tell she was a little discouraged I just started talking to her and that cheered her up a little bit but then I knew it was time for plan b, jokes. I started telling her chicken jokes, she just began to laugh. I would to occasionally just because of the fact I knew I was making school a more enjoyable place for her, I believe it should be one of the most amazing places ever. Soon enough we had code names, @CAPS3 for myself and @CAPS4 seed for her. I don't recall how exactly we got these names they just kind of stuck and it used to make @PERSON1 so mad, we loved it and we would write it on the heading of our papers as our name. Finally, I think we broke the camels back because the day @CAPS4 seed former known as @PERSON2 got a sticker on her paper due to her writing her name in perfect cursive and we just laughed and laughed. We thought it was the funniest thing ever. Days turned into weeks and weeks led to months and as soon as we knew it, it was @DATE3 and school was getting let out. We made a promise the last day of school to never forget our year together, and to still call one another @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 seed. We held that promise and to this day we are still very close and occasionally run into @PERSON1 at our small-town local store and just laugh but that year I learned more than just how do do multiplication or how to read over a thousand pages in a book all of that could have been taken away all that matters about that year was making friends with @PERSON2 and truly learning that laughter is the essence of life and that means more to me than anything else my fourth grade year. I mean really how often does an @NUM2 year-old go that far out of there way to help another kid this was true and @PERSON2 and I have learned and found many more things to laugh about as we have grown up and it means more to me than anything else.",36.0,6.0
8,"                                  Getting @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Laughter     @CAPS3 they say, "" Laughter adds on more years to your life"". It's what makes things more enjoyable. I've had so many moments in which laughter was involved. Let me share one of those times...    It all started on the day of my band concert. My best friend @PERSON1 came to watch, @CAPS3 so did my mom and sister. I was in the band room warming up @CAPS2 the rest of the band while the stage room filled up @CAPS2 about one hundred people.An hour went by. It was our turn. @CAPS3 our band walked up onto the stage, I was looking for my mom, sister, and @LOCATION1. I found all three of them sitting right next to each other. I smiled. They smiled back. About an hour later, our concert was over. @CAPS3 the stage room was emptying out, the band were taking the chairs and stands back to the band room. I found my mom and sister and we went out to find our car.   When we started driving @CAPS1, I noticed @PERSON1 running behind us. My mom and I started laughing. When we came near the exit out of the school parking lot, my mom stopped and rolled down the window. @PERSON1 walked up to our car and yelled, "" I love you @PERSON2!"" That's my mom's name. Finally after about five minutes of talking and not letting us leave, we headed over down the road to a fast food place; leaving @PERSON1 behind at the school. While my mom was ordering, I heard this screaming. It sounded like an @CAPS4 call. I looked my head out the window and there was @PERSON1 hanging her head out the window of my other friend, @PERSON3's, car, screaming at my mom and I. My mom and I just burst out laughing. About five minutes later, we were done ordering. We knew @PERSON1 was waiting around the corner for us, so my mom decided to go the opposite direction to play a trick on her. Just @CAPS3 we thought, there we seen @PERSON1 running towards @PERSON3's car. She had noticed that we didn't come her way.     After my mom, my sister, and I, got on the highway towards our house, I had gotten a text message on my phone from @LOCATION1 saying she was going to follow us on the highway to our house. I told my mom what she said and we all just laughed.  Laughter; the best medicine in life. If it wasn't for my friends, family, and the little enjoyable things in life, my life would be boring. My story was a true life experience in which my best friend pumped up her crazy side and did some funny things to make us laugh. A life without laughter, would be like having no life at all.",38.0,6.0
8," Laughter's reason of element  @CAPS1 exception there are many reasons why laughter is very important, but this is my reason why laughter is considered its own element for more than one way. Laughter is used in many results, as when you respond to someone's activates or ideas. Another way why laughter is it's own element is when people or yourself are in a bad situation, you always want to look on the bright side of things. Laughter is many small examples that are describing its self in one element. Laughter to me is very important especially at a time in need. For example my family is going through tough times right now for the reason that my oldest sister might have cancer. I am always looking for ways to make her laugh. To me her laugh is the most important to me because it's my job to keep her with hope and to at least keep her happy. I know when we get through this I will always have laughter with me and will use it in many different ways. I have never thought I would be using laughter at this kind of time and hopefully I never have to again. Eventually laughter is used is in relationships. I agree that laughter is an important part in a relation ship because that is all my family have in theirs. My oldest brother has had one relationship his hole entire life and has kept it going my using laughter to his advantage. The funny part in this is that him and his wife make fun of everything from each other to everything around them including their daughters. Laughter to them is the most important part of their relationship. To me every relationship should have laughter and I'm glad that everybody has that element to express. Using laughter in a relationship must be cautious because not in every situation can you or want to use it. Laughter in a relationship can be the best or the worst depending in the timing.  Finally laughter is used in many ways like bullying or joking and laughter fits in all of these categories. When someone laughs at somebodies offensive jokes toward somebody else they are going to continue to keep picking on that person or others. In this generation there is not much bullying, but when there is it gets serious and some times out of hand. Our generation doesn't know how to handle a bad comment, so we take it like a threat. Laughing in those situations aren't good they cause trouble. There is a difference between laughing to jokes and laughing to bad comments. In jokes when you laugh don't hurt any one, but they do give the person who says it confidence. I love it when people laugh at my jokes because it makes my self-e-steam way higher. @CAPS1 making people happy you don't get laughter, and happiness is what gives laughter its it's way of use. Therefore, if laughter is considered an element just for one reason, I think its wrong because there are limitless reasons why it's considered an element. I also hope these reasons help explain why laughter is considered an element for more than one way. Laughter is and will always be needed for everyone. ",39.0,6.0
8,"                          The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 believe that the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is true. Laughter is something that will always bring people together. Without it, life would be boring, uninteresting and nothing would be the same. Laughter is how I met most of the people I am friends with today, including my best friend. It was probably, a month into sixth grade. Maybe even longer. I walked into @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I didn't really like @CAPS15 class. It was boring and I never really talked to anyone, just sat there silently listening to what the teacher had to say. @CAPS8 went on about @CAPS15 project we had to do. @CAPS8 held up poster after poster, explaining every detail and what her expectations were. I liked @PERSON1, @CAPS8 made everything easy to understand and I was never confused on anything @CAPS8 explained. The task was to chose a topic that had something to do with ancient @LOCATION1, and then create a poster and be ready to present it to the class by next week. I thought about it for a while. I hated doing speeches. I didn't want to get in front of the class at all, but I didn't really have any other choice. I decided I was going to make mine about @CAPS6. I heard a lot about her, @CAPS19 I figured that @CAPS15 speech was going to be pretty easy. The bell rang loudly, drawing me out of my thoughts. It wasn't the bell that told us that our next class was starting, it was the bell that rang when we had a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break. I sighed and sat back down at my desk, while almost everyone else, bolted out the door to talk to their friends. I thought the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 break was a waste of time. What was there to do in @CAPS1 minutes? Nothing. I sat there, taking out a piece of paper and a pen, and started drawing. Rather than talk to people I didn't know, I always chose to sit at my desk and draw. I drew random things and often wrote lyrics to songs that were stuck in my head, waiting for those @CAPS1 minutes to pass. The paper I had, was from over the past couple weeks @CAPS19 it was chalk full of random drawings. I continued doodling on the paper, until I heard a loud smacking noise. I frowned and turned around, to see who or what had made the noise. When I looked behind me I saw someone moving @PERSON4's, the person who usually sat behind me, backpack, binder and books to another desk. The loud noise I had heard was her books smacking onto the desk, a row over from where @CAPS8 usually sat. I was confused not only because I wasn't sure what @CAPS15 person was doing, but also because I didn't recognize her at all. ""@CAPS7!"" @CAPS8 said in a very friendly tone, sitting in @PERSON4's seat. I frowned and waved anyways, ""@CAPS9..."" I wasn't really good with meeting new people, especially ones I have never seen before. I glanced at the clock, and realized that we only had a few more minutes until class resumed. ""@CAPS10 do know that someone else sits there, @CAPS12?"" I asked. @CAPS8 nodded, ""@CAPS11, I know."" @CAPS12 after @CAPS8 responded, @PERSON4 walked back into the class. @PERSON4 was nice, but I didn't really like her. @CAPS8 talked way to much and half of what @CAPS8 was saying I didn't pay attention to. Overall, I guess I kind of felt bad for her. @PERSON4 stood there staring at the desk, where her things once were laying. @CAPS8 looked confused, but very frustrated, ""That's my seat."" @CAPS8 said. The person who sat in her seat responded with, ""@CAPS14 it's not."" @CAPS15 made me laugh a little. ""@CAPS16 it it."" @PERSON4 said, raising her voice. The person shook her head, ""@CAPS14, your stuff is @CAPS12 there."" @CAPS8 pointed to a totally different desk. @PERSON4 sighed in frustration, but gave up and sat at her new seat.  Both of us started laughing. ""@CAPS19 what's your name?"" The stranger asked me. ""I'm @PERSON3, what's yours?"" I asked. @CAPS8 laughed, ""I'm @PERSON2.""We sat there talking about what we were going to do our projects on, and discovered that both of us, were doing it on @CAPS6. The rest of the class went by pretty fast. Well, faster than usual. @PERSON2 and I just sat there laughing and making jokes the majority of the class period, which made the class @CAPS19 much better than it usually would have been. Ever since that day @PERSON2 and I have been best friends, even now. I find it weird that now, when we haven't seen each other in a really long time all we do is laugh. @CAPS15 story is why I believe that the saying, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" is true, because without laughter I don't think a lot of us would have the friends that we have now. Without laughter @CAPS15 place would be really, really boring.",42.0,7.0
8," ""@CAPS1 in the @CAPS2.""  The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 look back on an event in someone's life; more emotions build on that one thought of the past then they do in the @CAPS2 of the event itself. A few weeks earlier was my @CAPS2. I awoke at approximately five forty in the morning excited to go to our wrestling tournament at @LOCATION1 ridge @ORGANIZATION1. I had placed fifth at @CAPS6 tournament the previous year, and couldn't wait to get the day started. When we met at the @ORGANIZATION1 I had already built myself a bad start @CAPS5 being exactly one pound over the weight I had to wrestle. The drive only lasted an hour, and I knew our scale was heavy. It still worried me. Upon arrival both a fellow teammate and I had to go cut weight. We ran together for just over a half hour. Each of us made it with ease. Me weighing nearly two pounds under. As a team, we relaxed and waited for more schools to show up. We ate and watched the other wrestlers begin their warm ups. Something about that morning didn't feel right, my bones were aching and my muscles felt a little tender from cutting weight just a little bit earlier. My warm up was sloppy and slow. It grew harder to want to move after each drill we did. It ended with a few short sprints, and @CAPS4 went extra slow as well. The mats got cleared, and shortly after that, matches began. A lot of our guys won their first match, and it got to me fast. At first when I saw the kid I had to wrestle, I thought I was lucky. The previous year I pinned the two guys ahead of him in their varsity line ups. One thing I couldn't get my mind of though, he looked strong. The match just before ours ended quickly, and I felt very tense, like I wasn't ready. Our hands shook and the whistle blew. His collar tie was weak ""it shouldn't be long before a good shot opens."" I thought to myself. I was wrong. When the @CAPS2 came I took the shot and got @CAPS1 in a bulldog, and it was becoming nearly impossible to breathe.That's it, my last vivid scene from the match was me trying to do an arm drag to get out of his bulldog. All I remember beyond that point was seeing some color changes in my mind. I awoke to coach and a few other people over me and it took me a @CAPS2 to realize what had happened. Coach looked at me, smiled and said "" @CAPS3 pissed yourself @PERSON2."" @CAPS4 words taunted me in the back of my mind repeatedly that day. My body went into a complete shut down mode while I was knocked out. A few of my team mates told me that my legs shook like I was going into shock. I relaxed the rest of that day just because it was a little disheartening, @CAPS5 the time @DATE1 came, I was back ready to go again.  @CAPS6 team is my family together we drive our bodies to the limit everyday, only to go home sleep, and do it all over again. The guys didn't mention what happened to me other then to answer my questions or to see how I was doing despite my little event. Most people would be embarrassed @CAPS5 an experience like that, but thanks to the support of my team when it happened, I wrestle just that much more cautiously, meaner, and stronger. Every week there is at least one day where everyone feels great. We are working hard and enjoying it in the process. We love cracking jokes and goofing around. So me and senior captain @PERSON1 always play around with the thought of what happened to me. Sometimes he will get a head lock and I start making my legs twitch like I was told they did, and we both get a good laugh from it. Other times we talk about how it felt to be knocked out. To be honest it wasn't bad all that bad either. It felt like I just woke from a nap, and was well rested, even though I was only out for a minute or so. It is my @CAPS2, and it was both embarrassing and scary when it happened. Now it is one of the funniest stories I have to tell from wrestling. Most people, I guarantee, have not been to as many places as I , or have had as many experiences as me either. Out of all of them, @CAPS6 will probably be one I remember for a while because it is one of @CAPS4 moments where in the @CAPS2 it is scary, but the hindsight it is funny. Plus I enjoy @CAPS4 moments with my team when we can laugh about the little things and grow a stronger bond because of it.                                     ",44.0,7.0
8,"Hey have you heard that laughter is the best medicine? @CAPS3 topic I'm writing about is how laughter is important in a relationship .I have some story's about laughter and how it has helped me or hurt me.Well I have a younger friend(shes like two years younger then me)and every now and again we get into some really bad arguments.We can argue for what seems like hours and hours on end.These arguments just seem to happen @CAPS1 start up really fast,too and there weird arguments like sometimes about shows on @CAPS2,other times its about her not paying attention to @CAPS3 feelings or about how she treats @CAPS3 things but normally its about her attitude.This one time about a year ago we had a really bad argument it happened like this:we were in the living room and she just tossed her trash on the floor so i got up and started yelling at her because @CAPS3 house is not a dumpster,granted it only looks like one.She got mad so she started being snotty,hissing at me and yelling back.When i told her i had invited her into @CAPS3 house and she treated me really badly she started to draw and ignore me so i took her drawing away and she yelled at me.I guess what she yelled was so funny i guess i started laughing and she started laughing and we stopped arguing.We also argue about the things she says or does with her siblings.Shes not the nicest sister to them and when she gets to yelling at them i say something stupid and @CAPS1 all start laughing.Laughing has helped me get over fights a lot and has helped me solve problems like:@CAPS3 younger friends sister was at the park and we were all playing but her sister fell off a really tall building she hit her head and cut her forehead open a little bit.She started crying so i went over and said why did you fall off?I also told her not to trip over gravity and she started laughing and after we got her cleaned up she was @CAPS4 and started playing again. I guess laughter really is the best kind medicine.All I know is that laughing makes her feel better.laughing helps in different ways.Ive made friends by laughter.Actually that is basically how I met all @CAPS3 friends. a lot of @CAPS3 friends are funny and @CAPS1 make me laugh.You know sometimes laughing doesn't always help like I was at least five and i was at the park playing,I had just moved to amity and i had no friends, so I was playing on the jungle gym and by accident some kid knocked me off of it.I got hurt and almost all of the kids started to laugh at me I felt really bad.and sometimes I laughed at other kids when @CAPS1 got hurt and after i felt really bad so instead i laughed with them.So laughing all the time isn't the best choice.All I'm saying is laugh only when its appropriate because you can hurt or help someone with laughter.Be careful because laughing is helpful and hurtful.",39.0,6.0
8," Most of the time we spend our time talking to the same people and judging others because we do not know them. One thinks that there is nothing you and some people can ever come close. Laughter is one of the many puzzle pieces in life that can change things the way you see them. It can even bring two different people that have never considered talking or meeting each other. All though we must never doubt the power of sharing a laugh with someone because it can end up being a break through to a new beginning. We all share the ability to laugh and is a trait that everyone has in common. Why not take that ability to laugh and use it to break the ice with people and start several life long friendships. Instead of making up our own excuses to avoiding the task to try to meet and talk to different people. As the school camping trip approached, I knew I had to think of something that was going to help me get closer to others. This some what long trip was going to require me to get along with students I had never talked to especially certain people. I had to come up with some plan right when one of the teachers was calling out the names of the people in every group. It wasn't very hard for me to start a conversation with people but except people that were on a higher social status then me. Finally it was my group that the teacher was yelling out and so far I knew the name's of the people she was calling. Until she clearly read out the last name from the my group and I started to panic. Most of the people from my group for my cabin were my friends, all but one of them. All the groups happily gathered up, but I was left thinking of what a long trip this was going to turn out to be.  Until now, I had spent a lot of my time thinking that the last girl called in my group was mean. She seemed arrogant and self centered to ever me or her considering talking to each other and definitely not fiends. I had no idea about what I was going to do to make things easier during the camping trip. There couldn't possibly be anything that existed in this world that would bring us close. Talking to her was not a idea I had ever considered because students worshiped her, unlike me. Every girl wanted her in their cabin, but they, like me were missing a quality to bring her close from the long distance. Many attempted to get her closer, but no one had been successful in making her a true fiend. I however was determined to find that something to bring us close even if we didn't end up being best friends. The day of the camping trip, we arrived to the location of the trip, and got our cabins assigned to us. Everybody went to their cabin to take their belonging's they had brought with them and make ourselves comfortable. Surprisingly the cabin was supposed to be for a group of girls to share the tiny space and sleep in. As I unpacked my own things many of the girls began to talk to me about the trip. Would the other girl and I both get the curiosity to talk to each other? She actually did step toward me and began to have a real one word ""conversation"" with me.  When the fun activities finally ended, we were sent off to go to sleep. Sure like a cabin filled with girls was really going to be able to go straight to sleep and sleep all night. Right when the cabin door closed, the noise and giggles began, including mine. The girls that had never talked to me started to to tell a scary story to scare everyone. She got up and said she had to go to the restroom and I had to go with her. We briskly walked to the bathroom without saying a word. I waited for her until she was finish and we started to walk back to the cabin. Until the silence was broken with a eerie sound that was made behind us. Both of us ran, screaming even laughing to the cabin. Confused, asked her why she was laughing and she responded that we were silly for being scared. Amazed that she was talking to me, I agreed with her, laughed a lot and by the end we were close friends. Laughter can force you see the bright side of people instead of the negative. Its an element that you can give or receive from others, but never take away. If you ever have the chance to make someone laugh, go and do it. Not only can it bring endless joy, but it can also impact a time period in your life. Friends wouldn't have been discovered if it weren't for everyone carrying the ability to laugh.   ",38.0,6.0
8," You @CAPS1 @CAPS2't @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 you get the giggles, sometimes they're really hard to get rid of. Actually, they're almost always hard to get rid of. If you've ever had a close friend or family member that you have a ton of fun with, then you know what I'm talking about. Laughter is a tremendously amazing thing and enormously contagious. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 come, even if @CAPS4's not the time or place to let @CAPS4 overcome you. My new slippers were on, along with the fresh new jeans as we walked into the sanctuary late @CAPS6 @CAPS10 @TIME1. Drowsiness was slowly creeping in as I listened to the first few @CAPS6 hymns. To my right sat my little brother @PERSON1, on the other side was my older sister @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 was back from college, and home for @CAPS6 break. Over the last few years we grew very close, becoming best friends. Although before then, you would have thought we were completely different children. We were always arguing and hitting one another, and she was always frustrated and angry with me, being the pesky younger sibling of course. We sat quietly listening to the traditional ""@CAPS6 @CAPS10"" talk. As the @TIME1 went on we began to feel an eagerness between us. Not so much a tension as we used to, but a sense of silliness. As I knew she would get annoyed, I let out three quick glances in her direction. Without expecting any sort of response, she reacted with a stern but non serious facial expression. I cracked a small smile. I quickly realized she was in a good mood. I now say that her response was the reason I started the facial expressions. I looked at her again and got more of a reaction. As one of us cracked a slight smile, the other looked away trying to not let the smile spread. This process went on for awhile before the giggles came. @CAPS4 was hard to concentrate on the sermon, especially @CAPS5 @CAPS4 wasn't a good time to laugh! As we thought we were almost done with holding our breaths and clinching our eyes shut, we began again, hearing each others quick breaths of air and bouncing stomachs. Laughing overcame us and became uncontrollable. Tears of laughter rolled down our faces. My clenching hands left my lap to cover my mouth and plug my nose in hopes of keeping from inhaling huge amounts of oxygen. I think if we had been standing we would have had to sit because we would have fallen over. We heard the preacher start to speak loudly, which he does @CAPS5 he's about to finish up his speech with a strong meaning. We did our best to @CAPS3 our bodies and finish up the @TIME1, trying to act like the young adults that we were. We managed to compose ourselves @CAPS1 in time. The congregation stood at the @TIME1 and got in a big circle to pray. We held hands and closed our eyes. Sometimes Laughter @CAPS2 ease a stressful moment. Often @CAPS4 @CAPS2 change a situation. Other times @CAPS4 @CAPS2 come from a humorous action or event. Possibly like me, @CAPS4 came from nowhere. I like to think @CAPS4 came from a reaction I got, a little smile, and lack of sleep. I say this because @CAPS5 I closed my eyes for that prayer, our hands were tightly together and I then felt her laughter and bouncing motion travel to me, again. As hard as we tried to keep them back, we realized how uncontrollable @CAPS4 was to hide our laughter.",41.0,7.0
8," Laughter   @CAPS1 family is full of jokers. We are always teasing each other (in a good way) and cracking jokes (which @PERCENT1 of the time are actually funny). The fact that @CAPS1 family is so ""hilarious"" made the @NUM1 hour drive to @LOCATION1 slightly more bare able. @CAPS1 family is a grumpy family, always for the first hour or two of the day. @CAPS1 dad is grumpy if he does @CAPS2 get his food, @CAPS1 mom if she does @CAPS2 drink her coffee, @CAPS1 brother if he does @CAPS2 get his sleep, and @CAPS1 sister for the sake of being grumpy. I however am almost never grumpy so our trip had some conflicting ""interests"". We had begun our trip to @LOCATION2 by waking up at @TIME1, everyone got ready @CAPS1 dad ate, @CAPS1 mom drank her coffee, @CAPS1 brother napped, and I ignored @CAPS1 sister. After all of this we finally left at @TIME2, which began the next phase of our trip which was to drive for @NUM2 hours with as few bathroom breaks as possible until we reached @CAPS1 dad's friend's house. The @NUM2 hours did @CAPS2 fly by like I had hoped mainly because @CAPS1 family was @CAPS2 as talkative as I predicted and music on the radio is only interesting for so long, but none the less we finely made it to @CAPS1 dad's friend's house.  From this point on in @CAPS1 story I will no longer refer to ""@CAPS1 dad's friend"" as ""@CAPS1 dad's friend, but I shall refer to him simply as @PERSON1. The reason I decided to do this is because this is his actual name and I assume that the reader is as lazy as me and does @CAPS2 want to constantly read ""@CAPS1 dad's friend"" no more than I want to write it, so for now on his name is @PERSON1.  @PERSON1's house is frequently used free hotel/pitstop that @CAPS1 family uses whenever we head in ""@PERSON1's"" direction. The reason for this is that it allows @CAPS1 dad to visit with a friend he only see's a couple of times a year and it saves money that would otherwise be spent on some random hotel. Through the many times which I have spent the night at @PERSON1's house I eventually learned that the only way for me to keep myself entertained was to plot and then execute a prank upon our host (also known as @PERSON1). I had eventually decided to use a tripwire at the entrance of his kitchen to set off a small but @CAPS2 too small firework in a nearby @CAPS3 cereal box, causing it to explode(you would be surprised what you can learn from old @ORGANIZATION1) and effectively scaring @PERSON1 and causing a small mess which I would inevitably have to clean up but it was worth it. The next morning I got up about @NUM4 minutes before everyone so I could very quickly set everything up. I got it all done in about @NUM2 minutes and then went off to hide in the living room behind a couch in which I could still see the entrance to the kitchen. I waited about @NUM6 minutes until I finally heard @PERSON1 grumble, wake up, and shuffle down the hall. He was now just about to enter the kitchen aaannnnd @CAPS4!!! The firework had gone off as planned and @PERSON1 looked very frightened, @CAPS1 family had woken up and came in to see what was going. They found me behind the couch dieing of laughter. I had to clean all cereal up as was expected.After everything had been said and done with we all laughed about @CAPS1 awsome prank, and @CAPS1 family and I left on our trip to @LOCATION2.   This paticular story @MONTH1 @CAPS2 have some @ORGANIZATION1 meaning or symbol, but I decided to write about it because it made me laugh and I hope whoever is reading it laughs too.  (@CAPS5.S- for those of you who think this story is to great to have actually happened I would like to gaurantee that it is indeed true and like all true stories has been slightly edited to be more intresting and more importantly to make me look good.)  @CAPS6 ",40.0,7.0
8," This friend was really like @CAPS21 soul mate sister. Have you ever felt a connection like that with your friend? Where everything you do is absolutely a blast, even if all you did all day was stalk cute boys on @CAPS1, and eat @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all day long? Or, when you have a bad day, and don't want to talk about @CAPS11, that friend can place their finger on exactly what happened and if not exactly, pretty dang close? I'd never had a friend like that. Until @CAPS21 sophomore year.  Her name was @PERSON1, and @CAPS9 was new to @CAPS21 @ORGANIZATION1. I've always been the quiet, easily intimidated type, so I stayed away. Until about two weeks into the new @ORGANIZATION1 year that is. ""@CAPS5, @CAPS6 right?"" @PERSON1 said as @CAPS9 leaned @CAPS21 way. @CAPS9 was only about five lockers down from me. Funny, I hadn't even noticed that before. ""@CAPS7, that's me. What's @CAPS18?"" I said. Wondering what @CAPS9 needed and why @CAPS9 came to me of all people. I'm definitely not the 'coolest' student out there might I say. @CAPS9 looked so stuck @CAPS18, and too good for our @ORGANIZATION1, in the middle of no where. ""@CAPS8, I know this makes me sound like a loser, but I can't get @CAPS21 lock to open."" @CAPS9 mentioned, looking sort of embarrassed and desperate.  ""@CAPS10, no problem! What's your combo?"" I said, trying to sound nice, and easy to talk to. Maybe @CAPS9 isn't what I thought, I could always use a friend, I thought as I walked over to her locker.  ""@CAPS11's @NUM1. @CAPS11's a really crappy lock. @CAPS11 sticks for me. Maybe I just haven't got this whole lock thing down yet. In @LOCATION2, where I moved from, we didn't have lockers. I guess our @ORGANIZATION1 was too cheap or something."" @CAPS9 said, laughing at her comment and watching me fidget with her lock.  After around @NUM2 tries on the lock, and both of us laughing super hard about @CAPS11's difficulty, @CAPS11 finally popped open. Then, we just went our separate ways. But for the rest of the day, I kept wondering about her. That day went by, and then the week went by. I was still wondering about the new girl, @PERSON1. Where did @CAPS9 go for lunch? Did @CAPS9 already have a bunch of friends? Maybe I should just come out of @CAPS21 little shy girl shell and invite her to sit with me at lunch. But for some reason I just couldn't do @CAPS11. I'd get so close, and then, turn around out of fear of getting rejected. One day though, @CAPS9 came @CAPS18 to our table and asked to sit down. @CAPS9 had brought a full container of brownies to share, and wasn't hard to talk to at all. I was really excited. I couldn't help but have all these little fantasies about how me and her would be best friends forever, and dream about having sleepovers, and eating junk food and talking about he boys that we liked.  That @TIME1, I got on the computer and went on to @CAPS1, and sent her a friend request. @CAPS9 accepted! @CAPS9 was online at that same time, so I got @CAPS18 the guts, and sent her an instant message. ""I take @CAPS11, you haven't got any crazy plans for a @DATE2 @TIME1 either?"" I typed. ""@CAPS14. No of course not. The new girl has no friends, and does the same thing every weekend- sits at home, plays @CAPS15 with her little brother, and watches @CAPS16. What a life! How about you?"" ""@CAPS10 just about the same. No plans for tonight, or any other @TIME1. Ever. Where do you live?"" ""@CAPS18 the @LOCATION1. Basically the middle of no where.""  ""@CAPS19 hang out tonight? I can pick you @CAPS18, and you can stay the @TIME1?"" ""@CAPS20. Here's @CAPS21 # @NUM3. Call me when you leave and I'll give you @CAPS21 address."" @CAPS21 mom and I went and picked her @CAPS18 an hour later. After @NUM4 hours of being together, we had already hit @CAPS11 off. I could tell we would really become close friends. That @TIME1, we went out and hung out with boys we had never even talked to before! I guess we get more courageous around each other. We came home past curfew, and pulled an all @TIME1-er in @CAPS21 bedroom. Laughing all @TIME1 about the past events, and talking about what boys we think are cute, and what our families are like. That @TIME1 was the beginning of something special for me. I don't know if @PERSON1 knows that, but that friendship meant so much to me. I achieved the best friend I could ever ask for because of @PERSON1 asking me to open her locker and we laughed together. Something about laughing with someone, really connects people. Maybe because @CAPS11 makes them realize that those people are fun to be around? I'm not @CAPS20, but I just thank @CAPS22 every day that he gave me that one day in @DATE1 when @PERSON1 couldn't open her locker.",39.0,6.0
8," The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 it's high pitch squeaks, or deep belly bubbly laughter, if it causes the whole room to join unable to stop or is quiet enough for only few to hear, no matter the kind @CAPS20 all over the world laughs. Laughing is a @CAPS2 in which @CAPS20 can understand and I have had the privileged of single-handily witnessing an experience in which this exemplifies perfectly. High school can be an intimidating place to those who come from small middle schools @CAPS22 I did. My freshman year was overwhelming in the least, but a club called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 seemed to help me ""survive"" in a sense. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 consists of a mixture of sophomores, juniors and seniors in high school that work together to help freshman ""@CAPS4"" into high school. They do this by relating their own experiences, running orientations and organizing activities throughout the year. The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 members seemed to impact my freshman year @CAPS15 much that I decided to become a member myself. @CAPS16 applying and completing a @DATE1 of training I was assigned to my very first task, an orientation. It included being responsible for a group of students, taking them on a tour of the high school, talking to them about what high school was like and answering any questions they might have.  Now discrimination has always been something I am very strongly against, but I would be lying to you if I said that being assigned to a group of foreign exchange students for my very first orientation was what I had been imagining in my mind while I rehearsed my speeches. I thought I had prepared myself for any situation or circumstance but quite frankly, I didn't even know how to speak @CAPS9. ""@CAPS10-@CAPS10-@CAPS10-hello my name is @CAPS11 and I will be your @CAPS4 @CAPS5 leader for this morning."" I was @CAPS15 absolutely nervous, I couldn't tell but by the looks on their faces but I'd say they couldn't understand a word I was saying. ""@CAPS14 I will be giving you a tour of the high school, going over the recommended classes for you to take, and answering any questions you @MONTH1 have."" All eyes were on me, but not @CAPS15 much in an intently listening way but more of a ""what the heck are you saying"" sort of way. I decided that going on the tour first would be the best thing, since that would probably be something they all could understand. At least that was what I was sincerely hoping.  ""@CAPS15...first would you like to go on the tour of the high school?"" @CAPS16 a long pause a boy spoke up.  ""@CAPS17 tour"" @CAPS18 they all knew what they were doing and all got up and began to walk out the door without me. ""@CAPS19! @CAPS19 for me."" I said, jumping from my stool and sprinting to get ahead of them.  ""@CAPS20 stop please and come right over here!"" I fluctuated my voice trying to hide the irritation and frustration I was feeling.  ""@CAPS21 before we begin lets make sure we all stick together, this school is kind of big and I don't want anybody getting lost."" @CAPS22 I looked around at my group of students, I realized they all looked confused and irritated to be here. My heart began to sink to the bottom of my stomach. I was supposed to be inspiring this group of students, yet I couldn't even help them have a good time, none of them had even smiled.  ""@CAPS21 lets go, this way everybody!"" The @CAPS24 in which my classroom was attached was pretty unexciting, consisting only of a bathroom and an abundance of other classrooms. @CAPS22 I walked and began giving my tour, a few of my boys broke away from the group to use the restroom unannounced. I noticed them, and stopped the group to @CAPS19 for them and continued talking about anything I could think of. I only turned my head for a second when all of a sudden a scream came from the bathroom. My group quickly turned towards the commotion and out ran a girl who I did not recognize. Judging by the look on her face, she was horribly embarrassed and also quite disturbed @CAPS22 she quickly walked away from the restroom. Within seconds of the screams my three boys also exited the restroom. I was about to continue the tour when i realized what had just happened. @CAPS18 @CAPS15 did everybody else, because @CAPS20 instantaneously began to laugh. The agitated girl had screamed because the boys had been in the girls restroom along with her. A mixture of high pitched laughs, silent but sweet giggles, and a random snort from one of my group members is all it took for my group to finally start having a good time. Although we still couldn't understand each other, somehow the joining of laughter made it @CAPS22 if we could. Thanks to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of laughing, to this day members of my past foreign exchange orientation group, walk by me in the halls and spontaneously start to laugh.",42.0,7.0

So @PERSON1 didn't belive them so he wanted to see what would the teacher say. Day two they got up and went to school early in the moring.

So they first went to @PERSON1 and the results were that @PERSON1 was @NUM5 feet and @NUM6 so than they went to @CAPS1 so the results were that @CAPS1 was @NUM7 feet @NUM8. So there second teacher said that shouldnt be fighting over who is the tallest one and the other teacher add on you guys will change over years so maybe @PERSON1 will be the tallest one. @PERSON1 agree with the teacher that @CAPS1 is the tallest one. So @PERSON1 wanted to be the tallest one so he started doing pull ups,push ups.sit ups and hanging one the pull up bar for about @NUM2 min.

The only rule was to dress like you got hit by the @NUM1's @CAPS3(dress from a person in the @NUM1's). The music fit the theme, most songs were of those I never heard before. The decorations were bright colors of red, blue, yellow, green. Balloons covered the floor, there was no way to not move with @CAPS1 stepping on one and popping it. A table in the middle of the floor filled with once full bowls of chips, popcorn, and a party mix, empty soda bottled were falling off the tables. A once dancing group of guys were now huddled in a corner @NUM5, @PERSON4, @CAPS4). @PERSON4 was @PERSON1's boyfriend, @CAPS4 was @PERSON3's The party had died,only another girl was lying on the floor from exhaustion (@PERSON3) that only meant that we would go back to @PERSON1's house to change into more comfortable clothes and hang @CAPS1.  We all arrive at the house. I slip into inside @CAPS1 shorts(didn't notice that it was inside @CAPS1) and the black tank top underneath. When The rest of the girls and I exit @PERSON1's room we find that the boys had disappeared. @PERSON1 knew from her past that they did this to her all the time. We followed her @CAPS1 the door, through a gate, and outside. It was around @NUM6 but the sky looked like it was @NUM7 at night. A mist swirled like clouds in the sky. The moon was the only source of light, the mist would ever so often cover the moon like a blanket, leaving us in the dark. It was warm but still cold from the slight wind that began to pick up. None of us knew the time when we reached the park. In the day time it was bright and lively from the children that ran around, but here now it look like something from a horror movie. There was only one thing in the abandoned parking lot, @PERSON2's truck. The four of us hooked arms in the sight of the park. The path in front of us had dull orange glowing lamps that buzzed in effort not to go @CAPS1. Moths danced around them. The dark shadows seemed to ooze from the parts of the park that had no light. We could see a fully lit baseball field that seemed to sing to us. We all decided to go there and wait for the guys to come to us. We slowly began to make our way. We kept our eyes on the path in front of us, almost like if we were to even glance for a second any where else we would be snatched up by the shadows around us. The light was our protector from the light. Then @CAPS1 of no where @PERSON1 had screamed that almost sounded like a laugh. A guy (who would later be identified as her boyfriend) jump up behind a pole, for a second I thought he was a trash can so when he jumped up I flinched in surprise. He ran off leaving us with @PERSON1 who had some unkind things to say. We pushed on with hope that they would all be together so we can leave this place. When we rounded the winding path to the bridge we saw something white zoom by and disappear into the bushes, @PERSON2 was the only on wearing white so it must be him. We all then began running after @PERSON2 shouting for him stop @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 were still hooked arms and they fell together. We stopped chasing after him when he had disappeared, that's when we realize that we won't on the lilted path no more but in the shadows of the trees. My eyes adjusted to the dark right when I ran into a wall bushes. It seemed that the bushes went on for ever. I couldn't see the top of them. This is why @PERSON2 disappeared so quickly. Suddenly I was ripped away from the bushes. Unknowingly who it was I ran with them. The brightest light i seen all day was slowly making it way around the bushes to greet us in warm presents. When the baseball field came into full view I swear I heard angels singing. @PERSON3 was the first to break for the baseball field the rest of us followed her.  The baseball felt almost warm from the glittering lights that blinded you if you happened to stare at them. I danced in circular motions in the baseball field. I pulled by my pants to the ground. The four of us sat in the middle of the soaking wet field talking. Suddenly @PERSON3's watch beeped. Then @CAPS1 of nowhere the light shut off all at once. The four of us scream in surprise.

8," Laughter, it can be from a comedy movie or a good joke you just heard in the hallway. ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" it rings true so dearly to @CAPS4 sister any I. @CAPS4 sister goes through many doctors and many types of pains because of her disease. The way I help her get through it all is by watching some comedy movie or comedy televison show. One day, she was feeling terrible, and the one movie that I knew would help her wasThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2. She loves that movie because, she loves both of the starring actors, the comedy in it is rolling on the floor laughter, and she needed that little push of the romance that comes into the movie. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2; they are both amazing in their own ways, but in this particular movie it was terribly needed by @CAPS4 sister. These two actors' chemistry between each other helped so much with @CAPS4 sister. @CAPS4 sister, @PERSON3, stopped complaining about her terrible pain just five minutes into the movie! She asked me for popcorn, and to bring her a soda, I was happy to do so because I got to see her happy again. @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 @MONTH1 not know @CAPS4 sister, but she felt so much better that I got to enjoy the movie even more. I got to enjoy it more because I saw @PERSON3 happier, and not complaining or whining about any pain. This helped strengthen out relationhsip together because of the actors, she loved watching them both in this movie, and thanked me for it after it the movie was over. Although the movie does have dirty jokes, and is rated '@CAPS3' for it's profound language throughout, it is completely hilarious! @PERSON3 has loved this movie since she rented it, and bought it the next day at the store-for a good price-and has always loved watching it whenever she was feeling sad or stressed about something going on. I knew that this movie would help her enough to get her mind out of the pain. The saying, ""laughter is the best medicine,"" although @CAPS4 sister @MONTH1 not always fully agree helps her out more than she will ever know. During the movie, @CAPS4 sister would always laugh or gasp at a joke, and we would both just start laughing (sometimes we had to pause the movie because it was too funny) and I saw that we were getting closer as sisters. We had something in common that we both liked, a lot, and it made me feel better and I know her as well that we weren't fighting or arguing but enjoying each other's company. @CAPS4 mother came in at one point while we were watching the movie because she wanted to see what was so funny, and @CAPS4 mom ended up leaving because she doesn't really like the jokes in the movie. After that, @PERSON3 had to pause the movie again and both of us cracked up laughing all over again because of how traditional our mother is.  Although laughter helps a lot of the time, to get @PERSON3 to not focus on her pain even more I knew I would have to pick a romantic comedy because the romance gives her another dose of ""no pain."" @CAPS4 sister is a stereotypical girl who loves her 'chick flicks' and helps her get out of a 'funk.' @CAPS5 the romance and the humor that came out of it was one of the main reasons why she wasn't complaining. She was focused just on the movie, even though she knew what was going to happen in the end. The jokes that the actors' used throughout the movie that brought them together in the end (sorry that I ruined the ending) helped @CAPS4 sister laugh and have fun. She feels like a normal person when she watches a movie because the pain goes away, and the romance gives her that little bit more of dopamine that washes all the pain away. @PERSON3 and I grew closer after watching this movie. Now I hardly see movies with @CAPS4 friends because I always watch them with @CAPS4 sister. It was really fun that one day that we watched that movie. The help ofThe @CAPS1 @CAPS2 with the actors, the laughter, and the romance truly brought @CAPS4 sister and I together. We stopped fighting and arguing, and we watched a movie that will always be a top favorite of mine. That movie has changed @CAPS4 sister because now she doesn't feel pain for long, and she always thanks me for it each time because she knows how much I want to see her happy.",43.0,7.0
8,"When I was younger, a newcomer to middle school and as a twelve year old, I didn't know what to expect for my years at @ORGANIZATION1. What I did know was that I wanted to excel in joining new groups for sports, grades, and friends. I was an average student that got nervous about how well I would do for grades and what the people would be like before I started middle school. I could already picture loads of homework and more drama. It saddened me to see that my close friends were off to a different middle school and I was no longer in elementary where I felt as if I was on top of the world, when everything came easy from sports to tests. I had been in classic soccer for the past few years and had to incorporate that into my time as well. I was glad to see that somethings didn't change. I had also decided to join my church youth group to get involved and even join cross country to help out with my soccer skills. The thought of being busy actually made me quite happy knowing I was going to be with people my age most of the time. I had soccer games on the week ends, practice @DATE1 and @DATE2, cross-country running everyday after school @DATE4 through @DATE5, and youth group on @DATE1 nights. I tried my best to have a positive attitude, after all, my years at elementary school were great how could this be any different? Cross country was a new challenge for that got me excited. There was competition I never experienced before and more motivational competition. It had also made me better in soccer, which was a big payoff. Once I started doing races I only wanted to get better in my times, and once I succeed, that just motivated me even more. I loved the feeling I got and the energy it gave me to do just about anything. I became more excited about soccer so I could run even more and get better. The days that I went from cross-country to soccer were the best because cross-country just got me hyped for soccer. Soccer then got me hyped for youth group that started at seven. I even had a girl on my team that also went straight to youth group too, so carpooling with her was fun. Things seemed to be going well in the athletic department, but time was soon catching and it became harder to keep up with school. I would have to come straight home from whatever I was doing and start on my homework. I had also started to get distant from friends and not having time for them really killed my mood. I loved talking on the phone discussing school and getting to know people. I even missed hanging out with my friends on the weekends. Spending time with them was kind of like therapy for me, I could tell them anything about life and just plain have fun. I began to get tired of being booked all the time and never having time to relax. I was stressed beyond what I could handle. One day after my cross-country, soccer, and youth group, I thought I would have time for my homework but ended up staying up way too late to the point of exhaustion. It was hard for me to enjoy anything anymore. I decided that I needed a break so on @DATE3 I would spend time with one of my close friends. We went to her house and also went to the towns pool for some fun. We talked about everything from school to home life. We joked a lot about the little things we did and I found myself laughing more.  I remembered that laughing is that good feeling when nothing matters but enjoying yourself. I knew that I needed this. Now every time i have a stressful week I make plans to hang with friends and just enjoy myself. Laughter is the best medicine because its nothing you can make or prescribe, but something every human has the ability to do that can make life a little bit more livable and not take everything so serious.",38.0,6.0
8," Every nationality speaks the language of laughter, uniting the nations as one world. I like to believe that just one minute of pure laughter can cure us of even our worst heartaches. Even with my young eyes, I have seen this one little gesture do wonders in the world and I believe with all of my heart that it is a significant part in any relationship. I once heard someone say, ""A picture's worth a thousand words, but laughter is worth a lifetime of conversations."" Laughter brings friends close and families closer.  I have had an experience that ironically reflects my thoughts on laughter better than I could have planned. My best friend was recently taking a medication for her seizures that had an eerie side effect: memory loss. After taking this new medicine that had been prescribed to her for a little while, her dad started to notice changes in the way she was acting. Her words were getting mixed up and she could hardly think and talk at the same time without getting completely confused or acquiring a headache. By that night, every experience she has had in the past year and a half was gone. She was afraid and I desperately wanted to help her and comfort her. It was as if she had just moved to @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, even though she came in @DATE1. Laughter in her house didn't come around often anymore; she was too busy getting back on her feet and trying to find out what happened to her memory. Two days after this unfortunate event took place in her household, she wanted me to go visit her at her house at lunch time. She wasn't allowed on school campus because the school was afraid that her inability to remember her classmates that she has grown so close to would upset some of her friends. My dad picked me up in his truck and we drove off to meet my best friend. It is the strangest feeling to be so close to someone, and they don't have a clue who you are or what you mean to them. I wanted so badly to joke around and reminisce on old memories, but she was incapable remembering any times we spent together. She didn't know who I was, and that scared me. My dad and I finally arrived, him waiting as I approached her house which was now eerie with unfamiliar silence. I walked inside as if it was my own home, not thinking about the fact that she didn't know who I was or what I looked like. Her house was the same as it had always been; cozy and inviting. I inhaled and immediately recognized that all too familiar scent of fresh food and brown sugar. Nothing had changed, until she came down the stairs. Her father and I stood side by side as she descended down the stairway as a princess would make her grand entrance at a ball. I looked at her with deep admiration and realized that she was the same as she had always been. The mismatched socks and familiar clothes fooled me into thinking she was back to normal for only a moment, then, I saw her expression. Confusion and worry spread across her face as she realized there was a stranger in her house, and she didn't know who they were. Her dad began to explain how I was the best friend she ever had and she could tell me anything, and as this was happening she gave me the most disturbing look I have ever experienced; pure discomfort to be around me. As they talked, I wished she would suddenly come back, and things would be as they used to be, but she didn't. As we started talking, I was trying as hard as I could to act as I normally would because any little gesture I make could be familiar to her and jog her memory. I reached for a hug and she abruptly stopped. She began to tell me about how my hair smelled familiar to her, and we started laughing. This few minutes of laughter made my whole experience with meeting my best friend happier. It made remember the times back when she knew who I was and we would spend countless days laughing and messing around. She was still the same on the inside, and that gave me a refreshing glimmer of hope. To this day, she still doesn't remember who I am, but I am thankful for the times we spent together, laughing and just being ourselves. Even though the times can get rough and you might think that nothing can fix how you are feeling at the moment, laughter always has helped me when I needed it the most. Laughing can cure the unthinkable, and it can express so much about who you are and where you come from. Even if the laughter is not your own, knowing someone else is joyous ought to make your day that much better. I believe that laughter and happiness are a cure.",39.0,6.0
8," A few days ago my family and I went up to a place called @ORGANIZATION1. My aunt owns it, and every year closes it down and holds a family reunion that we all gather at. Its out in the middle of nowhere and a few hours away with no cell phone reception, so from the start I could tell this wasn't going to be a easy trip. Being stuck in the middle of nowhere with nobody to talk to, but old people and no cell service isn't easy I tell you what! When we arrived, we were greated with this nasty food she claimed it was soup, but I had never tasted soup that foul before in my life. The horror and nightmares that my aunts cooking gave me still gives me terrors today. She assigns rooms for every single person that comes and this year I had the lucky honer to share a bed with my mother, it was kind of lame. I went on a walk down by the river with my mom, and got aten alive by the misquetos to say the least and then almost fell down the hill while trying to return up to the main part of @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 where they were serving orderves. I was so hungry, but I did not by any means want to touch another one of anything that my aunt cooked, let alone put it in my mouth and eat it.  Soon after the orderves we had dinner, the dinner was not too bad but it was still pretty awful and I would not eat it again even if I was paid too. During the time that people were eating, my two year old nephew, was running and chasing these other girls and tripped and fell down the cement stairs and got a huge knot on his head and a fat cut by his eye. So I am sure by now that the assumption can be made that this @DATE1 that the reunion was held was not the best of weekends, nor my favorite family reuinons but this was by far not the end of the troubles that happened. After the gathering of people getting together for dinner we eventually parted and went back to our rooms that we had.  Along with no cell phone resecption there was no wifi or telivision, so my mom had brought her laptop to watch a movie on to help pass the time. It was a new movie that ad just came out, I was pretty exicted to watch it but of course, something had to happen so we could not watch it. It said that she had to download some program from the internet and there was no internet at @ORGANIZATION1. I tried to pass the hours by taking a shower, with shampoo still in my hair, the water started to run cold after only about five minutes of being in it. So that attempt to pass the time was a failed attempt. Thankfully I had brought my @CAPS1 touch with me and just had downloaded some games to play. Not too long after turning it off, it died. Finally ending the night I went to and laid in bed only to find it was like laying on a brick. The bed was one of the most uncomforable beds I have ever tried to sleep in, in my life.  The next morning went a little better, until the car ride to come home, but I will get to that in a little bit. We woke up and ate breakfast around nine, everyone was up at the dining room and it was all going well so far, but as soon as I started to think it was going well things changed. Breakfast was french toast on french bread made by one of the most annoying people I have ever met in my life, I am not sure how she is related to me but all I can say is thank goodness that this reunion was ending right after we all had ate. She served up my plate and I can noy eat if my food is touching so I said I would serve my own plate, but of course she insisted on doing it and pourposly made everything touch together it seemed like. I had finally found a food that was not repulsing and she ruined that for me.  Leaving as soon as we were done eating, I jumped in the car as fast as I could. I rode with my brother, his girlfriend, and my nephew. My nephew kept going to the bathroom and making the car smell disgusting and made me gag because I had to sit right next to him, and my brothers girlfriend just does not seem to say anything intellignet. We had to pull over to rest areas plenty of times to change my nephews dipar and one of the times my brother got poop on my seat where he was changing the dipar and I didn't notice until it was to late. Worst trip ever!",35.0,6.0
8," Have you laughed today? This @MONTH1 sound like an unusual question, but it's something that you should ask yourself quite often because it could help you out in the long run. I believe that laughter is the basis of any form of relationship whether it @MONTH1 be a friendship, boyfriend/girlfriend, or family relationship. Laughter helps mold and fix bonds, connections, and creates more memories and stories that you and the person you are with can laugh about later on in life. With laughter you can tell what kind of sense of humor a person has because you know the type of humor that the person likes and that can help you make more friends.  When you are laughing you are generally a happy-go-lucky person and enjoy who you are with. Laughter can cause something to evolve such as a friendship could form into a romantic relationship or a family member could become your best friend. According to some research, you can tell if someone likes you if the person laughs at your jokes even if they are really dumb jokes. Although, laughter @MONTH1 not always be a sign of happiness and joy, it @MONTH1 just be a way of someone hiding the way that they actually feel. Either way laughter can be really helpful when you do or @CAPS1't have anyone. Laughter has the ability to connect two people even closer and allow them to get to know each other even more and help them become closer.   One night I was going to spend the night at my friend @PERSON1' house. We were just hanging out in her room, watching music videos, and practically falling asleep because it wasn't exactly the most exciting thing that a teenager could or would want to do. All of a sudden this video popped up that had a bunch of little kids in it and it sparked a conversation. We just started talking about how we wish we were kids again because things were a lot easier. Then we started sharing our childhood memories no matter if they were good or bad. Granted that a majority of them were good memories and they made us laugh. Karrine and I spent the whole night sharing stories and laughing the whole time because of our stories, and even though we hadn't been together to experience each others childhoods, it felt as though we had been because we had shared so much in a certain amount of time that it just got stuck in each others heads. Whenever we hang out now we always laugh about the stories especially the one where I thought that pennies were worth the same amount as dollars and I tried to pay for the groceries when my mom and I had gone to the store. She was reaching into her purse to get the money out and I lifted my tiny toddler hand and said to her ""@CAPS1't worry mom, I've got this."" That story could make us laugh for days and sometimes it did. We hangout a lot more now hoping to tell each other more stories so we could have a good laugh. Laughing really helped out our friendship because before we didn't really talk that much or hangout as often as we do, and laughing really strengthened our friendship. Laughter was a very big and very important part of that, we are now best friends because we enjoy being with each other and we get along a whole lot better then other people.  Once you actually take the time to think about it you will realize that some, if not all, of your closest friends are the people that make you laugh. That's completely understandable because why would you want to hang out with a negative @PERSON2 or a temper mental @CAPS2? The thing is you wouldn't want to unless arguing and crying is your thing. You want to hang out with people that help you with your problems when you are confused, help you out when you are on the verge of tears, give you advice when you have a major or minor dispute with the boyfriend or girlfriend, but most importantly you want a friend that can make you laugh and smile.  Picture your life being like a building, the wood and building blocks would be your friends and experiences, and the laughter would be the cement or glue that holds everything in place. Without the cement being there, the building would eventually crumble all the way to the ground and cause frustration because you'd have to rebuild it. Laughter increases happiness and your life span and with a longer life you can surely laugh a whole lot more. Laughing about things is healthy, learn not to sweat the small stuff, and make sure that smiling and laughing are a part of your daily routine.",41.0,7.0
8,My teacher @PERSON1 is always laughing at me because I am funny to laugh at. She always wants to laugh until I say something funny she laughs then. @PERSON1 loves to laugh at kids and teachers and I think that is mean. Someone should laugh back at her and say do you like it when other people do it to you. Then she says yes I do and then she laugh at the person who laughed at her. Someone should tell her that laughing at people is rude and mean. She went on laughing at us teens and after she left I said we should laugh back at so she would feel like us when she laughs at us teens. So us teens made @PERSON1 meet us and then we laughed at so hard that she was laughing back at us and then I laughed as loud as I can. Then she laughed even louder then I did. So I laughed at her so hard that I couldn't breath . I kept on laughing at her and she kept laughing at me. By the time we were done laughing she fell silent then I laughed at her again and everbody joined in with me at laughing at @PERSON1. Then we fell silent and the she laughed at us again. She laughed for a long time and when she was done us kids started laughing at her again. Then all of a sudden she laughed as louder then all of us kids. Then she fell silent again and us kids laughed even louder than her. Then she laughed the loudest. Then us kids laughed the most loudest at her. But she will never stop laughing at us kids and staff. Then us kids and adults laughed at her so hard that she could hardly laugh at us. Then the mayor join with us at laughing at @PERSON1. but she kept on laughing at us. Then all of a sudden the whole world joined us kids and adults laughing at her. But that wasn't good enough. Then martians joined and then polar bears joined. Then every single animal joined us kids and adults. But she kept on laughing at us. Then everybody including the animals kept on laughing harder then her. But I guess that was not going to stop her . Then robots joined with us and she was still laughing at us. We kept on laughing at her.But she kept on laughing at us. Then we finally laughed as loud as we could and she laughed as loud as she could .Then we laughed even louder than her. But she kept on laughing. So we finally laughed as louder then we could and finally she stop laughing and I told her that laughing at people is mean and rude.,33.0,6.0
8,"                                Laughter! Never regret something that once made you smile. That is one of my all time favorite quotes. You @MONTH1 wish you would of done something differently. @CAPS4 at the time you were having fun. @CAPS2's kind of like those middle school love relationships. Your only dating a day, and you @CAPS6 your madly in love with the person. @CAPS4 then next week when you break up you tell everyone that you hated them, and never really liked them. That's exactly why things in middle school @CAPS1 don't work out. Life is full of experiences, some better then others. I like to think back on the good experiences more often then the bad though. Especially the ones, where I was laughing till I cried. When I'm with my friends, were always having a good time. My friend @PERSON1 and I have so much fun when were together. We try telling people what we did over the @DATE1. We can barely tell the stories we're laughing so hard. I always here my parents talking about there high school days. Telling old stories, and they can't help @CAPS4 laugh at them. Or even looking at their old yearbooks. They laugh at there ridiculous hair cuts, or there outfit choices. The point I'm trying to make is, never regret things. @CAPS2's better to @CAPS1 laugh things off. I bet you when were in are thirties thinking back on all are high school memories were going to be laughing are butts off. We're teenagers, we're supposed to do stupid things, @CAPS7 okay not to stupid of things. @CAPS4 we should at least be having a good time. My dad always says  ""@CAPS1 laugh @CAPS2 off."" @CAPS2 took me awhile to realize what he meant by that. @CAPS2's kind of like the saying. ""@CAPS1 shake @CAPS2 off"" @CAPS4 I purifier to @CAPS6 ""@CAPS1 laugh @CAPS2 off."" @CAPS6 you're walking in front of a group of very attractive young men, and you trip. How embarrassing would that be? I'd have to @CAPS6 very! Now if you @CAPS1 started laughing instead of running off crying. I'm sure the boys woulds think @CAPS2 was much cooler that you @CAPS1 laughed @CAPS2 off, and wasn't a big baby who ran off crying.  Laughter is also one of things that distinguishes you from others. Everyone has a different laugh. Some loud, some quiet. Like for intestine I have a few laughs. I have my fake laugh, my ""oh yeah that's kinda funny"" laugh, my "" @CAPS7 that's awkward"" laugh, then my real laugh when I actually find something amusing, and then the laugh that I'm laughing so hard I'm not even making a noise. Laughter is a very special trait. I know some people who never laugh. And @CAPS7 there pretty boring people, they don't have many friends. Then I know some people who are always laughing, and there always surrounded by a group of people. @CAPS1 remember never regret something that once made you smile. Your life is going to be much more fun , if you laughing through @CAPS2.",33.0,6.0
8," I don't think the importance of laughter will ever be completely understood, even though it's an unconcious action. Laughter is a right of passage, being able to laugh and have a good time brings people together. Laughter bring you and others around you together. Topics to laugh about are limitless. If you really focused on the things you laugh about its kind of dumbfounding. Example:what you see, how things/people look or act, what people say, the possibilites are endless.   When I'm with my friends i always seem to laugh more. One friend in particular, her name is @CAPS1. She has a couple of acres of land, one time we decided to take her quad out for a spin. Keep in mind that this was my first time on a quad. I got a chance to drive, and i jumped at the opportunity! @CAPS1 and i were laughing and smiling the whole time. what an adventure it was. We happened to stumble upon a small hill. We swiched drivers and @CAPS1 floored it over the hill.   The next thing i knew, i was lying on the ground. I was so dizzy I started to laugh! I had never blacked out before and it was a feeling i had never experianced before. I felt like i was in my own world. Suddenly @CAPS1 was screaming my name! I staggered twords her and realized she was in trouble! Her leg had somehow gotten caught in the quad when we went over the hill! Her whole entire head was stuck underneath the quad!! thankfully we were both wearing helmets, but hers squished her face up and i couldent help but laugh! What was i to do?! Being the hero that i am, i raced to her and lifted the quad up off her head before she was a goner! There wasn't much damage, only a few bruises. I soon realized that my phone had gone missing, we spent the next @NUM1 hours searching through the field for it. what a day. There are a few details that i enjoy: @CAPS1 has an unreal house that could probably fit a small country and none of her @NUM2 family members whitnessed anthing that just happened. Also, when we tried pushing the quad up the almost non-exhistant hill, we couldent, although i lifted the whole thing off of her head uphill..ironic.  What im trying to get at here is that in every bad situation, you can always find a little bit of humor somewhere. You just have to look hard enough. It dosent matter how bad it is, for example, you break your arm. It's kind of funny if you think about how you broke it! Some situations are special, like in the case of a family member dying. There really is no funny way to look at that. You can think of the funny times you had with that person or their own sense of humor. You can't live life without laughter.",36.0,6.0
8,"Making someone laugh is a talent that any person can acquire, it just depends what that certain person finds humorous, but then there are people that can make you laugh in any condition. I have friend that is one of those people, the kind of person that can make you laugh no matter what, but his gift comes at price of ignorance, being close to completely oblivious, and he lacks reason, making him a difficult person to communicate with but also making him a perfect center for any joke or prank. So one evening after school when just about everyone had cleared out of the freshman hall except for only a couple of my friends and I, we formed a small circle in the middle of the hallway; where we were discussing something in a state of importance that I don't even care to remember, when our good friend the joker decides to join us. After awhile he decided to tell us all a joke that he had heard recently based off of @ORGANIZATION1 recent scandal. When he started telling the joke every single one of us was listening intently, until about half way through the story we see a teacher approaching us from behind my friend that was telling the joke. Without him noticing that there was a teacher standing close by listening to our conversation and just out of sight of him, my friend continues his joke. The rest of the listeners and I knowing our friend very well, knew that he was going to say something very explicit in front of the teacher by the end of the story. The anticipation of waiting to hear what my friend was about to say, that i saw on the rest of my friend's faces was to much to bare that I could have started laughing without the joke even being over, but I kept my cool to the end. By the time the teacher had walked up in the middle of the story, everyone that had noticed his presents and had stopped listening to the story until the very end where my friend let loose the unknown explicit words that we had been waiting for. As my friend stood there laughing at his joke by himself for a few moments and looking for approval of the joke that he just told, everyone was silent, and the teachers eyes were wide and his jaw hung open.  My friend stood there confused to why no one else was laughing until he realized that there was someone behind him that he didn't want to have heard the joke, and as he turned around to see who it was the expression on his face changed instantly.  By this time the rest of us were rolling on the ground because we were laughing so hard, and our joker was being talked to by the teacher. After we wiped the tears of laughter from our eyes we asked what the teacher said and he just said nothing. To this day we still talk about what had taken place that day, and no matter what, thinking of that day makes us laugh. Although me telling you this story is not even close to how funny it actually was.",37.0,6.0
8,"  Throughout time, it's been said that laughter is the best medicine, and although that @MONTH1 seem a bit silly, it also seems believable. Laughter is an incredibly universal thing, unlike language, since different forms of it can't be understood by all. That's why when someone said ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" it was absolutely true. Things like laughter and smiles are something that everyone is familiar with, no matter what language they speak or where they come from, so it's essential to being social.  There are not many stories that people can tell that are specifically about the laughter, but more that the laughter revolves around what was said or what happened. Thinking about places with a lot of laughter, one could imagine big family gatherings where old stories are shared or a group of friends just hanging out wherever and having a good time. In any case, it's almost always a good thing. Not too long ago, while I was walking with a group of friends, I wasn't paying much attention to my footing at all, so my shoe slipped into a crack in the sidewalk and I started to fall, almost hitting the concrete face first. While it was slightly scary and would have hurt really badly had I not caught my balance, everyone laughed about it afterward, including myself. I think it's important to be able to laugh at the little things, because you have to be able to laugh at life sometimes. If I hadn't laughed at myself, the whole situation would have just felt strange and out of place.  You can instantly feel more comfortable around someone if you laugh together about anything, because there is less of a sense of insecurity on either part. Laughter is warm, inviting and tends to make people seem instantly more likeable because they seem like someone who likes to have fun. In tense or awkward situations, the funny person who is always making jokes is a real stress reliever, because the laughter often cuts through the tension. Without laughter, you could never really be as close to people, because laughter almost always signifies a good things. If you have a good time with people, you'd obviously want to be around them more, so it leads to stronger friendships. When you later reminisce on times with a lot of laughter, they are obviously good memories, things that were happy.  Laughter is not only essential to being social, but essential to everything. It leads to better relationships and happier people. Looking back, people should not see the times of gloom and sadness that they endured, but they should always remember the best times they had.

8," Laughter is important to us all. It keeps smiles on all our faces, even when times get hard.  I had a great grandfather whom we called ""@CAPS1 @PERSON1"". He was the kindest person I'd ever been lucky enough to call a part of my family. He lived next to @LOCATION1, straight across a field, where we could see the @NUM1 of @DATE2 fireworks light up the sky right in our own backyard. I thought that was the coolest thing in the world, and would brag to all my friends about how I had the greatest grandpa ever, just because he lived so close. When I was six years old he had us come down and took us to @LOCATION1, that was the last time I got to see him before he died.  In @DATE3, he died suddenly of a heart attack. We didn't find out for a while after, because he did not live here. His funeral was set for the @NUM2 of @DATE1, a week after we'd found out he had past away, and we planned to attend accordingly. I had went out and bought a nice dress for the funeral because I felt I needed to be dressed up. My mother and sister did the same.  A week had past and we were on our way to @LOCATION2 by plane. I was grounded at the time so I was arrogant about going at all, being away from my friends to go to a sad funeral was not what I wanted to be doing. To make matters worse, my mom was yelling at me the whole ride to my grandpa's house about respect and to remind me that we were doing this because we loved him, and it was important to my family. So, I settled and was quiet as we pulled into the drive-way. Upon entering his home, I was shocked at how many people were there. I realized how much I loved and missed him. Tears began streaming down my face, I walked into the corner of the kitchen, and sat by myself for a while.  Though I had been there before I hadn't seen his whole house. There were rooms full of history and memories of his life. I learned about my family from before my grandparents were even born! It was all so new to me. Then came the sad part of the funeral. At first, no one there seemed sad at all. But, now came the time to look back on his life. I dreaded this part more than anything. Oh, how I longed to be anywhere but there. First up to speak was my grandpa, his adopted son. He had made a spectacular poster, filled with pictures of himself and @CAPS1 @PERSON1. He told the tale of how he came to be his son and how @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was always there for him through thick and thin. Not an eye was dry after my grandpa's speech. I was ready to leave after that, for I could not stand all of the sadness that filled the entire room. Yet, I had to remain seated and listen out of respect for my family. After my grandpa, came one of @CAPS1 @PERSON1's long-time friend/business partners. I expected another story that would make us all begin crying over again, but I was wrong. His speech was of the great life he had lived. According to him, my @CAPS1 @PERSON1 was a bit of a ladies man. Man, what a life he had; girls, money, cars. Things I should have figured out by exploring his home, though, it seemed as if he wasn't gone hearing it from a person who had actually lived it with him. The mood of the whole ceremony turned completely around. There were people laughing and reminiscing the life he had. I learned so many new things about my grandpa that day. Then, after that, the thought of him being gone didn't bring me to tears anymore. In fact, I smiled. I believe that's how my @CAPS1 would've wanted it. Without the humor brought to the remembrance of @CAPS1 @PERSON1; my family would still be mourning over him. We miss him, very much, but I know he wouldn't be happy if we didn't look back and smile upon remembering him as the fun-loving and giving person he was.  ",41.0,7.0
8," Laughter is like medicine. When your feeling down or just having a bad day, laughter can turn that around in seconds. Its fun to laugh, laughing brightens everything. Without laughter life would be dark, depressing and sad. Laughing is an amazing feeling. My best friend @CAPS1 makes me laugh all the time. Non-stop laughing for hours. @CAPS1 and I have made @CAPS6 many memories that involve laughter. I don't even think i can name them all, but there is one that i will never forget. It was @DATE1 @TIME1 and I was already very bored. I wanted to go to my friends house, but I knew my parents were not going to let me. They were already in a bad mood from my brothers who hadn't cleaned their room in forever. Suddenly an idea popped into my head. What if i cleaned their room for them. Then my parents will defiantly let me go. @CAPS6 I talked to my mom and she was thrilled. Their room hadn't been cleaned in months. It wasn't a pigs sty, it was worse. Their room looked like a tornado had swept through it about a million times. It was @CAPS6 messy my mom even agreed that she would pay me and my friend thirty dollars to clean the room. @CAPS6 I called my friend and asked her to come help me clean my brothers room. I warned her about what it looked like, but she still agreed to come help me.  @CAPS1 arrived and we were ready to clean @PERSON1's and @CAPS2's room. We walked into the room and she could not believe how messy it was. She saw it and exclaimed, ""@CAPS3 is going to take us hours to clean!"" We didn't know @CAPS7 to begin, @CAPS6 we started with the big stuff. The blankets were thrown everywhere, @CAPS6 we picked those up and folded them. Then we went on to the dirty clothes. After that came the toys and random junk. We just shoved all of @CAPS3 into boxes, then shoved all of the boxes into one of my brothers closets. I vacuumed, then we made the beds. The room looked amazing. It was a miracle that my brothers room was finally clean. It only took me and @CAPS1 three hours.  I ran down the stairs yelling, "" @CAPS5! @CAPS5! You have to come see @CAPS3!"" @CAPS6 he slowly walked up the steps and finally he opened the door to my brothers room. My dads jaw dropped. He could not believe how clean it was. He was astonished. He went inside the room and was surprised when he had floor space to walk. Then he asked the question that i had been dreading, ""@CAPS7 did you guys put all of there stuff?"" That's when we smiled and had suspicious looks in our eyes. He knew @CAPS7 we had put all of the stuff. He started walking towards the closet. I yelled, "" @CAPS8 @CAPS5 don't open that!"", but it was to late. Everything sprung out of my brothers closet and my @CAPS5 was buried. It was hilarious. Seeing that was like something you would see in a cartoon. We pulled stuff off of him while laughing. My friend laughed @CAPS6 hard she peed her pants. Then because of that we laughed harder and we couldn't stop. My @CAPS5 even joined in on laughing and that doesn't happen often.  Laughter really is an important part of everything. Laughter can make even the dullest of things adventurous. My friend and I both hate cleaning, but seeing my @CAPS5 buried in all that junk was defiantly worth it. Having those moments of laughter made everything that day better. Laughter can cure even the worst of moods. Laughter brings people together. It helps make friendships. Laughter is an important part of life.",40.0,7.0

As the days passed @CAPS5 @PERSON2 grew, she began to show interest in what her big sister was doing. @PERSON3 however resented @PERSON2 because @CAPS9's attention was on her. @PERSON5 as we nicknamed her, began to @CAPS8 @CAPS5 be very vibrant as her sister used to be, accept she had yet to say her first words. @PERSON3's reaction to this surprised us all she didn't join in @CAPS5 try to play but rather pushed her little sister away. She wanted nothing to do with her @CAPS5 she let @CAPS9 know that. The days kept passing @CAPS5 @PERSON5 was growing like crazy she began to walk but still no words or even attempted words. @CAPS9 tried to include @PERSON3 in on all of her sisters learning but she just pushed us away. I started just watching @PERSON3 @CAPS5 seeing @CAPS4 she reacted to things. I found out that @CAPS7 ""no one"" was looking @PERSON3 would try @CAPS5 interact with @PERSON5 but she wasn't quite sure @CAPS4. While I was babysitting the two girls one day I asked @PERSON3 to help me with something @CAPS5 she said yes right away but @CAPS7 the job I asked her to do was to hold her sister she was nervous. I asked @PERSON3 to do this once or twice every time I had them over @CAPS5 each time @PERSON3 would look at her baby sister @CAPS5 smile. I thought that this might help @PERSON3 with wanting to be around @PERSON5 more @CAPS5 to eventually start playing again maybe to become herself again. It hadn't been working, weeks passed by @CAPS5 still @PERSON3 didn't really want to play with her sister. I guess I had kind of given up. One early morning both the girls were in the living room watching television, @PERSON5 in the play pen @CAPS5 @PERSON3 on the couch, or at least that's @CAPS4 I left them. I was standing in the kitchen getting @PERSON5's bottle @CAPS7 I heard a @CAPS8, it was @PERSON3,@CAPS7 I walked into the living room to find @PERSON3 in the playpen with her sister laughing @CAPS5 playing with toys. I smiled @CAPS5 asked,""@CAPS4 does it feel to @CAPS8 again @PERSON3?"" @CAPS5 she smiled @CAPS5 replied, ""@CAPS6 @PERSON4 my cheeks hurt, but, I'm so glad sissy taught me @CAPS4 to @CAPS8 again."" @CAPS7 @PERSON3 @CAPS5 @PERSON5 were picked up that night their parents were amazed to see both the girls laughing. @PERSON5 looked up at her mom @CAPS5 said, ""@CAPS8."" @CAPS9 in the family teases @PERSON3 now that she was supposed to teach @PERSON5 @CAPS4 to @CAPS8 not the other way around but that made the day made @PERSON3 @CAPS5 @PERSON5 best friends.",44.0,7.0
8," One sunny afternoon around three o'clock there was this scrathing sound on the wall of my bedroom, and my friends and I had no clue what it had to be. Everyone was in the room nobody else was home as we looked every where that the sound could be coming from the dog, the cat, and still couldn't figure it out. But everytime we had gotten up out of my room the strange disterbing noise would stop. As we would proceed with the activities of just being girls in my room laughing, talking about boys, and painting our nails we would hear it again, but it only would happen when we would start laughing at each other as if something that was said was funny which usually wasn't just so hyper that anything anyone of us said we would burst into laughs. But then we start laughing at some silly joke when the noise in the wall kept on going. So we got up again and looked every where which then it had stopped. Alright so now we are actually getting kinda scared because we don't know what the heck this sound is. We kept thinking the worst like is something in the house is the dog here, is the cat here we did not know what it could be and at this momment we were all freaked out.  As we went back into my room to watch some television when we all fell off the bed and started laughing so hard that most of us were crying like it was raining outside. Then we heard it, the sound it had to be coming from outside so all of us grabbed shoes and headed outside. We were so scared we looked like a ball all cuddled up together as we were walking in a huge group. So as we are heading outside laughing we could still hear the sound so we start running trying to findout what the heck it is before it stops. As we are being super quiet it stops again so we had to back insided after looking for about an hour we headed inside to finish our television show that was almost over when the t.v. turned off all by itself. As that happened now we were all scared. I think someone is trying to pull a prank on us but yet everyone was laughing when the t.v. shut off. I didn't think that it was too funny myself but since we were laughing the horrible sounding noise started again and again we looked harder this time and still couldn't figure out what it was. We were getting so frustrated that we wanted to just stop trying. We looked looked and looked. We couldn't figure out what it was, but then I got a idea one of my friends said we can all start laughing it be a fake laughing and go all around the house. We can split up so everyone split in different rooms. I wasn't to sure because I didn't want to get scared but maybe this was a good idea. When we all split up we started laughing then the television turned back on as we were hearing this disturbing sound still we kept looking and looking. I thought to myself we are never going to figure out this sound I hope my parents come home soon! As we heard the loudest scream ever we all race into my bedroom where the scream came from and it was just my friend and my little sister. We had no clue she had been hiding in there all this time and was messing with us. We thought she left with my mom to the store but I guess we were wrong atleast it wasn't some scary monster and we were all safe. As we finished the show my sister scared us again and we all began laughing that a six year old scared the crap out of seventeen year @NUM1",37.0,6.0

First I was getting ready to go outside to ride a motorcycle than my little nephew and brother saw me so they wanted to come with me. I left outside with them I went for one of the motorcycle I got them on and I was holding my nephew from the back so he fall. Then we were just going around the house for a little while, so we got bored then we headed tours the road so than we were riding around. It was really fun and later my brother came out and he was getting ready to get on the motorcycle and he headed to the road with us, and we were just outside riding our motorcycles. Second of all, my mom came out she told us to go inside because we were going to eat so we left and ate we waited for a little while, I left outside with my brothers and my little nephew so we got on the motorcycles and headed to the road my little brother was going fast and I was holding on to my little nephew and I kept on telling him to slow down because he was going to drop our nephew, but he still didn't listen so I took my nephew off the motorcycle and he started to cry so I had to put him back on the motorcycle so he can stop crying then my other brother came and got mad because our little brother kept going really fast so he slapped him in the back so he can slow down, but still wouldn't slow down so he left really fast and he called @PERSON1 a bad name he was trying to catch, but he had his motorcycle off and he couldn't turn it on and he looked really funny cause he didn't have a shirt on just a blanket and when he was trying to turn on the motorcycle the blanket would go back and it looked like if he was trying to fly but with one hand and I just kept on laughing I almost dropped my little nephew because I was laughing so hard, but my little brother kept on going really fast so I was tired of him not slowing down I just told him to stop the motorcycle and I graved my nephew and just left home walking but I was still laughing. Then when I got home my mom asked me why was I laughing I told her the story she was laughing to. ",36.0,6.0

There are many times recently that laughter has proven to be the shortest distance between people. During this year @CAPS8 friend @PERSON1 and I became very close after fighting a lot over the @DATE1 and past years. Our friendship grew over our love of laughing. What ever the two of us are doing it involves some kind of laughter.  @PERSON1 invited me over to her house right @CAPS12 eight grade started to hang out. When I got over there we talked for what seemed like hours. Once we had kind of warmed up to each other again we decided to make music videos to our favorite choir songs, ""@CAPS4 of the @CAPS5"" and ""@CAPS6 the @CAPS7"". We had her camera propped up in her kitchen and played the songs really loud on her speakers while we danced and sang along.  This got boring quickly and we decided to make brownies. @PERSON1 and I were having a grand time together acting like little kids again, but these brownies were to good to pass by. @CAPS10 we baked I realized the camera was still on, I ran to shut it off @CAPS12 it captured anything embarrassing. The brownies were mixed after two minutes of vigorous stirring. We then ate the batter @CAPS10 we poured in the well oiled pan quickly shoved them in the oven and ran off.  We ran down the hall to the entryway and found ourselves laying on the heated floor talking again. This time instead of chatting about our feuds and how we've been, we got into the girl stuff like boys and the latest gossip. Neither of us liked any boys or knew the gossip (we were both very out of the loop) so we quickly changed subjects. The subject change led us no where so we whipped out our cell phones and played with the camera feature. This @MONTH1 seem lame but we experimented with many tricks of the camera, negative, black and white, the fun frames and had a great time. I took a picture of her camera in negative, @PERSON1 then took a picture in negative of @CAPS8 phone with the picture up. Her camera went back to @CAPS2 normal color. This amazed us so much, then realized how obvious it was and laughed @CAPS1 our selves. After a while we heard the timer go off, our brownies were done.  Just @CAPS10 fast @CAPS10 we ran out of the kitchen we ran back. While the brownies cooled we stayed in the kitchen to wait and I fell. I fell right to @CAPS8 bottom. In @CAPS8 head I remember slow motion running in one spot and because of @CAPS8 sock on hard wood contact I slipped. Once on the ground @PERSON1 was laughing and it wasn't too painful, so I joined her.   She exclaimed, ""That was the coolest thing ever!"" I had to agree, but I replied to her statement with a simple that-hurt-don't-make-fun-of-me look that she knows well. The brownies were finally cool enough to eat, we both had three large pieces. We made it back to her entryway with brownies in hand. There we continued to take pictures, the camera was set in black and white while we posed behind it with funny faces. Of course now we had to let our stomachs settle @CAPS12 tackling the trampoline.  We went outside to be the kids still inside from earlier. Playing the same games we played when were younger. These games even now seem to crack us up, with our now heavier weights making it almost impossible to jump. @PERSON1 and I were constantly falling down, scrambling to get back up, laughing @CAPS1 each others failed attempts @CAPS1 anything we tried. After trying so hard to stand up I gave up and stayed down to ask @PERSON1 a question.  ""@CAPS8 favorite movie isFinding @CAPS9, yours?"" @CAPS10 random @CAPS10 it sounds it sprung an interesting conversation. @PERSON1 started to say, ""@CAPS8 favorite little kid movie...""  @CAPS12 she could finish I interrupted saying thatFinding @CAPS9 was not @CAPS8 favorite little kid movie but @CAPS8 all time favorite. All we could do was laugh @CAPS1 her mistake. @CAPS1 the end of the day filled with tons of joy and laughter we said our good-byes most likely till school. Both of us knowing our friendship was saved because of this day. It was also saved because of our laughter. Hanging out with @PERSON1 was one of the many times laughter has proven to be the shortest distance between two people. I now know that the @CAPS3 way to heal or even recreate a friendship is by using laughter to connect two people together. I would have never learned this if we hadn't discovered our connection is laughter. To this day we laugh together @CAPS1 any moment we can, @CAPS1 truly anything that is remotely funny, or just because we are bored. Our friendship continues to have flaws, but in the end we get over it by sharing a laugh.",43.0,7.0
8," Laughter, bringing joy to many people all over the world. Big jolly faces filled with smiles from ear to ear, children playing on school yards, your family members sitting on the couch watching there favorite @CAPS1 shows. Laughter brings everyone together you laugh with your closest friends and family, bringing relationship between strangers closer. I bet what you find humerus a million other people do too! There is so many interest out in the world and laughter helps people find what they have in common. Laughter could also be a bad thing, but not to the person @CAPS2 of course, they're getting a kick out of it.  I love @CAPS2 personally, it feels good to me. I especially love @CAPS2 so hard that my belly hurts and my cheeks are sore, and you can't even hold yourself up any longer. These types of laughter I usually share with my best friend's @PERSON2 and @PERSON1. Even @CAPS7 we're in a bad mood we will always find something to make us laugh. Sometimes it's video or a song but most of the time it's just us being ourselves and making silly faces being dorks. The best types of friendships are always spent with long fun filled days of laughter, because we all know it's good for the soul (superstitiously.) @CAPS2 can also be shared with family members, my brother and I like to talk about our day and how it went. Most the time it ends with us @CAPS2 about what happened. He works at @CAPS3-@CAPS4 and I go to school at @CAPS5 @CAPS6, we talk about the people that make us mad and about the stupid mistakes that we made. The best part about that is, when taking a step back and looking at what was ""horrid"" but in reality wasn't bad at all.  Why I love just getting with a few friends cracking jokes left and right or watching funny movies @CAPS2 with tears coming from our eyes. Is honestly because it feels good, I feel better about myself and I'm comfortable around the people that I got to share a good belly laugh with. Those are truly in my opinion the best laughs, well other than when your so upset about something then just start @CAPS2 realizing, it never even mattered! Those are some reasons why I absolutely love @CAPS2, it makes everything just simply, alright again. But the down side about laughter is that some people find the wrong things to be @CAPS2 at. Example: @CAPS7 someone gets hurt or picked on some people find that amusing and funny when in all reality that's cruel and childish. Violence shouldn't ever be found amusing unless you're watching some type of horror movie but people don't laugh at those, so why do they in reality? Laughter @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be abused in some situations, but I believe that people should try to control inappropriate laughter.  I've had many fun good memories with laughter and those have been spent mostly with my best friend @PERSON2. We met one anther when we were only eight and nine, me being nine and her being eight. In time we realized that we really get along so her and her family invited me to a camping trip, I will never forget. We rode four wheelers all over the place, climbed trees like monkeys, and swam in lakes like ducks. But I think the funnest was when the sun went down, the grown ups got a little tipsy, and her grandpa asked me to dance. I was such a shy kid, but at least I learned how to swing dance with grandpa @CAPS8. Eventually we had to go to bed, so we climbed into our tent and told each others stories until everyone else fell asleep. Now here is when the real fun began, we decided now that the fire was gone and we couldn't see a thing. Not even @CAPS7 your hand was straight in front of your face. We turned on her lamp, knowing we'd get in trouble @CAPS7 we had left, so we found something entertaining for us to do, and that is when we started to play with shadow puppets. We made tons of silly looking creators that talked and chased one another. They were the funnest creators we have ever seen, but only one really seemed to stick. @CAPS9's, those were our favorite they were like dolls but they were your hand, imagine the doll you never lost. The childhood toy that will be there for the rest of your life. We played all night it seemed, @CAPS2 so hard it got hard to breathe, keep in mind we're only in a tent so we got yelled at and had to go to bed. That was the best memory of my childhood with @PERSON2 and our shadow puppets, the @CAPS9's.",41.0,7.0
8," Memorable @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4      One day when I was walking home from school, I got a random phone call from @CAPS21 @CAPS4 @PERSON1. It was a @DATE1. She wanted to know if I could come over to her house that day. I told her I didn'@CAPS12 know so I had to call her back to see if I could hang out or not. When I got home from walking home from school, I talked to @CAPS21 @CAPS5 about coming over. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 really likes @PERSON1 a lot. They get along well. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 didn'@CAPS12 know if I could go over to her house @DATE1 because she wanted me home. I let her think about what I should do. That night, @CAPS21 @CAPS5 gave me an answer to which if I could go over there or not and she said @CAPS19. I was so happy to actually go over there for the first time in a while. The last time I was there was on @CAPS8. So it was a while.   So that night, I waited until @NUM1 @CAPS9.M for her @CAPS5 to come pick me up because she was just getting off work. I was so excited to go because I haven'@CAPS12 been there in a while. Her @CAPS5 finally came and got me. I was so happy. When I finally got to @PERSON1's, she jumped on me because she hasn'@CAPS12 seen me in a while. I fell when she jumped on me. @PERSON1 just thought that was the most funniest thing ever. She even took a picture of me on the ground. That night, late, we were in her room hanging out, listening to music, and watching @CAPS12.V. We were up until @NUM2 in the morning making up funny jokes and stories. We were crazily laughing really loud that we woke her parents up. They told us to calm down, but we couldn'@CAPS12 because we were too busy having the time of our life! After they left, we still were having some fun. We started to be quiet a little bit, but then we realized we were being too loud again.    @NUM3 A.M came and we were still up laughing and having fun. ""@CAPS13, I never thought I could say this but I am crying @CAPS21 eyes out because I am really enjoying tonight!"" @PERSON1 said, joyfully. I was pretty happy she said that because it just was a nice thing to know that we were having fun and she liked it. ""I don'@CAPS12 think we could ever get bored tonight now."" I said. @PERSON1 is a fun person to hang out @CAPS2. She has the personality of a monkey! She's always so excited and I like that because of her. We finally gave up on having fun, and actually went to bed. We were exhausted and worn out because of all the fun we had. It was actually nice to have a good time like that @CAPS2 a good @CAPS4. We finally went to sleep and passed out.    Next morning came, and we were still very tired. We had to wake up for her brother's basketball game at @NUM4 o'clock. So yeah, you can tell we were very tired. I wanted to sleep in more, but we couldn'@CAPS12 because we had to go to his game to support his team. When we were going to his game, a really crazy song was on the radio that @PERSON1 did not like whatsoever. She told her @CAPS5 to turn it off, but she didn'@CAPS12 listen. @PERSON1 didn'@CAPS12 like this song because it was very annoying and she couldn'@CAPS12 stand listening to it. Her @CAPS5 finally turned it off because @PERSON1 was complaining about it. It was so funny what she was doing. I couldn'@CAPS12 stop laughing. We got to her brothers game just in time, and got ready for it to start. We were so bored during the whole process of sitting down and watching the game. @PERSON1 and I ended up walking back to her house because we got bored. Sadly, when we got back, I had to go home. I was sad because I didn'@CAPS12 want to go home, I wanted to stay @CAPS2 her longer. @CAPS21 @CAPS5 came and picked me up an hour after @PERSON1 and I walked back to her house. She came and got me, and asked me ""@CAPS17 was it? Did you have fun?"" All I said to @CAPS21 @CAPS5 was, ""@CAPS19 @CAPS5. I had the time of @CAPS21 life. It was amazing, I think I want to do it again!"" @CAPS21 @CAPS5 was wondering why I was so happy, then she finally realized. I had a lot of fun there @CAPS2 her.

8,"I love the mall. I've loved it from the first time I've been in one, and it has always been on my mental things-I-want-to-do-list. I remember clearly enough only one time I've laughed until I cried and beyond: it was one of the times I was in the mall.I was eight, maybe nine, and I was with my big sister by one of those wishing wells you supposedly toss a coin in, then watch it circle down until it reaches the hole - I still don't know what they're called. My sister was tossing coins in when two other girls came along and started chatting. We said this and that about the wishing well, the two strangers were tossing coins in too, trying to get them to circle the well just right. Trying but not succeeding. In the midst of it, along came a man who was curious about what we were doing. He tried to flip his coins in just right, too, but he did even worse than we did. His coins didn't even make it to the hole. He gave up and walked away. Then the funny part came. We girls started chatting again when one of them suddenly thought she should return the man his wasted jingle change. She grabbed it and chased after him. ""@CAPS1, you forgot your money!"" she called out in her high-pitched little-girly voice; ""@CAPS2! @CAPS1! @CAPS1! You forgot your money!"" All the people in sight turned around and looked at her as she made her sharade. Some took second glances and some kept staring. I started laughing. Look at her chasing after him, making that commotion, over the insignificant coins he didn't want! Look at the cute, ridiculous spectacle she's making! She put the money in the man's hand. I laughed harder. People switched stares and glances from me to her. My embarrassed sister tried to get me to shut up, but I only laughed the more. As the girl returned and saw me holding on to the well with tears streaming down my face, laughing my brains out, her face changed. She realized only then she had done something embarrassing. I laughed even harder. My sister tried to convince the girl that it wasn't a big deal as I kept on laughing. They made strained apologies to each other. The two girls were gone the next minute. I continued having bursts of laughter. For the rest of the day, I thought back to that scene by the wishing well and laugh out loud, out of the blue. The looks alone my sister gave me at my sudden fits through the mall were enough to make me laugh.     ",37.0,6.0

Making somebody laugh is the best medicine for them, if they are mad or sad. My friends @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 are friends that live with each other.They are also my baseball teammates. I give them rides home after practice everyday. They had they're stuff in the pick up before we went to practice and I was planning on taking off just to have fun with them after practice @CAPS7 I did. I locked my doors when I left @CAPS7 that they couldn't get in and I still had there stuff, I thought to myself no that's mean I will go back and pick them up. Not too far away I turn around and went on my way after them.  As I was doing that they were crossing the crosswalk not letting me go on my way they were smiling. @CAPS7 then I knew they wanted to have fun. I told them to come inside, they tried but the door was locked. My friend @CAPS2 jumped in the back of the pickup.I was going about @NUM1 miles per hour.My friend @CAPS2 crawled through the middle window that could be opened from the back of the pickup.As he got through he unlocked the door to let @PERSON1 in and @CAPS2 almost fell out of the pickup face first, but I caught @NUM2 fell and got back up laughing.I looked back and he was going to go get his shoes that fell off of his feet @CAPS2 was trying to shut the door that was flung open. I was worried about @PERSON1, @CAPS7 I stopped let @CAPS2 get on his feet again and told him to watch the pick up @CAPS7 nobody steals the car. @PERSON1 was back holding his leg shaking back and forth. I went to go get him as I was walking towards him, @PERSON1 took off running and then ran around the corner. I couldn't tell if he was being serious or not. I assumed that he was, I went after him. I couldn't see him @CAPS7 I went back towards the truck where I was when I started looking for @ORGANIZATION1.I looked back at @CAPS2 and the pickup, but nothing was their where I was a minute ago, he had left me to walk like I made them walk. I tried looking for @PERSON1 around the block, but i couldn't find him I thought he would be with @CAPS2 and he was just a couple bocks away where he took my truck. It looks like they're in a parking lot not too far away, I saw my truck nobody in the town of @LOCATION1 has the same truck as me. It was kind of dark by then @CAPS7 I had an idea to go up by them and scare them. I started walking towards the truck. I couldn't wait to see the expressions on their faces! I was really determined to make the scare happen. I finally got to the parking lot. I saw my truck I knew that was them wiout a doubt.I finally got their and I screamed really loud. I had made a huge mistake. That was not my friends, nor anyone I knew. That truck was somebody elses. The person I saw was a bigger build cowboy guy scared and angry. I said ""@CAPS11 sorry"", explained to him who I thought he was and what I was trying to do, he wasnt as mad after that, yet I still walked away embarrassed, I walked to @CAPS2 and @PERSON1's house.

8,"Laughter is a big part of life. A lot of people look at you how much you laugh in life cause it place a part in your life every day. Some people say they never laugh, I think that is crazy cause if you never laugh how will you enjoy life. There are so many people that say that I laugh to much I always say you can never laugh to much it to good for you. there are so many story's that I could tell you but I think I have the best one on my mind. It is the time I went to the park with my friends on a @DATE2 @TIME1.It all started on a @DATE2 @TIME1 I was at the park with my friends and I. we were all just playing catch with the football and out of no were one of my friends want out for a pass and ran right into a swing and fall straight on his face it was the funnest thing I have ever seen. I was on the ground for like @NUM1 min laughing. we tolled everyone at the school cause one of my friends filmed it so we watch it over and over and over again. That why I think laughing plays such a big part in your life cause it helps people get to know the real you and it makes laugh so much more fun. That's why laughing is so much fun I mean that's why I cant see why people don't like to laugh cause it is the biggest part in my life and I always use it. I use laughing like a second voice. I wouldn't enjoy live if @CAPS1't laugh cause it would be like being a robot and that sounds dumb but back to a neither story I am going to talk about when i was snowboarding with @PERSON1.It was on the @DATE1 up at @CAPS2.Hood @PERSON1 and I were going snowboarding. we were just doing some runs and some simple tricks and we stop for lunch. after lunch we went back and the first run @PERSON1 said lets go to the top so I said @CAPS3. So we were on the lift to the top and when we got to the top it was a lot higher then we thought but we still went down. About half way down I trued to hit a jump and I did a @NUM2 and landed straight on my face so I look up and @PERSON1 laughing at me and I looked up again and trying was laughing so hard at me he didn't see the tree in front of me and run right into it. I was laughing so hard he was saying it was my fault cause I crushed so he did but ones we were at the bottom we went back in side and we were laughing at either for what just happen and how we were the best in are grade and we just sucked. So there something when you laugh at someone cause they do something make sure your not hurting there feeling cause it will beat you in the but and something will happen to you. that's why when some people do something funny I make sure they are laughing too. So when you are laughing at someone make sure they are laughing too. How would you feel if someone was laughing at you when you fall down the stairs would you feel good about your self that's what you have to think before you laugh at someone for doing whatever they did.In my summary I tolled you some of the best times I laugh and some of the worst but the biggest reason i write my paper about this is it plays a big part of life how people look at you. You don't want people to think you are some @CAPS4 so laugh one in a while cause you only get one life so have fun. the element of laughing is heaving fun and to enjoy life. I do think it plays a big part of relationships with family friends and employed. life is to short to not have fun and you. You do want to look back on your childhood and say that you had fun and you laugh. I tell you right now I laugh the most out of my friends and I feel I could still laugh more. that was my story I hope you get a lot out of it and some laugh.",33.0,6.0

When we arrived at the meeting place, the orientation with the coordinator was still in session. As we waited outside, thoughts were running through my head. What does she look like? Will she like our family? The time had come to meet our exchange student for the first time, and all of my thoughts had settled.

Not too long afterward, @PERSON1 and I were talking about anything that came to mind. It made me feel like I had a sister for the first time. Sadly, there was a minor language barrier between the two of us but her laughter completed all her thoughts. Her laughter made me feel like she liked me as a host sister and made her stay more fun for her and I. During @PERSON1's stay, I devoted more time to her than to my school work. We played board games and card games each night but they were all at home. I felt like it made her experience boring and incomplete. On @DATE1, the day before her departure, I took her souvenir shopping. It was a jaunt to the mall to shop for her family and experience another part of town. @PERSON1 and I were excited to spend a nice day together and end her trip in an unforgettable way. Our first stop at the mall was @CAPS3-a-@CAPS4 @CAPS5. I had told @PERSON1 about it and she was very excited to @CAPS3 bears for her family. She had never seen anything like it. We started off by picking out a @CAPS4, then we stuffed it, picked out clothes for it, and we gave it a name and made a birth certificate for it. We continued roaming the mall when we finished, but could not find anything too unique or not available in @LOCATION2. Our last stop was @CAPS6 to shop for @CAPS7 snacks. During her stay, I had introduced her to a lot of @CAPS7 foods like granola bars and fruit snack, she liked them and wanted to take them home for brother and little cousins. When we were done, we got on the subway and headed home. My mom was not at the subway station when we got there, so we continued shopping. We walked into an accessories store that was loaded with earrings and necklaces and many other girly items. @PERSON1 and I spotted a section that had friendship necklaces. There was a necklace that said best friends with two roller skates. Roller skating was perhaps the most fun thing she got to experience in @LOCATION1 and it was a great bonding experience for the two of us. Without hesitation, we bought the necklaces and wore it to symbolize our lasting friendship.  That night, after shopping for the whole day, our family took @PERSON1 out for her last dinner in @LOCATION1. Every night, my parents had prepared @CAPS9 food which was relatively close to @CAPS1 food, so when we went out for @CAPS11 food that night, it was the first time @PERSON1 had tried something rather foreign. @PERSON1 told us that the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION1 tasted different but better than the @CAPS11 food in @LOCATION2. She told us that she really enjoyed the stay and was very grateful for meeting our family. These words made me even more dreadful of @DATE2, the day that she would be fly back to @LOCATION2 and be with her real family. The day we had to say our goodbyes. I had not expected the week to pass by so fast. @DATE2 was here and @PERSON1's stay in @LOCATION1 had came to an end. Cameras were rapidly flashing and my mouth was was hurting from the constant smiling we were doing to capture our last memories. I stayed at the airport for as long as I possibly could and every last moment I spent with her seemed more and more emotional. I had met @PERSON1 just a week ago but I created such a close bond with her that I did not want her to leave. She was like my best friend that knew everything about me and brought me so much joy. I could not help but let out the tears I was trying so hard to hold back. When she entered into security I remember the feeling I had. I didn't know when I was going to see her again, or what our future was going to hold. I had a great time with her and I hope that she felt the same way. Her laughter overrides any communication problems that we had. @PERSON1, your optimistic and friendly personality will always be remembered.  ",40.0,7.0
8," In the @DATE2 me and my family thought of going to @LOCATION2 for the @DATE1 of @DATE1. My mom planned on going to visit my aunt @CAPS1 and to go to the coast.We started packing @DATE1 so we could spend time with the family.At five o'clock in the morning we woke up on a @DATE3 so we could start heading to @LOCATION2.We brought food in a cooler so we could eat during the trip, the people who went on the trip with us were my little sister @PERSON4, my sister @CAPS2, my brother @PERSON1, my step brother @PERSON2 and my step dad. By the time we got on the freeway we were off to @LOCATION2 I fell asleep for a while by the time I woke up we were already at a casino called the wild horse casino. It was a pretty big casino, when we got inside there were big totem poles and wood carved animals all over the place. We made our way to the restaurant for breakfast. The food their was good , after we were done eating my mom and step-dad went to gamble so they gave us money to go play in the arcade. While my brothers and sisters were playing games I left for a while to look around and see what there was to do , so I went roaming around just looking to see what I could do to entertain myself. Then all of a sudden I hear a noise that that I thought was a video game that I knew so I look inside the and I see these people on computers playing call of duty.A few minutes later I heard my mom calling me so i start heading to the arcade and there they were waiting for me to get there so we can start heading to @LOCATION2. By the time we get on the van I felt exasted so so i took a nap for a while , I fell asleep for a while so the time could go by.My parents would take turns driving so they each get their rest , we would go to a restaurant or a gas station every few hours. After my nap my mo told me that we were a few minutes away from my aunts house so I put my music on and listened to it so something could entertain me while I wait to get off. By the time my brother and sisters woke up we were already there at my aunts just exited to get off lay down and rest from a long day of traveling. We slept for a while then we got up to go too the mall so we could buy some stuff for the family and some clothes for school. So we went to a lot of stores we went to @LOCATION3 , @CAPS3 locker, @CAPS4 penny , @PERSON3 , @LOCATION1 s coat factory and a couple more stores. By the end of the day we were done shopping we left to golden coral for dinner we ate there for about an hour the food there was great I had to go there more often. We left the restaurant and went back to my aunts , when we got to my aunts me and my brother watched t.v. so we had something to do instead of just being bored. While I was watching t.v. I fell asleep and did not wake up until the next day , in the morning my mom woke me up for some breakfast. I got up and ate my moms delicious food then took a shower , it was the @DATE1 and we left to buy fireworks for u later at night. We went all over the place and finally we found what we wanted , after we bought our fireworks we got ready to go to the beach for a @DATE1 of @DATE1 party kind of thing where people go to have fun and watch the fireworks that were gonna be blown to the sky. We waited for a few hours for the big show too start , then finally the lights to the board walk turned off and the show was about to start. On the other side of the beach there were people who were lighting the fire works and after they moved out of the way the fireworks started popping all over the place it made the whole beach light up , so a few hours later the fireworks stopped and we were already leaving bye the time it was over. the traffic was bad and it took a long time to get threw bu by the time we were already threw i was asleep and i did not wake up untill we got to my aunts house. My mom woke me up so I could go to sleep in my aunts guest room so I did and went to sleep till the morning. We left home the next morning wishing we came back next year.",34.0,6.0
8,"   My @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.    It was the first day of my freshman year and I was more nervous than I had ever been in my whole life. I was scared that school would be hard and that I would be all by myself and that I wouldn't have any @CAPS4 but I would later learn I was very wrong. I never would imagine @PERSON3, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 would become @CAPS1 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 that I couldn't live without. You'll understand better if i tell you the story of how we became @CAPS3 @CAPS4. We all had are first @CAPS1 classes together and I guess that's where we bonded.   @PERSON3 and I had gone to school together the previous year but we weren't much of friend seeing as we hated each other with a passion. Later I found out that we really had nothing to hate each other for so it wasn't that hard to win her over. My first impression of @PERSON1 that was she would be preppy and I pushed her away but then she grew on me. She wasn't that super fecal person I thought she would be and when I got to know her she had her ups and downs but she was really cool. Last but not least @PERSON2, at first she was really annoying. I mean really annoying she never stopped talking but after a few weeks she was really fun to talk to.  All @CAPS1 of these relationships grew stronger and stronger through laughter and just plain out there fun! We started hanging out and going to school dances together. A week before the homecoming dance I got sick and I wasn't able to go but my @CAPS4 were still worried about me and that felt good to have someone worry about me and I was glad these girls became my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Then on my @NUM1 birthday I had a big party and not many people came but they did and that night every single one of them called me at mid-night saying happy birthday at that moment I new that we would be @CAPS4 forever and nothing would come between us. That we would be able to go through the hardest times and over come them. Then when the fun times come we would be wild and laugh tell we couldn't anymore. I am glad to call these girls my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Sometimes they get on my nerves and make me mad but I know that they will be here for me know matter what happens. Through all those good times and bad times I will have @CAPS1 great people in my life forever and I'm glad that they happened. Laughter really is the shortest distance between @CAPS4 and I wouldn't give it up for anything in the whole wide world because the happiest memories are with my @CAPS4 laughing are hearts out.

8," Being happy is an important part of any relationship. It is something that is found individually and brought to the relationship to be shared. After discovering happiness alone, a relationship can start to develop and the happiness can be shared. This most often happens in the form of laughter.  Laughter truly has an influence on a relationship but it expands to even deeper key elements that lead to success of a relationship. Like I stated before joy, or happiness, is important in any and all relationships. However, I don't mean just being happy when you are with that person and not being able to find it within life on your own; it actually means being able to enjoy life individually without depending on another human to satisfy you. If happiness isn't found individually how can you expect someone else to make you happy? Utter joy is found on your own in the little things life has to offer like a smile, a laugh, or a beautiful day.  When the initiative has been taken to be happy with yourself then it can be shared with others. This is were laughter and happiness join hand-in-hand! Joy is displayed through two main expressions first through a smile, secondly through laughing. Hearing a significant other laugh or seeing them smile gives the feeling of happiness. Laughter has the ability to lighten the mood as well as calm a tense situation. Although a relationship without laughter can lead to tense, sad, or even uncomfortable situations leaving both involved unhappy.  From my own personal experience with relationships I have come to learn that laughter is a key element to the development of a strong bond between two people. I learned this lesson in the midst of personal struggles to build bonds with two very important people. With the first one I had spent three years struggling to cooperate with, though the other I spent six months trying to find a flaw in. Where the first relationship failed was the fact that neither of us had the ability to cheer the other. Together we thought that being alone was sad or lonely, and if we were together we could make each other happy. The truth is we were totally wrong in both aspects, first in thinking happiness was found in each other as well as not having the ability to express our happiness with one another. Throughout the second relationship, @PERSON2 and I, met on the idea life was exciting, both care free and satisfied with where we were. It wasn't hard to laugh, in fact both of us were very humorous bright people! Our bond was created through our sense of humor and our love for laughter. As time passed our joy brought us closer and closer, it has also helped us overcome obstacles we have stumbled through along the way.  Due to the ability to share laughter and joy, @PERSON2 and I have a connection that has built itself, of course it has ups and downs but since those downs can easily be resolved, the relationship is lasting. Along with building bonds and keeping them together laughter can make you feel closer to those you love. I believe this is the very best part of laughter. When distant from those important life can get lonely. Although being able to call someone you left and share a little piece of joy with them can make a bad day turn completely upside down. Then that feeling inside that was once sad and lonely now feels warm and less empty. I have moved several times throughout high school, and the hardest move I ever made was recently when moved to @PERSON1. I left a lot of my friends, mentors, family and @PERSON2. Coming to a new place I felt alone, I was not surrounded by familiar people, and I extremely missed the time I lost with @PERSON2. What helped me most during the transition was being able to call him and though we missed each other sharing a happy conversation seemed to make things better. When we would talk often times we were able to share laughter through old memories or new ones. The laughter my @PERSON2 and I were able to share had the ability to make us feel no so far apart! More importantly because of laughter we were able to stay close, and I had someone there for me during the new changes I encountered. Laughter is a extraordinary part of life, without out laughter many things would be lost like fun, joy, humor and happiness; if not lost they wouldn't be as they are now. For me, laughter has been an extremely important part of my life, there are many struggles with relationships and life I couldn't have overcame without that piece of joy it was able to provide. To me without laughter there would be no point to live because there would be now joy in life. Laughter is a powerful tool, it really does make the world a better place.  ",38.0,6.0
8,"                                    Warm Laughter   I think everyone have to laughter, and everyone hear laughter. What is laughter? The question looks easy. But, the question has many answers. Everyone has the answer for myself. Someone said: laughter is the shortest distance between two people. Someone thought laughter is the best form of communication between humans. Moreover, I thought the laughter like the sun, and it can melt ice of human's heart.   I want to tell a true story about my class. when I was @NUM1 years old. I studied in middle school my class had @NUM2 people.(In @LOCATION1, every class had many people. we didn't move the class.) I remembered in my class had one student. His name was @CAPS1. @CAPS2 studied very hard. @CAPS2 always take a good grade in testes. Every teacher thought @CAPS2 was a good student. But, many students didn't like him below me. Because @CAPS2 often snitch. Whenever @CAPS2 saw student copy each other. @CAPS2 talked to teacher immediately. We hated him. But, we thought @CAPS2 is a brave boy after @CAPS2 do one even.   Remembered this even happen when we left class. My friends and I played the table tennis in school. We played very happily. But in this time, I used big strength hitting the ball. The ball through the table hit one man. I saw @CAPS2 was very tall and strong. I thought @CAPS2 was a high school student. @CAPS2 was very angry. @CAPS2 told loudly:"" shut, whose ball hit me."" @CAPS2 saw us. @CAPS2 walked slowly to us. So, we was very afraid.   @CAPS2 asked us:"" @CAPS3 hit me."" We didn't talk anything. ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS2 asked again. I said ""me"". @CAPS2 look me. @CAPS2 lifted his arm. I closed my eyes. ""stop"" one boy said. I open the eyes. I saw @CAPS1. @CAPS2 was in front of me. Th man punch him in the face. ""@CAPS5 you punch me"" @CAPS1 asked. The man said:"" I don't want to punch you and I want to punch the student behind your. "" @CAPS5 you punch him and @CAPS2 is my friend. @CAPS1 said. The man said:"" @CAPS2 used his ball hit me. I said:"" sorry, I am not carefully. "" @CAPS2 already said sorry. Can you return his ball? if you don't return his ball, I talked to you teacher. I know you are form @NUM3 grade. The man said:"" @CAPS9, no problem. At then, the man used the big strength threw the ball hit @CAPS1's heat. @CAPS1 get hurt. But, @CAPS1 didn't talk anything. @CAPS2 just look the man all the time. The man said:"" you are good. the man go away. ""@CAPS12, it's hurt.@CAPS1 said. I said:"" are you @CAPS9, I am sorry. @CAPS1 laughed to me said:"" I am good. Don't worry. You played ball carefully. I said:""yes, thank you. @CAPS1 said:"" see you, I will go home. You go home early. You mother worry you. I said:"" see you. @CAPS1 go home. I thought his laughter is very warm. The laughter like the sun through mu heart. @CAPS2 is a really good man. So, after the even happened @CAPS2 was be my friend best.   laughter is the most nice sounds in the world. I always don't forget the warm laughter. It tell me I should brave, I don't give up and I have to happy. I miss you. I don't know you are good or bad now.

8,"Laughter is a great part of life. Making someone laugh really makes you feel wonderful. There are many times that i have had a terrific laugh. The one that i remember the most was when i was with this guy, and we were in p.e.. We had amazing times together, but the day that he almost threw me over his head was the best one.The days at school when i have p.e. are the days i definitely don't want to go. I was walking and talking with my friends about how i really didn't want to go to class. All my friends told me just to go to class and it wouldn't be that bad. I decided to listen to them and i ended up going.I was in the gymnasium waiting for my p.e. teacher @PERSON1 @PERSON1 to finish taking roll, so that I could go talk to my two best friends @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as i could i ran over to @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON2, but they were talking about this guy named @PERSON3. We all were sitting down just talking, until @PERSON1 told us to come sit in the middle of the gym. He told us that we could choose what game we wanted to play.We all decided to choose kick ball, because it was fun and simple. Everyone started to get up so that we could start playing the game. I decided to just stay sprawled out on the gym floor. @ORGANIZATION1 told me to get up before someone stepped on me, but at that point I didn't really care if someone did or didn't step on me. @PERSON3 came over and told me that he was my body guard, and that he was there to protect me. He grabbed my hands and pulled me up as hard as he could. I nearly flew over his head but he caught me just in time and we fell to the ground. We stayed down laughing, @PERSON1 ended up yelling at us. We just got up and played the game.In the end me listening to my friends was a good idea. I had a great laugh and ended up getting to know someone new. Laughter is something that heals me when I'm not in the greatest mood.

8," If you're @CAPS11 me you're the type of person that laughs at the dumbest jokes or the simplest things in life, I believe laughter is an important part of any relationship.Don't you hate that feeling when you laugh and you think you're going to pee yourself because your laughing too hard or you find something extremely funny? Well I do, I've peed myself once because I was laughing too hard and I couldn't manage to hold @CAPS14 in. @CAPS14 was my brother's @NUM1 @CAPS5 party, I still remember this @CAPS11 if @CAPS14 were yesterday.               @CAPS14 was about a week before my brother's @CAPS5 so my parents and I decided that we would surprise him with a @CAPS5 party. His @CAPS5 wasn't going to be anything big just me my parents and my younger siblings.My mom had planned that she would go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 after work to buy him chocolate ice cream cake something he would definitely enjoy, balloons and a @CAPS3 set. Those were his favorite kind of toys which he had millions of! I agreed with her and told her that I would make dinner since she would be home later than usual. I decided that I would cook @PERSON1's all time favorite dinner @CAPS4. @CAPS14 was an easy meal to make so I thought we should spoil him since @CAPS14 was his @CAPS5. But he had no idea he would get more than he expected.        A week had past @CAPS14 was @DATE1. I ran into my brothers room and woke him up ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5 @PERSON1!"" I yelled early in the morning @CAPS14 was about six fifteen a.m. He looked annoyed and still half asleep all he said was ""@CAPS7 @CAPS10,"" and told me to get out and went back to sleep. I was a little disappointed thinking maybe he would be more enthusiastic since @CAPS14 was his @CAPS5, I think I was more excited than he was. We had school that day so I got ready and went off to school. After a long exhausting day of school, I went home to an empty house, no one was home yet and my parents were working. My siblings were all in elementary school so they got out a little later than I did. I sat in the living room looking out the window and waited for my sister and my brothers to come home. Once they were all off the bus I opened the door @PERSON2,@CAPS8 and @CAPS9 barged in through the house yelling ""@CAPS10 wer're homeeee!"" @CAPS11 I hadn't noticed. Once @PERSON1 was inside I gave him a hug and again told him @CAPS6 @CAPS5. I was curious so I asked him ""@CAPS13 was your day?"" in my motherly voice. ""@CAPS14 was good, my teachers and friends sang @CAPS6 @CAPS5 to me during lunch, I also got a chocolate cupcake,"" he said in a joyful voice. After that he went off to his room, and I went off into the kitchen to cook dinner for all of us. I was excited I wanted that chocolate ice cream cake and I couldn't wait.       After dinner I had to wash the dishes and clean up the mess. Once I was done with the dishes I got the cake out of the refrigerator and set @CAPS14 on the table. Everyone was to occupied to even notice what we were doing. Once the candles were placed around the cake, my mother told the kids to come to the dining room. @PERSON1 obviously hadn't heard because he was the last one to come. When he was coming from the hallway we all yelled ""surprise!"" his face looked shocked and you could tell he was @CAPS6. All the kids had sat down except for me my mom, my dad and @PERSON1 we were the only ones standing surrounding the cake. I was to the left of my brother my dad was behind him and my mom was to his right. My brother was about to sit down but right when he was going to sit my dad moved the chair to the side and he fell flat on his butt. He didn't do @CAPS14 on purpose he was just trying to move @CAPS14 so my brother could blow the candles.@CAPS14 was hilarious we all started laughing, I laughed so hard i peed myself I was on the floor rolling. After that my brother started laughing at me his face was red @CAPS11 a tomato. I was so embarrassed I couldn't believe what had happened.    My parents were also laughing @CAPS14 was just a family moment we didn't get to see as often. I mean @CAPS14 was nice to know that, that experience brought all of us a memorable experience and a lot of laughter. Now every year when its my brothers @CAPS5 he makes fun of me @CAPS11 its a joke to him.That will be unforgettable. I do believe laughter brings out the best in any relationship.We laugh every day of our lives,even if @CAPS14 means peeing yourself. Laughter brings happiness and memorable moments into our lives.

8,"  I never really thought about how laughter can change the whole outcome of a situation. Where would the world be without a little bit of laughter now and then? Does anyone really think about it though? I know I didn't. Laughter was just a part of life. I would laugh when someone said or did something funny, but I never thought of laughter's impact on my life or the life of someone else.  I did not have to think about laughter until the day it impacted me in an unexpected way. It started out as a normal day. The ten minute walk to school in the icy morning air, one class after another, and so on. However, this day didn't have an plans of being normal. By lunch I thought my life, as I knew it, was over. Panic filled my heart as I beat my fist against my locker. It just couldn't be jammed! I'd be late for @CAPS1, and there was going to be a test today. With a sigh of frustration I decided to try the combination just one more time. With a yank my locker door flew open, scattering my papers everywhere. Quickly, I gathered up my papers, got my @CAPS1 book, and ran to class. I tripped on the stairs, but I make it to class ten seconds before the tardy bell rang.   After @CAPS1 class, I went to get my lunch. By then I was feeling a little bit better about myself. I even felt that I might have done well on the @CAPS1 test. A hint of a smile crossed my face as I picked up my tray of food and began to walk back toward @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a skip in my step. That's when it happened, the one event that made everything else that happened that day seem small in comparison. I tripped! The food from my tray went flying all direction as I fell flat on my face.  At that moment I realized that I could have reacted in one of two ways. I could have wallowed in self pity. After everything that had happened that day, my first instinct was to cry. I could have ran from the shocked and seemingly mocking faces of my peers. But where would that have left me? It would not have had any good effect on my mood, and it certainly would not have fixed any of my problems. Instead I got up and smiled. My face was red with embarrassment, but then I did something that really change the outcome of my day. A small, timid laugh escaped my lips. Soon the crowd broke into laughter as well. I laughed with all of the people around me. Sure they were probably laughing at me, not with me, but I really did not care at that moment. I had learned something that day. Now that I think back on it, things could have been a whole lot worse. Even though I @MONTH1 not have had a lunch that day, at least I have a good story to tell. Laughter can sometimes seem bad or meaningless, and I still sometimes think of it that way. But now when I think about laughter, I think back on that day, and it still brings a smile to my face.

8," Laughing with my @CAPS1    @CAPS2 was a hot @DATE1 day in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. My @CAPS1 and I just got done eating a scrumptious flieschkegla lunch. I asked her if she wanted to go down and play a game of baseball on the @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. My @CAPS1 said that she would love to. As we got down in to the chilled basement, we felt a cool breeze that soothed our skin because of how blistering hot @CAPS2 was on that day. We sat down on the rough carpet and started to play.  We chose our teams, she was the @LOCATION1 and I was the @ORGANIZATION1 because those were our favorite teams. We started the game, and my @CAPS1 didn't know how to play, so I had to teach her everything. Every time she would do something wrong we would start laughing because we thought @CAPS2 was very funny that she couldn't do anything right. She would try to throw to first base, but she would push the button that made the player throw to third, so I would keep running around the bases until I scored. This made us laugh very, very hard because she couldn't get me out, except when I helped her. Eventually, my mom came in to record all of this because my @CAPS1 and I couldn't stop laughing, and if we did stop laughing @CAPS2 wasn't for very long before we started up again.  Then after we played about five innings of the nine inning game the most amusing part of this whole game happened. I hit the ball into the outfield and @CAPS2 hit the wall. As my @CAPS1 went to go throw @CAPS2 in, I was already around the bases. Once she got the ball in, she got @CAPS2 to the pitcher and he ran to the dugout, and she couldn't get out of there. @CAPS2 took her about five to ten minutes to get out, and through that whole time we were laughing! We made jokes about how the manager was telling his pitcher to do better than he was because he was pitching so bad, and how he was too scared to get back on the mound because of his dreadful pitching. The laughter of just us two carried through the house. Even after the funniest part of the game, the laughter continued through the remainder of the baseball game.     After we were done playing, I told her I thought that she had played like a @CAPS1. She thought that that was hilarious and with the sound of her laughter, I couldn't help myself but to brake out laughing. My @CAPS1 had this unique laugh through the whole game that always sparked something in my funny bone that made me laugh.  Throughout the rest of the time that I was at my @CAPS1's house, when someone would bring up baseball or playing @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1, my @CAPS1 and I would laugh and laugh until @CAPS2 hurt. I would also joke about wanting to play her again and she would then let out a rotund laugh that would make me fall into a laughing trance.  After this day, I have always felt different about how I thought of my @CAPS1. I always thought that she was a very generous and nice person with a great attitude, but I never thought that she was as smiley and giggly as she was on that day. I now know that I can make jokes with her and that she can make jokes with me because we can both laugh at our mistakes. The biggest thing that I can take from this event is that I will always remember my @CAPS1 for her laughter, and even after she passes away from our world, I can know that she is laughing at me and with me, up in heaven.

The example above about someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 that person is correct.  It was a hot @DATE1 day. I was over at my friends house playing video games with him. ""@CAPS2 man it's hot out,"" I said, ""wanna go down to the river?"" my @CAPS26 @PERSON3 just glanced at me and turned his head back to his computer. ""@CAPS3,"" @PERSON3 said, ""why not."" @CAPS4 then we left his place and went to my place.  I grabbed my swim trunks, a few drinks, my pack of cigarettes, and my towel. @PERSON3 saw the cigarettes and groaned. ""I'm sorry @PERSON3,"" I said, ""I won't smoke around you."" @CAPS5 gave me a little smile like @CAPS5 was saying @CAPS7 not around me. We went back to his place @CAPS4 @CAPS5 can get his things. Few minutes after we got on our bikes and headed out to the river. It took us @NUM1 minutes to get to the river. Once we got there we sat down on the edge of the river on the bank. ""say I wonder if there are any crawdads around."" said @PERSON3. I pondered the comment for a minute. ""I don't know,"" I said, "" probably not yet."" For the next five minutes nothing but silence, until I flicked my lighter to light my smoke. ""@CAPS1 I'm going in,"" @PERSON3 said, ""come in when your done smoking..."" ""@CAPS7,"" I said, "" why don't I just come in also, we can go to @ORGANIZATION1 and float down back to here."" @PERSON3 laughs, ""@CAPS8 @CAPS10 sounds good.""  We then walked across the river to get to this area that is crowded with over growth of bushes at least fifteen feet high. Whats funny when we @CAPS17 this while sneaking to @ORGANIZATION1 is that we were in military fatigues. They got wet but, @CAPS11 @CAPS1, we do this a lot @CAPS4 we didn't care. We got to @ORGANIZATION1 quickly running and laughing. Because we thought we were at @LOCATION1, running from dogs. @CAPS11 @CAPS4 much fun. I took off my fatigues and set them out to dry and changed into my swim trunks, lit up another cigarette. ""@CAPS2, that was close lieutenant."" I said. ""@CAPS10,"" @PERSON3 chuckled, ""we forgot the drinks the float back down."" ""@CAPS11 crud!"" I said,""@CAPS12 on our six!"" we jumped into the water. Me doing a cannon ball, and @PERSON3 doing some weird @CAPS13 dive from the cliff. ""@CAPS14 off."" We both said at the same @CAPS15. the sun was setting we arrived back at our beach side by the river. ""@CAPS15 to go back i suppose."" I said. ""I agree."" @PERSON3 said. @CAPS4 we sat for a few minutes and drank a few energy drinks and got dressed. ""We need to get the fatigues."" I said. ""I'll go,"" @PERSON3 said, ""and you go to the bikes and wait I'll be there in five."" @CAPS4 we split up, I went to the bikes and @CAPS5 went to the fatigues.  We had a good @CAPS15 riding back to his house, laughing all the way back. ""@CAPS17 you see the looks on thoughs @CAPS18 faces when we came out of the bushes?"" I asked. @PERSON3 laughed, ""@CAPS10, that was hella funny they were like, '@CAPS11 @CAPS21!'.""

8," A little bit of laughter, I think is the key @CAPS10 life. @CAPS13 no one laughed wouldn't life be boring. @CAPS7 a story about laughter. I can say i @CAPS15 about everything I have @CAPS7 many memories, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 all time favorite memory about laughter would be, The day i stayed the night at @CAPS2 best friends house and @CAPS2 best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS3 and I were all sitting on a bed and well lets just say was a bit crazy. @CAPS7 @CAPS2 best friend out of no where was just like ""@CAPS4 i have @CAPS10 sneeze"" and @CAPS5 was early in the morning @CAPS7 we were all tired, and careless. I said ""@CAPS6 okay, i don't care"" @CAPS7 she goes ""ah ah ah chuu"" and was looking straight at @CAPS16, @CAPS8't even bother @CAPS10 turn her head and @CAPS7 she sneezed all over @CAPS16, and she was sick. @CAPS7 instead of getting mad, we had nothing else @CAPS10 do @CAPS1 just @CAPS15, and we kept going and going and going @CAPS9 like we couldn't stop, and every time one of us would start @CAPS10 talk we'd just start @CAPS12 again or when the more we would think about @CAPS18 we would again start @CAPS12 and @CAPS12 @CAPS18 was like @CAPS18 was endless. @CAPS9 crazy how much you can @CAPS15 about just one little thing that isn't really that interesting.  One thing about laughter is no matter what the situation is when you think about @CAPS18, you @CAPS15 harder. And when you tell @CAPS18 @NUM1 minutes later @CAPS9 even more hilarious. @CAPS1 when you try @CAPS10 tell someone else about what happened, and they weren't there @CAPS9 really not that funny @CAPS10 them, @CAPS1 @CAPS7 funny @CAPS10 you. @CAPS9 only funny @CAPS10 the people who were there. I like @CAPS10 think of laughter is life, @CAPS13 you don't @CAPS15 were would life take you, i know some old people who @CAPS15 @CAPS10 @CAPS5 day. @CAPS7 don't just sit around being grouchy @CAPS15 a little bit @CAPS18 really brightens up your day. @CAPS10 @CAPS5 day i still think about all the memories i have, that i still @CAPS15 about that happened years ago. Laughter connects you @CAPS10 people, one @CAPS15 and you have a friend, @CAPS9 even a step closer @CAPS10 marriage. I remember @CAPS5 one time, i wasn't even paying attention, i was sitting in the back seat and a bug hit the window, and @CAPS2 friends sister, screamed @CAPS7 loud, and I got scared i screamed right after her, @CAPS10 @CAPS5 day i still can't figure out why, I thought we were going @CAPS10 die or something, @CAPS18 was pretty crazy, @CAPS1 we still @CAPS15 about @CAPS18, @CAPS12 is the element @CAPS10 pretty much every story i have.  @CAPS7 one last thing i must say, @CAPS13 i never laughed in @CAPS2 life i probably wouldn't have any friend, cause all @CAPS2 friends and I do is @CAPS15, and @CAPS15. That's all we care about, Is @CAPS12 and having a good time in life cause remember you only have one life @CAPS10 live. @CAPS7 live love and @CAPS15 why you have the chance. Also don't let anyone bring you down @CAPS18's your life @CAPS9 only a matter of laughter that can bring you up, @CAPS9 the key @CAPS10 life, @CAPS15 your heart out. When I'm sad, or unhappy, the one memory that i think about, is that day @CAPS2 aunt almost ran over @CAPS2 mom, @CAPS16 & @CAPS2 friend were @CAPS12 for @CAPS7 long @CAPS2 stomach hurt, @CAPS18 was hilarious because @CAPS2 moms facial expressions, and @CAPS2 aunt the way she was @CAPS12 @CAPS18 was great. @CAPS7 @CAPS15 a little. All @CAPS2 stories have a little bit of laughter.",44.0,7.0
8," I tapped @CAPS4 foot nervously as the comedian stepped down from the stage. The audience's applause was strong but brief--more polite than appreciative. I use the term ""audience"" loosely, as at least four fifths of the people who were sitting before the stage were also comedians. Only five people were brave enough to show up without any intent of participating themselves. At that moment, all I could think about was how much I wished I was one of them, but I wasn't. I had to perform. The comedian was replaced by the announcer, and @CAPS4 foot's tapping became a relentless pounding. Looking back, I didn't really have a reason to be as distressed as I was. The audience was sparse at best, and they couldn't have had high expectations. If they had, why would they have come to an open-mic on the seventh floor of a public service building? I knew all this at the time, but knowing didn't diminish @CAPS4 anxiety. Stage fright is an irrational, primal fear, and such fears rarely yield to logic. Thus @CAPS4 panic swelled, even as the announcer called me to the stage. Then it happened. Shortly after ascending the stage, I became aware of the announcer's silence. The audience was focused on me; I was expected to speak. In that instant I forgot everything I had memorized. The routine I had so diligently practiced over the past few days completely fled @CAPS4 mind. It hadn't been a very good routine, but it had been something to hold onto. Now it was gone. The audience wanted something from me that I no longer had.  @CAPS4 brain scrambled for leverage, for anything that could be used to extricate myself from the situation I had found myself in. The microphone! It was still on the stand. I slowly took the microphone into @CAPS4 hands and deliberately set the stand aside. However that only bought me a few seconds; I needed to do better than that. Searching deeper, @CAPS4 brain turned to @CAPS4 comedy education. @CAPS4 education, like @CAPS4 routine, had been brief and unspectacular. However a few key things stuck out, among them one of the very first things I had learned. ""All comedy stems from negative opinion,"" @CAPS4 teacher had constantly repeated during our private lessons. ""All @CAPS1 gotta do in stand-up is complain."" That was it. I had found @CAPS4 way out. Immediately, I put on an indignant voice and began to speak. ""@CAPS1 know what I hate most?"" I demanded, even as I struggled to find the answer myself. However @CAPS4 brain was gaining momentum, it was no longer frozen as it had been a few moments ago. I realized that the announcer had miss-pronounced @CAPS4 last name. Choosing this fact as the thing I detested most in the world, I sneered, ""@CAPS2 people say @CAPS3-man!"" I don't know why, maybe it was because @CAPS4 relatively young voice sounded funny, or perhaps it was because I had packed those four words with such condescension. For whatever reason, the audience laughed. ""@CAPS4 last name is @CAPS5,"" I cried with outrage, emboldened by this new-found encouragement. I proceeded to rebuke the announcer for his grave error and even went so far as to denounce all of the people in the world who couldn't be bothered to pronounce people's names correctly. Once again, @CAPS4 ludicrous rant was met with laughter. Upon hearing this laughter, I realized I had already succeeded. If the audience would laugh at @CAPS4 crudely improvised remarks, surely they would do the same for @CAPS4 meticulously crafted jokes. With this reassurance in mind, @CAPS4 preparations came back to me as if I had never forgotten them. @CAPS4 confidence renewed, I told everything from the beginning. I launched into a criticism of @LOCATION1's polluted sky and crowed streets. Yet the audience wasn't interested in the content of @CAPS4 presentation. They were interested in the loud, indignant kid before them who stubbornly refused to let anything satisfy him.  I continued to play the part I had created for myself with increasing enthusiasm. Yet before I had even gotten through half @CAPS4 material, the red light turned on. I had one minute left to finish. Rather than struggling to fill @CAPS4 five minutes of time as I had anticipated, I instead found myself with much more to say. I had created an engrossing dialogue with the audience that was every bit as hard to break away from as an actual conversation. Nevertheless, I made only a few snide comments before returning the microphone. As I started to step down from the stage, I was surprised to be met with a sizable applause. It was the loudest shout the audience had produced all night, though the acoustics of the stage @MONTH1 have influenced its volume. It was quite clear that the audience had found what they were looking for in me, and I found myself remembering @CAPS4 teacher's words once again. ""The audience doesn't just come for the jokes, they come for the person. Anyone can be a comedian if they can show their interesting side.""",43.0,7.0
8,"  Everything in life that is worth is not easy to achieve. Sometimes you have to try something you've never done before or do something you don't want to do to get the reward or outcome that you want. @CAPS4 was a hot @DATE1 day in the middle of @DATE2. My friend @PERSON1 called me and said that him and his brother are going to a swimming spot called blue horn. @CAPS5 said there is cliffs we can jump off and rapids that we can swim down. This sounded very intriguing. I told him I was up for @CAPS4. @CAPS5 picked me up from my house and we made our way to blue horn.  When we first got there i was surprised because we had to go on a two mile hike that @CAPS5 didn't tell me about. I didn't bring any walking shoes all i had with me were some sandals. This was already looking like a terrible day. We started walking down this long trail that had four or five spots where there was a so much deep, @CAPS1 mud that we had to make a separate path through the bushes so we could get around. Then we get to this really steep hill. When i say steep i mean you can't walk down this hill without having to break into a full sprint or try to stop and most likely start tumbling down the hill. @CAPS4 was all dirt and a couple trees on this hill nothing to hold on to. So what we did was slide down to the first tree and then to the second tree which was about halfway down the hill then we just bolted down the rest of the hill. When i got down the hill all i was thinking was how are we supposed to get back up that? A few minutes later we finally reached our destination. I was hot and sweat and ready to swim. I took of my shirt and set my bag down. I walked over to where @PERSON1 was and looked down at the water. At least @NUM1 feet i was thinking, @CAPS2 what i said was ""@CAPS3 this is nothing""""@CAPS4 gets better"" @PERSON1 replied @CAPS5 pointed up to this tree that had a very rigid board nailed onto some branches that appeared to be a support structure for someone to stand on. I was not planning on jumping off of this wooden plank, @CAPS2 then when @PERSON1 did @CAPS4 i was hoping maybe @CAPS4's not so terrifying when your actually up there. I was blatantly wrong every time i looked down at the water @CAPS4 seems as if i were to jump and never hit the ground. I couldn't be a coward and get down so i figured the only way to get down was to by just leaping off bravely. I counted to three and right as i got to three i stepped forward to leap off and i could feel the warm breeze on my face and the adrenaline pumping through my veins. Before i knew @CAPS4 i hit the water and all those heroic and amazing feelings quickly turned to pain and regret. I had managed to land partially on my back. We got out of the water and @PERSON1 saw my back and said ""@CAPS7 your back is so red!"" I was in a lot of pain @CAPS2 through all this pain @CAPS4 was still so much fun while @CAPS4 lasted and we had a good laugh about @CAPS4 all.  Next up was the rapids. We decided to go down these feet first. The water moves very fast so @CAPS4 carries you like you are a tiny leaf. There was rocks that stuck out of the water that we tried to avoid and there were some rocks hidden below the water that we wish we would have avoided. @CAPS4 was so fun @CAPS2 there was also a lot of pain involved. The entire time we were looking over at each other just abrupt in laughter. Once we got down all the rapids there was a miniature waterfall we swam over to this waterfall and climbed to the top took a seat right on top and just started talking about the day. When we first arrived i thought this was a bad idea coming and i wished i would have made an excuse and not came. After all the hiking and all the troubles getting there when we finally arrived at the cliffs i was scared to jump off, @CAPS2 one reason why me and @PERSON1 are such good friends is because we aren't afraid to take risks to have a good time. Sometimes this lands us in a lot of trouble though! In this case we took the risk to throw our bodies off and could seriously injure ourselves just for the laugh and the thrilling experience. Laughter and excitement don't come from sitting on the couch watching @CAPS9 @CAPS4 comes from going out and trying new things and having a good time. To me that is always worth the risk.",40.0,7.0
8," Lets get to the understanding of laughter. All of us should understand the benefit of laughter. For example, someone once said ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 many others would have to agree that laughter is an important part in any relationship. And if your someone to dwell over the word of someone else on a topic that has nothing to do with those people, then get a life. We all can agree relationships get complicated at times. People @MONTH1 think laughter is the least important thing in a relationship. When yes that's good but at times that is also a bad thing. A relationship with little to no laughter incorporated is to me a waist of time. And a relationship with too much laughter incorporated then u mine as well call it a friendship instead of a relationship. So what I am getting at is that, laughter can either make or brake any kind of relationship if you don't be careful.  So for example ill tell you something about my relationship now and my past relationships that laughter had an effect on. The relationship i am in now. Well, me and my girlfriends first attraction to each other had to of been laughter. Laughter was is what got us to be what we are. But then we also had to be able to have those serious times and commitment. They were basically balanced out between natural attraction, to attraction with laughter. And that is why I believe that there has been no rough patches or any major ones at that.  Now lets take some attention to some past relationships. There was this one, were all it was lasted on was laughter. That's all we had to do is laugh when it came time to see each other or anything. Shortly after we had got together the laughter had eventually stop and we noticed none of us knew anything about each other. Then of course it ended. And then some focus on one other. We had little to no laughter at all in our relationship. All we had talked about was ourselves, and once it came down to it that we knew everything or at least most of each other. there was absolutely nothing to talk about at all. And what do u know it ended badly.  I got pretty much nothing else to say but save yourself the trouble, make sure you can have your laughs and serious times with good communication. Without that then i doubt any relationship will last, but that's up to you. If u find your own way, then good for you.",38.0,6.0
8," I have laughed a lot, over movies, jokes and just because something is funny. But one @TIME2 I invited my friend @PERSON1 over to stay the @TIME2. We laughed a lot over something that seems so boring and something that wouldn't be funny to most. But that is what true laughter is when you are with somebody, and something so little can seem funny. When @PERSON1 came over, we were board, finally we found something to do, then we laughed, and laughed and laughed.  The day started out like any other @DATE1, I woke up at around @TIME1, ate breakfast and took a shower. After I had been awake for about and hour I decided that I didn't want to hang out by myself all day so I called my friend @PERSON1 to see @CAPS1 he wanted to come over to hang out and spend the @TIME2 at my house. @PERSON1 said yes and about two hours later he got to my house. When he got to my house we didn't do much just played some video games and watched @CAPS2. But after awhile this got really boring and their was nothing on @CAPS2. We started to debate on what we should do but couldn't come up with a good idea. Around four p.m. I went into my room and we looked for something to do, I grabbed by little @CAPS4 ball and threw it at the roof in hopes to catch it when it came down, the ball had other plans, the ball got caught in the blade of my ceiling fan and was launched across the room. So then we continued to throw the ball at the, fan to see where it would go and what it would hit. Even though this seems boring we now had something to do.  We continued to throw the ball at the fan. Then after a while we started to throw more and more stuff at the fan. We threw everything from key chains to sticks of deodorant at the fan. We discovered that it hurt a little @CAPS1 we got hit by the harder objects so whenever one person threw something the other would protect themselves with blankets and pillows. We were really having fun, the only thing that you could hear was laughter and the whoosh noise as the object flew threw the air and the bang noise as the object hit something in my room. We continued to throw objects for about two and a half to three hours, even @PERSON1's little sister @CAPS5 who was over so @PERSON1's parents didn't have to find a baby sister was having fun, and was throwing stuff and laughing almost as hard as us.  This probably would seem like a boring activity to any other person, but on this day @PERSON1 and I laughed so hard that we were unable to breath and our eyes were watering. We were having so much fun that we didn't even realize how much time had passed what seemed like ten minutes was actually more like a couple of hours. When we finally started to run out of things to throw, we looked at my room which was now looking more like a pig sty then a bedroom due to the wide variety of things that were scattered everywhere. As we looked around at all the things we kept laughing harder and harder. Even though I realized that I would have to clean my room up the next day I was laughing to hard to care, it was more important to me that I was having fun now right now.  I haven't ever laughed as hard as I did the day @PERSON1 came over. To think that a @CAPS4 ball could have started how we spent our evening is crazy. I would never expect something like throwing stuff at a ceiling fan could cause me to laugh so hard. But I have laughed hard before, at movies, jokes and other funny things, but never that hard. Even though it was something that normally wouldn't be funny, it's something that will always seem funny to me. Since me and @PERSON1 were able to laugh at something so little like we did I know that @PERSON1 is a true friend.",37.0,6.0

8," My older brother once wanted my mom and I to come up to @LOCATION1 to visit him. We set a date and decided to go in a couple weeks. Preparing for trips took us forever. This trip wasn't like most trips we've taken in the past, we were driving @CAPS10. This was by far going to be the longest drive I had ever been on. What better way to experience @LOCATION1 for the first time right? My mom has always been bad @CAPS7 time. She's the kind of person that people tell the party's at six thirty @CAPS3 its actually at seven. She said we were going to leave the house by ten am, Which in reality meant a lot later then that. We ended up leaving the house after nine pm. Did I mention my mom has terrible eye sight in the dark? I knew then that I had a long night ahead of me. Ten hours @CAPS10 to be exact. My mom and I brought @CAPS6 much stuff for this drive. Being girls that want to pack everything, because you never know what situation your gonna get in made @CAPS1 difficult for us to @CAPS9 fit in the car.  Finally we got in the car and were on our way to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1. First we had to stop at the store and get ourselves a bunch of junk food, @CAPS1 wouldn't be a road trip without that. After our little pit stop we were really on our way. I was my moms eyes, @CAPS2 every sign along the way. My mom and I talked for hours. Eventually I fell asleep and @CAPS1 was her job to find her way for a little bit while i caught some sleep. @CAPS3 I had fallen asleep we were almost to @LOCATION2 falls and @CAPS1 was midnight, @CAPS3 i woke up @CAPS1 was two am and we were lost. She thought we were going the right way. We were supposed to be over half way @CAPS10 by now, @CAPS4 we were lost in what looked like a forest. @CAPS1 was actually very frightening being in a forest driving at night @CAPS11 two girls, @CAPS5 since we were seeing no signs at all. We decided maybe we'd use one of our cell phones and get help, @CAPS6 we looked at our phones and @CAPS10 was no cell service. We were starting to get terrified taking every turn we cold find @CAPS11 trying to find some trace of town. I kept telling my mom turn back, @CAPS7 all the turns we had made @CAPS1 wouldn't make a difference @CAPS10 was no way we'd be able to find our way back. This like a bad dream. We continued driving for about another half hour. Then decided maybe if we @CAPS11 pull over and go to sleep till @CAPS1 was light out we would have a better chance of finding our way. Sleeping in a dark forest in a little car is a lot scarier than you @MONTH1 imagine. My mom fell asleep, I was glad about that she deserved the sleep we had been driving for a really long time. While she slept I tried to keep myself occupied, @CAPS7 no cell phone service @CAPS1 was kinda difficult to do. I listened to my ipod for a bit, @CAPS9 then I was bored. @CAPS7 @CAPS1 being @CAPS6 scary out, @CAPS10 was no way i was going to be able to fall asleep. @CAPS9 if I was abnormally tired. @CAPS6 I @CAPS11 sat @CAPS10 and let my mind wander for awhile.  @CAPS1 was finally getting light out, I couldn't be happier. @CAPS3 @CAPS1 got completely light I woke up my mom. We put food in our stomachs and decided we should go for a walk. This place wasn't that scary @CAPS3 @CAPS1 was daytime. We walked for a little bit trying to figure out our surroundings. We started seeing if we could pick up some cell phone reception, For we could get my moms @CAPS12 on her phone to help us. @CAPS3 we got back to the car my mom and I needed to start driving again. We @CAPS11 followed the road we were on for a very long time, @CAPS13 of us knew if we were back tracking or if we were going the right way. After awhile we were on a highway! Then after not long on the highway i saw a location sign @CAPS7 a gas station, We took that exit and we were going to ask for directions. We pulled in to the gas station to see where we were and the man told us we were still in @LOCATION2 falls. If you've ever been to @LOCATION2 falls you'd know its a very tiny town you can drive through the whole town in twenty minutes. The fact we were lost @CAPS6 long was hilarious to my mom and I. We both laughed harder than we had in a long time. Laughter is the shortest distance between two people I believe. That laughter we shared really made us closer. ",33.0,6.0

No one didn't know what we were doing in down town til the teacher said, "" @CAPS4 we came to watch a play."" @CAPS5 @CAPS1 walked in @CAPS1 saw many other kids @CAPS2 teachers from different schools. The place was big really big every wall @CAPS2 chair were just so pretty @CAPS2 glamorous. The teacher called everyone's name out @CAPS2 then she lined us up. I was standing next to @LOCATION3, he was talking to @PERSON1 @CAPS2 arguing about what the play was going to be about @CAPS2 i was just there not talking not smiling or laughing just me @CAPS2 my blank face. All the @CAPS4 were walking into the tilted light room everyone making noises laughter arguing gossiping was all around. Every school was looking for there sets @CAPS2 groups. At the end everyone was seated down the room was filled with quietness all over. No one talking everyone just watching for what was going to happened. The lights went off @CAPS2 the actors came to scene. All @CAPS1 could hear in the room was laughter, laughter of joy from watching the funny actors be hilarious. They were just so funny @CAPS1 couldn't stop laughing. The play ended @CAPS2 i was still laughing. @LOCATION3 @CAPS2 i walked out together @CAPS2 we were talking about how the play was so good. He stopped @CAPS2 said, ""I never would of thought that just by laughing so much from a play could bring your boring day to a funny awesome day.""  @CAPS6 that day we know that just by doing or seeing the smallest thing to make us laugh can bring our day to a better more fun day. Especially if theirs laughter involved. @CAPS5 kids we don't really know about getting angry or being sad we know more about having fun @CAPS2 laughing. @CAPS3 someone makes @CAPS1 laugh it just brings your bad day to a better day. Even if its the slightest laughter @CAPS1 can have a better day @CAPS2 besides laughing is good for @CAPS1.     ",40.0,7.0
8," Everybody that I know loves to laugh. They're mostly my boyfriend, my friends, and my family. All my friends and family come together during the @DATE1 and sit around the camp fire. We all look back on the old days and just laugh at all the things that we did. I loved all the stories my mom told about me when I was a little kid because it makes everybody laugh. Even though some of the stories are embarrassing I don't care; I love a good laugh. Plus that's more memories for my friends to remember for the next time we all come together. We try to all come together once a year because were all slowly but surely growing up. So that means were all busy and have no time, but we all try. Some how I always meet new people at the camp fire. Before my boyfriend was in the picture we were just friends. We liked having each others company. When were together we would be laughing most of the time. Our relationship grew each day we spent together. In our relationship laughing is a big element. @CAPS1 was great at telling me jokes to where I would fall to the ground with pain, because by then he knew what I thought was funny. I knew what made @CAPS1 laugh and what he thought was funny too. When every I'm in town with @CAPS1 we always have plans to go see people; either they invited us or when I'm in town. Our friends had told us that they love our company because they're laughing at us or with us. It's all understandable if they laugh at us because we can be a little goofy at times.The one thing that would make he laugh so hard and I just makes me want to hit him; is when i hurt myself and I'm in pain. Instead of helping me and asking if I'm okay he just laugh. For me I just watch him make a mistake. Once he has done that gets mad, hits the something, and then he gets hurt. That right there makes me laugh because his a hot head. When it's time to go see my friends I'm more close to them then @CAPS1 because we have awesome memories. I have several close friends back home and I still keep in touch with them. My old friends and I get so loud around the camp fire just catching up. When @CAPS1 hears all of us laughing he feels felt out because he has no idea what we're talking about. I know he wants to be part of the group. I mean I would probably feel the same if he was laughing with his friends and I had no idea why. I know that I wouldn't like it and just act immature about the situation. So I would call him to come and join us so my girlfriend can tell him why were laughing so hard. As I step back and look at his face I feel good. Just looking at him smiling and being part of the group makes me feel like I'm floating in clouds.  On the other hand laughing is the biggest element in my family. We all like having a good time especially when were all camping. The kind of laughing in my family is laughing at each other. It's kinda wrong, but that's how we are and it's fine with us to a point. If were all camping and there's not a single person talking. My grandma would walk in the middle of the camp fire; look at us and just fart real loud and walk away like nothing had happen. Of course I burst out laughing my lungs out. By me laughing it broke the ice and everyone became chatty. In my moms house you either hear us girls laughing or yelling at each other. My sisters and I have a very special bond. With all my sisters we all have inside jokes with one another. Its great at time because then if there is a disagreement you have someone on your side because of the inside joke. I think that laughter is a big element to any relationship. With your friends you make memories and when you get together you talk about old times. I guarantee you that someone will be laughing. It's a great feeling to laugh with a person. It makes you feel close to that person. With my boyfriend laughter is important to me. Less laughing means to me that there is lots of stress and your not that happy. So without that i would feel incomplete. Laughter is a sense of joy and happiness. It makes everything go easy. When your feeling down and crying; one of your lovely family members will come in and try to make you laugh. Besides laughter is part of the world; have you ever been somewhere where there is people and not hear anyone laughing? I don't think so. It's a everyday thing and its really good for the health.",42.0,7.0
8,"                                      A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The @CAPS3  Many people believe laughter is a vital element in a relationship and I agree. In my case laughter is @CAPS1.A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 silence. A silence that scars not only my mind but my relationship with my beloved father. A silence so dramatically insulting it makes me doubt whether the person to whom I adore is still living in the standing figure I presently have before me. Laughter is our salvation. In the beautiful @DATE1 mornings, when I was a toddler , the ritual of the weekends began. As the clock silently mermered @NUM1 a.m I would navigate through the sea of animal imprinted blankets and dive for the camouflage of my bear blanky. Immediately, crawling as quietly as a @CAPS4 into the spy infested hall. My force field would protect me @CAPS2 attracting any attention toward my direction, so I could accomplish my onerous objective, to scare my father. Finally, I reached the grant room. There he was sleeping, or as many would have already guessed, pretend sleeping. The sound of my tiny feet stumbling on my camouflage blanket always awakened my father. As I sound next to the queens size bed waiting for the perfect moment to attack father would always, at the last minute, raise his left arm. This would leave me in sear astonishment. How could it be, after all my efforts he still manged to hear me? As any toddler would, I would make a fuss before giving into his welcoming jester. Usually, a an inviting cracked smile @CAPS2 my father would make me forgive. I would lay my minuscule body next to his massive body and begin the breathing game. While father tried to to regain his inner peace I, began to exhale and inhale simultaneously with father. I inhaled and would wait for my father to exhale. My lungs sterived for oxygen; yet, I did not dare to breath. My nose began to fall into the temptation of secretly inhaling. To my releaf an exhale form my father would always release me @CAPS2 my torture game. Pretty soon the game would come to an end after I impatiently fought through the exhales and inhales. In the end, father would always notice my inpatients. He would get up, wrapped his mammoth arms around me, and carry me toward the kitchen for my morning chocolate. There we would share our plans for the day.  Presently, when I awaken @CAPS2 my slumber there is no sea of animal imprinted blankets to navigate through, as they have been replaced with gold bed sheets. The ritual of the weekends that once enveloped me with happiness has diminished. The hall way that once anticipated a toddler every morning , now only excepts , in annoyance , that there is no longer a weekends ritual ; only a immature teenager passing through every morning, leaving behind the toddler there had once been. All together, the morning bounding has deseaced. All connection has been buried deep within both of us. It seems that laughter is the only action left that can unbury those ""lost"" emotions. Laughter is one emotion father and I share. When father and I laugh for what ever the reason the connection of father and daughter is restored. It makes us feel like we are back to the days where nothing kept us @CAPS2 being us with each other. The scars vanish and all that remains is us; the figure is reviled. It is my daddy. It is as if the autopilot has been turned off and we can regain control of our emotions. This is a time when what I say to him truly comes @CAPS2 within my @CAPS3, but when the moment has passed autopilot switches to ""on"". The silence that once controlled our being has once again sent one of its dark clouds to silence the @CAPS3 of both of us. The vanished scars reappear as open wounds. Every emotion that was felt in that moment becomes part of the past. The curse of our daily lives has once again begun.",40.0,7.0
8," All my life there has been a part of me missing, an empty hole. What was to be in that hole, I had never known. I remember from the very beginning of my schooling, children would brag about what their fathers did for a living. Such moments were when I would walk away, afraid to answer any dad related questions. I never knew what to say, I was ashamed of him, the empty hole deep inside me. Every girl must have some male role model and each of us learn to make adjustments, find someone else to fill the job requirements when another male has let us down.  @CAPS4, he was my savior, taught me how to deal when the kids would push me down with their words. ""@CAPS1"" ""@CAPS2"" or my personal favorite, ""@CAPS3"". Yet @CAPS4's guidance and belief in me did not fill that emptiness.  Eventually the names grew stronger, more hurtful. They were sharp and painful, leaving me to bleed out and stain the sidewalk.  That is when I learned to laugh. Smile and giggle as I walked away. The @CAPS5 cannot tell that you are afraid when you are laughing, the pulse stops, the brain goes numb, there is no proof to you being alive or dead. I was invincible, indestructible, until that awful, horrifying day, the day that flashes through my mind every time I cry.  A stranger @DATE5 say the day we met was the most monumental day of my life, but that statement would be false. It was not the day I fell for you or the day you said ""I love you"". It was the day when I really laughed. Not out of anger, hate, or fear but out of joy and feeling free with you right by my side, laying in the cold @DATE4 grass watching the puffy white clouds race along the never ending blue track.  That laugh seized all my fears, brought them to a screeching halt. I was not afraid to hold your hand, no longer did I cringe at the feeling of warmth from your golden skin that soothed my chilled bones. In that moment, that short five seconds, a wave of pain mixed with relief washed over me. Tears poured from my eyes and your image of me completely changed. In those, now twenty seconds, you saw me go from solid stone, jello, then to a puddle at your feet. Both of us knew what had happened.  The black hole that was deeper than before was starting to fill, and as it did, a light from beneath my skin began to come through. I was shining, glowing. With this new radiance I lost the huge footsteps that had never matched my quaint physique, the rain was a bit warmer and the breeze, a bit softer. Both of us kept that day a secret, locked in our hearts. Yet there is no doubt in my mind that others did not notice, and if they did, nothing was said. For the first time in my fourteen years, I was able to spread my wings,, showing everyone the golden strength that I had so carefully woven through my feathers.  @NUM1 days of life, out of the hundreds of people I had met, it took one person, a person with a darker story than mine to pull me through the bottomless abyss.  @DATE4 flew by, then came @DATE5, @DATE5 nineteenth, @CAPS6 to @DATE1, @DATE2 tenth...  @DATE1, was hands down the worst day of my life, and it was a day I will never forget. As I held you before you drove nine hundred miles away from all your friends and me, I felt you shake, I felt your body sob against mine. Convulsing, I looked up at those big brown eyes and those freckles that dance when you laugh. I stretched out my arms and wiped away your tears with my icy fingertips. Standing there @CAPS6 that empty street, I could feel that hole growing, digesting every thought and emotion, even taking bits of me, forever lost. Unfortunately, I could not stop you so instead of long goodbye, I pushed you away, forced you to run. I sat there falling to pieces. Why did I not take you with me to celebrate the end of school and the start of @DATE3? The park forced me to remember, the bus was too quite, the ice cream was like my icy fingers against your hot cheeks, and the dentist washed away the taste of disdain. That night was the start of many that I would spend crying myself to sleep. It has been two years and others must think I've healed, but the only reason they see me ""healed"" is due to the fact, I make sure everyone sees that I am fine, sees me laugh and smile. When in all actuallity, every day is hard, everyday the last words I said to you haunt me. ""@CAPS7, it's nice to meet you, I can't wait to spend time with you."" For my motto, never say goodbye.",40.0,7.0
8," I can remember back before high school when stress levels were a lot less then they are now. I remember when I could laugh in class for like three minutes straight and not get a detention but those days have come and gone. Now things are more serious and there is not much time for a good laugh anymore. As for me though, heck I'll laugh all I want I'll take those detentions I'll laugh while getting written up and laugh while sitting in detention I always enjoy a good laugh. Though back to the story I'm supposed to tell, I'm going to tell you about one of the funniest times in my life. Although it might not seem funny to some people it was to me and some of my best friends and here it goes. So it was the end of @DATE1 right before high school and I was having a pretty sweet @DATE1. I stayed right here in @LOCATION3 but it was still fun I kick it with my friends all @DATE1 and went to the skate park and @LOCATION1 and all that good stuff. Anyways, close to the end of @DATE1 things were looking pretty sharp and it looked like freshman year was gonna be great. I didn't expect two of my best friends were going to tell me they were moving. It was my two best friends @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 and I couldn't believe I was losing them. but I wasn't going to let that ruin our @DATE1 though. We decided we were going to celebrate the @DATE2 three weeks and have as much fun as we could before they left and that's what we did. We spent the @DATE2 few weeks going to party's staying out past curfew getting in all kinds of little trouble but we ignored all that trouble we got in cause we were having fun and I know that makes me sound like a bad kid but you'd have to look at it in a little rebellious kids point of view I was just out for some fun, harmless fun. But as the days rolled on it soon grew very close to the end of @DATE1 and our fun grew into more trouble by the time we were down to the @DATE2 I was basically disowned but I didn't care I wanted to have fun and that's exactly what we did. So we continue on with the pursuit of the perfect @DATE1 and partied it up. We even threw a couple of huge party's our selves because I happened to have a lot of money over @DATE1 and they had two empty houses with no one in them. It was one of the best summers I ever had but it ended awkwardly. The @DATE1 before the @DATE1 was the @DATE1 I got to hang with my friends because they were leaving and so that @DATE1 we made the best @DATE1 of @DATE1 we started it at like three o' clock in the @TIME1 and stayed out all @DATE1 having fun going to party's just enjoying the @DATE1. But the night times when it really got interesting we go some fireworks and went around town lighting them off until we got to the store called ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4"" at like @NUM1 in the @TIME1 and we climbed on top of it as one of the @DATE2 things we did. Getting up there actually wasn't that hard but while we were up there the funny stuff happened. We were up there for an hour or two talking bout good memories and raced around the roof top a bit. Though we didn't know that about twenty minutes later we hear a car pull up behind the building and stopped and we peeked over the roof and saw it was a police car and so we freaked out cause we cant run away on a roof. Five minutes later half of @LOCATION2's police force was there and a fire truck and they searched the roof they eventually found us there in the corner and made us climb down the fire truck.When we got to the police station they told us someone called in and said they thought we had a sniper on the roof. But it was all a misunderstanding they realized that when they searched us and the most the found on us was a bag of chips called our parents and as me and my friends sat there we couldn't help but laugh forever cause of how our @DATE2 @DATE1 ended we went out with a bang I guess you could say. But that's how we wanted it to end. In the end I lost two friends but still talk with them I had a crazy @DATE1 story and I turned out to become very popular from all the party's we threw that @DATE1 had made me famous. Now a days I have new friends but me and @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 will always be friends and we still laugh about it every time we talk to each other.",38.0,6.0
8," Laughter is an important part of life, because you don't want to live life all depressed. In my family we love to laugh our butts off, its a way that we know that we're not being uptight or snotty. Some example's to make one another laugh is to tell family stories, make a hilarious joke, or just being yourself and not notice that you did something funny.  First, baby stories or even the telling of a family members memories. Usually @CAPS4's telling the baby stories are the parents or an older sibling's. Then there's the other memories that family members tell about. For instance, my uncle once told about his hunting trip with my dad and my step brother. They were hunting in some kind of valley and all of them were having a couple cans of beer. Then out of nowhere came a white tailed deer. My step brother made the shot and they all thought that they killed the deer, until they were coming up a grade and saw that the deer was starting to stand up in the back of the truck. My step brother was driving the truck and told my dad and uncle to open the widow and smack the deer on the head to knock him out. Neither of them could do so because they were too drunk to reach out and knock out the deer. So my uncle took his gun and made a very lucky shot and got the deer in the head. Then when they came home not one could stop laughing to tell the story of their hunting trip. There's one good story that no one in my family will forget because it's priceless now that a family member from that story is no longer with us.  Second, my family's hilarious joke's but corny @CAPS10. The one member in my family that could tell the best @CAPS10 was my grandfather on my mom's side. @CAPS3 was able to remember all of his @CAPS10 and say some @CAPS10 in the warm springs language. One joke my grandpa told me when i was a little girl was ""@CAPS1 did one tomato say to the other tomato?""... ""@CAPS2!"" @CAPS3 only told me a couple of his @CAPS10 because i was too young to hear his other @CAPS10. But as i got older i heard his other @CAPS10 from my mom, brothers, sisters, and uncle's. Another good person to make @CAPS10 was my dad. They are funny, but they aren't school appropriate. My dad always was telling about his family inside @CAPS10. One that was funny but school appropriate was ""@CAPS4's the best dancer at a @CAPS5 costume party?""... "" The @CAPS6 @CAPS7."" The family got their @CAPS10 either from movies, books, family or friends. The @CAPS6 @CAPS7 joke came from a @CAPS8 of @CAPS10 called The @CAPS8 of @CAPS9 @CAPS10. From that @ORGANIZATION1 movie we made @CAPS10 out of it and resided lines or made @CAPS10 out of those lines.  Last, another way to make each other laugh, was just by being yourself. Like me for instance. I'm always saying ""@CAPS11"" when i can't hear a person talking to me and they'll get mad at me but that doesn't phase me. So the people around us that are able to hear will just laugh at us for having a stupid argument. Or the family will laugh at me because they call me a blond. For example, when someone is telling a joke I'd probably be the last person to get the joke. So they'll laugh at me for being slow at understanding the joke. Or they'll just laugh at anybody @CAPS4's last at understanding the joke. Another way is when a person doesn't do something right, like when they are chopping wood and miss the piece of block, apparently that's funny. Or for no reason my little sister and I will start laughing out of nowhere. Maybe its because we amuse each other or maybe another family member made a funny face. One time my auntie wasn't thinking right and she sat down in a little kid chair that was like a bean bag, and she thought that the chair was a wooden chair. So when she sat down she sank into the bean bag chair and started laughing at her self because she's a blond just like me. Maybe i get my blondness from my auntie.  These are my true stories of time's that make my family. There's the family stories, the hilarious but corny @CAPS10, and there's stories of just being yourself and making a person laugh. But its great to laugh! It shows that your living life not all depressed and crabby, it shows that your living life in an amused way.",41.0,7.0

I always thought that the phrase was just a fake to @CAPS3 kids to laugh more. When I would @CAPS3 hurt @CAPS28 dad would @CAPS19 ""@CAPS3 up son just laugh and rub dirt on it."" The thing was is that i never noticed it was working. I always thought that making someone laugh would help @CAPS8 in: break-ups, @CAPS4 grades but not in pain. I never saw laughter help pain til this faithful accident. It was just a normal night. @CAPS28 brother and I just finished playing on @CAPS5 live a game console we had for @NUM1 months now. When we left we went in his room and I sprayed on some @CAPS6, witch @CAPS28 brother hates the smell. @CAPS18 began to yell at me saying that I just filled his room with unnatural bad smells. So @CAPS12 a idea popped in @CAPS28 head to spray his clothes so that @CAPS18 smells it all the time to piss him off a little, knowing that @CAPS18 would change his clothes @CAPS10 wards. I ran up to him with the @CAPS6 in hand and a brilliant idea I just thought of. When I hit that nozzle @CAPS28 brother started screaming and saying. ""@CAPS8 sprayed @CAPS28 eyes! @CAPS8 sprayed @CAPS28 eyes"" at first i thought @CAPS18 was faking so I didn't worry. @CAPS12 I told him to prove it, @CAPS18 showed me his eye and it had more red on it @CAPS12 the burning sun. I started to worry and @CAPS28 parents were gone. I thought about @CAPS18 calling @NUM2. @CAPS12 i realized that the bottle said, ""@CAPS9 sprayed in eyes wash thermally with water."" @CAPS10 that I rushed to the sink and washed @CAPS28 brothers eye out. When I was finished I asked him, ""@CAPS11 @CAPS8 fine now can @CAPS8 see."" @CAPS12 @CAPS18 answered back, ""ya, just kinda hard to see"" @CAPS12 I stopped being worried for a second and said, ""@CAPS14, @CAPS15 guess @CAPS16"" ""@CAPS16"" ""@CAPS17 butt"" @CAPS18 started to laugh and said back, ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20"" ""@CAPS20"" ""@CAPS17 thigh"" @CAPS12 @CAPS18 started to laugh again and I did too. I noticed that I started to feel a little bit better. I looked at @CAPS28 brother and wondered @CAPS9 @CAPS18 could fully see again, so I asked @CAPS18 replied""@CAPS10 that ya i feel like that didn't even happen."" @CAPS12 i realized that laughter does help when @CAPS8 @CAPS3 hurt. @CAPS28 brother and me started to watch family guy til our parents got home. We laughed and had a good time. When @CAPS28 dad opened the door and said ""@CAPS25 help your mother with the grocerys.""We helped @CAPS28 mom with the grocerys and @CAPS12 we went up stairs to to play the @CAPS5 just a little bit more before heading off to bead. When @CAPS28 dad came in @CAPS28 brothers room @CAPS18 looked at us and asked ""@CAPS27 who sprayed the @CAPS6""   @CAPS28 dad and me looked at @CAPS28 brother and @CAPS18 is holding his eyeball while laughing. I started to laugh and @CAPS28 dad was just clueless. We began telling him the story of @CAPS16 happened at first @CAPS18 got worried, @CAPS12 @CAPS18 started to laugh when @CAPS18 heard @CAPS18 was okay but scared of @CAPS6 for the night. At the dinner table we all began talking about the accident and how @CAPS15 will be forever scared from @CAPS6 spray bottles. @CAPS10 that faithful day I knew that laughter can and will be the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 when sprayed by a @CAPS6 bottle.

8," We had been watching each other for weeks; our eyes had never once met, but we both knew what the other one felt. @CAPS3 wasn't the kind of person I ever expected to like me. @CAPS3 was a popular, good looking, smart, a great athlete, @CAPS7 a year older than me. I was just a quirky girl who, after moving back to the town I had grown up in, couldn't find the place where I once belonged. Something in his eyes though, told me. It was when I was sitting on the bench in @LOCATION1 with my best friend during a game of dodge-ball when she said something about him.  ""@CAPS1,"" she pointed at him. ""@CAPS2't @CAPS3 hot? Coach told him to come @CAPS7 play dodge-ball with us. @CAPS3's was sent from heaven."" ""I know, right?"" I giggled. ""@CAPS3's been staring at me!"" ""@CAPS4 uh!"" ""I swear."" The coach called us back into the game, ""@CAPS5 break!"" I got up, ran onto the court @CAPS7 scaled out my opponents. There was @PERSON1, the kid who loomed over all of us with his tough attitude @CAPS7 huge biceps. Don't get hit by him, I thought. There was the @PERSON2, the shyest girl in our class who couldn't hurt anything even if her life depended on it. Get her out first, was my next mental note. Then I looked to the furthest part of the court @CAPS7 saw @PERSON3 @CAPS7 @PERSON4, the two class clowns who doubled as tough jocks. I'll @CAPS1 out for them, I decided. The coach was counting down now, ""@CAPS6... two... one... GO!"" @CAPS7 with that, we all sprinted to the center line @CAPS7 grabbed what dodge-balls we could @CAPS7 retreated to our spots on the court. Not having retrieved any ammunition to knock out the other team, I found my place on the court as the battle began, but there @CAPS3 was on the other side of the line opposing me. I could feel my heart beating a hundred times a second. I picked up one of the rubber balls that rolled towards my feet @CAPS7 aimed it at him with what I thought was going to be an almighty throw. Instead, it slipped out of my fingers @CAPS7 bounced slowly towards him on the other side of the court.  @CAPS3 picked it up @CAPS7 looked straight at me with a smirk.  I ran backwards to get as far away from his pitch as I could @CAPS7 tripped over my untied shoe lace. Next thing I knew, I was laying face up on the floor with a group of kids staring down at me. There was a fluster of people trying to help me up @CAPS7 asking if I was okay, but before I could answer any of their questions I made eye contact with the boy @CAPS7 let out a giggle. @CAPS3 chuckled @CAPS7 suddenly the two of us had burst out into a fit of laughter at what an clumsy person I had just proven to be. ""I didn't even need to throw the ball at you!"" @CAPS3 said, still laughing. ""I might as well just go sit down on the bench!"" I agreed. After that, even though the idea of even talking to him seemed intimidating, I decided that if we could laugh together then we would probably have a good conversation together.  Now, after a year spending every day with him, making him laugh @CAPS7 him doing the same for me, I remember what I saw in his eyes that day. I saw a person who would change my so far very short life @CAPS7 make it fun @CAPS7 exciting each second. But when this one, fantastic person leaves my life, like everyone will at some point, I will always know when I find a new person to share it with. Not by their looks, or their talents, but by that one moment where our eyes meet @CAPS7 the laughter we share brings us together no matter what. ",41.0,7.0

We weren't to mad about getting up that early because we had jet lag so that was @CAPS8. We hop in the car and go to a beach that @CAPS11 mom had wanted to go to. She read about it in a book and it said that it was the longest and whitest sandy beach of @LOCATION2. She also didn't read the caution flags in the book...soon to your knowledge you will know why. It was a really sunny and hot day which meant PEOPLE...LOTS of people! All had the same idea as us, that was to come to @CAPS10 magnificent beach. There were people walking on the beach, laying there, swimming in the water, body boarding, snorkeling, etc. You could tell if the people that were sitting there relaxing on the beach were people watching. I right at @CAPS10 moment was just taking a nap and getting a tan. I had probably been asleep for about an hour. @CAPS11 parents had gone out to go and try there hand at body boarding. They were out in the water for a good @NUM1 minutes, then I wake up to @CAPS11 moms voice saying ""@CAPS9?! Look, dad hit @CAPS3 head on a rock!"" I looked up and @CAPS11 mom and dad walking towards me with @CAPS11 dad bleeding from the top of @CAPS3 head. Everyone is seeing @CAPS10 whole thing! It wasn't just a little scrape, it was more of a gouge. He sits down and takes a rest, and in about @NUM2 minutes he was out like a light. We didn't think that @CAPS10 was a good thing so we woke him up just to make sure he was okay. He wakes up after an hour and we asked him if he was okay, and he said that @CAPS3 cut just stung a little bit. After we knew that he was okay we laughed for a long time during and after it. Until @CAPS10 day it will come up and our belly's will ache because we laugh so much. It didn't cure all the @CAPS13 for about a month, now there's just a scar that always reminds of it. He was a real trooper! (@CAPS10 isn't the last funny thing he did!)@CAPS11 dad decided that he wanted to @CAPS7 some stuff for the beach like beach towels, a beach chair and we needed more sun tan lotion. We go to @CAPS12 and @CAPS11 dad sees @CAPS10 chair that he wants to @CAPS7. It is one of those ones that is really low to the ground. @CAPS11 dad sets it up and @CAPS7 ready to sit in it and he apparently must not have remembered how low it was to the ground because he just plops right down onto it. He had a ways to fall because of it being such a short chair. As he was going down he hit @CAPS3 head on every single shelf that was behind him. He got bright red and @CAPS11 mom, @PERSON1, and I were busting up laughing. He asked us what we were laughing at and walked off.@CAPS10 trip will be hard to beat! We had so much fun, and so many funny things happened! It would take @CAPS13 more than @NUM3 words to explain them all. One day I will for sure tell @CAPS11 kids about all of these instances.",39.0,6.0
8,"what does laughter do for us?I think laughter has a big role in any kind of relationship,laughing sometime helps making people feel better when their feeling down or if your just hanging out with some friends.Laughing brings a joy to the people your hanging out with,when two people laugh they share a bond between each other,it kinda makes you feel like you have something in common with that other.For instance when im having a bad day,my friends do stupid things to try to cheer me up by making me laugh or smile.Im not sure exactly what it is but laughter makes people feel better and makes their day better.Like when my mother is sad about our bills or how she cant make enough money,i make try to make her laugh so she can stop thinking about all the negative stuff in our life's.laughing is just essential to our life's,it makes life easier.I know some girls in school when there really upset they cry then they laugh to make themselves feel better.I personally enjoy laughing,it brings a good vibe to the room and makes everyone have a joy feeling in their pit of their stomach.i think that if people don't laugh they feel kinda dead inside,i know that i feel quiet and weird if i don't laugh through out the day.Another good reason why laughing is essential to our life's,is when a baby cry's we do anything we can to make it smile or laugh.Its just a big part of us that is there for a reason. But laughing doesn't always make yourself feel good,i think laughing also makes other people around you feel better,it gives off a good vibe that makes you feel happier.You can also use laughing to give a impression that your a good person,like in job interviews when you go in smiling and looking cheerful i think it gives a good first impression then going in looking all sad and depressed.I think when i see a person that i don't know and i just meet them i usually can tell who they are in the first ten minutes of meeting them just by how their personality strikes me.If i meet a new friend and their just sitting there all quiet and laid back i think to myself if that person is hiding something or why arnt they joining in our conversation.I also get the impression that they might be boring to be around,and no one likes to be around boring people. If i go out to the mall or town to hangout with someone i like to have conversations and laughter while we are walking and hanging out if a person never laughs then i think they are quiet most of the time and they are anti social.Even with my mom,when we go out,we share a few laughs,me and my mother are pretty close to,if we don't have a conversation here and there she tends to think im fading away from her.Im growing up now so i have to communicate with her a lot more or she is gonna think im trying to desert her.And making jokes and laughing is what keeps us together even through all the stuff we go through in our life's.So to me this is how i see it,laughing is a big part of our life's and ourselves in general,its what makes us who we are,so if your someone who doesn't enjoy laughter or jokes i think you have a part missing out of you. Laughter isn't always for fun too,sometimes its used to make fun of people,like for example little kids making fun of each other by laughing at one kid to make him feel low.Some people laugh sarcastically to piss people off,laughter can be used in all different kinds of situations.For example,im in my house with some of my friends and we're sitting on my couch in my room playing black ops and laughing at the kids that are loosing to make them more mad after each round.I like to laugh,im usually with a group of kids that make me laugh and like to joke around a lot.Being with someone that is funny is a lot better than hanging out with someone that is always sad and depressed all the time.I mean if im sad one day,the friends i have will cheer me up or make me laugh to make me feel better and forget what was wrong in the beginning.I have a cousin that is @NUM1 and she is a big cry baby,if she doesn't get what she wants she will flip out and start crying.So i have to do something stupid or something to make her laugh or she will cry forever.So i think laughter has a lot to do with us being who we are today,if you don't have a good sense of humor then life isn't gonna be so easy for you.",40.0,7.0
8,"                                     "" Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""  @CAPS1 you ever meet someone and you knew right then that you were going to be friends forever? That's is how my best friend @CAPS2 and I met. It was just like love at first sight, but instead it was best friends forever at first sight. It was ten years ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was five years old and she was six. I had just transferred from @ORGANIZATION1 school. On my first day at @LOCATION1 school, I met @CAPS2. The teachers introduced us and asked @CAPS2 if she would show me around the school. I remember being extremely nervous and I didn't think that I was going to be able to make any new friends. A week went by and @CAPS2 and I got closer and closer. We were always laughing at something. It didn't matter how ridiculous it was, but we would still laugh. Laughing was and still always get us in trouble during class. When that first week of school went by we promised each other that we would be best friends forever no matter what. We got our parents to let us @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. That was a lot of fun! I remember this one time we were playing on the ""spider dome"" and she lost her balance and I was sitting right beside her on the top and she was about to fall, and I grabber her arm hoping that she wouldn't fall, but she pulled me down with her. The first thing that we did as soon as we hit the ground was laugh. The recess duty ladies rushed over to see if we were alright, and we were just laying there on the ground, legs tangled up in one another laughing. They took us to the health center to get bandages, because we scraped out knees and elbows on the way down. The office called our parents and told them what happened because they were inspired by how close of friends were. When I got home I begged my mom to take me to the store so I could get a friendship necklaces for @CAPS2 and I, and she finally took me. I picked our a pink heart broke in half.One half said best and the other half said friend. It looked like it had been broke right down the middle. That basically means I'm not complete without you. Each half of the heart fits together like a puzzle. Unfortunately we were at the river one hot @DATE2 day and we both lost our necklaces in the water and we spent the longest time looking for them, they were never found. Now we @CAPS1 matching necklaces but they are sterling silver with the letter k on it hanging from a chain. We chose the letter k because my name is @CAPS7, and hers is @CAPS2. We wear them everyday. I'm fifteen now and she is sixteen years old and it seems like everyday we become closer and closer. We still @CAPS1 slumber parties almost every weekend. We are on our high school @CAPS9 team together. I love @CAPS2 like a sister. Shes family and I don't know what I would do with out her. We @CAPS1 a anniversary ever @DATE1, because that's the month we met ten years ago. When you @CAPS1 a best friend and he or she is like family, don't let anything become between you two. People don't need more than one really close friend in my opinion. I had three close girlfriends at one time, but it didn't work out. They were all jealous of each other except @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is very laid back and rolls with the flow. Girls are very hard to get along with, that's why I @CAPS1 many more guy friends that girlfriends. Every friend that I @CAPS1 now, I met through laughing at something somewhere along the road. I am a very happy, giggly, free spirited person that likes talking to people and if that person that I talk to and they're shy I'll will most likely get them to laugh somehow. That's me take it or leave it.",36.0,6.0
8,"She couldn't contain it anymore, it fianlly came out in a burst of laughter. She couldn't help but laugh at the expression on his face, to her it was priceless. He always made her laugh, and she could never figur out why. Was it his smile, or his eyes? She could never figure out why no matter how hard she tried. But she loved how he could just make it come out of her. They hadn't been together for a real long time, but just long enough to know each other very well. It's like they were best friends before ever meeting. they botha had amazing athletic abilitys, personality, and they always had family and friends there for support. They had a connection that could be sent through them like a text message or a I.M message. Both were honest, reliable, and had great respect for those around them, but most importantly for each other. They made time for each other but also for others as well, they had alot of fun with groups more often than any. What made it fun was they knew how to laugh. They both believed that knowing how to laugh was just as important as all the other key points in a healthy relationship. John and @PERSON1 were pretty serious before they had started dating. Serious about their sports, academics, and of course family and friends. They didnt really know how to have fun until they met. It's like they had forgotten how to laugh. But with them coming together and learning how to have fun and laugh, while staying focused on what was important, they can do other things to. realizing that having fun and laughing through each other, that it was critical for them in their relationship. Laughing showed them that the farthest people in a relatonship, can grow as close as anything can get with the small thing called laughter. As their relationship grew they begain to have a ton of fun with their friends and each other, it helped them more and more with family relatonships. I think that laughing is a daily part of someones life, and that it's healthy for people to laugh, even at the smallest things. I know personally that it strengthens relationships, breaks ice in an awkward moment, and adds contrast to the everyday painted picture. It's like a new color, or a brighter one to life. It becomes a major part in work, social life, growing up and just the random small things that are thrown at us everyday. We can laugh at old mistakes, at memory's or when we do or see something funny, it's just a everyday reaction. It's all part of our thought and learning process of experiencing new things. I think it can help us find who we are inside and who we can be when we grow older and more mature. I think, laughing is also just one of our natural reactions. Not just to something fun ny, but just to other things that might trigger a memory, or a time you were getting yelled at and afterwards thought it was funny, or knowing you made a dumb mistake. I personally know that I laugh at myself for something I did or said or just something I got in trouble for by a silly mistake. The fact remains as it is; ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". It does help relationships, it brings the two people together closer than anything. If we didnt know how to laugh or have fun, I think this world would be very dull and boring, and everyone would just end up hating or strongly disliking alot of things. It's healthly to laugh and also have fun with it. It's all over the world being experienced by millions of people. and it's also one of the key points to a healthy relationship. To me, it's like and oreo cookie and milk, or a two piece, or pencil and paper. No doubt that laughter is what fits perfectly together with everything in the world, and also life. And that if can go anywhere and anytime. So go ahead, have yourself a good laugh today and have it bring you closer with someone.",42.0,7.0
8," It was the @DATE1 and my friend @CAPS1 and I were on our way to @CAPS2 valley to shoot some sage rats with his dad @ORGANIZATION1. it was late at night because we left on a @DATE3 so we could hunt that @DATE2 @TIME1. @CAPS1 and i were very tiered because we had just got done playing a baseball game so most of the time we slept and every once and a while we would stop and get food or i would wake up but all together it was a really boring ride.  We finally got there it was about one in the @TIME1 but we did it. when we got there their was some people out side of the lodge standing by a huge bonfire so we walked over and said hi to the other hunters. after all that @ORGANIZATION1 stayed over there while @CAPS1 and i had to unpack all of our hunting gear and clothes. we definitely were complaining the whole time because we wanted to go hang out with all the guys by the fire, but we still did all the work and got it done then went by the fire of course by this time every one had left and went to bed but we had slept the whole way here so we weren't tiered. so to have a little fun we took the quads out for a little night drive and scope out where we would be hunting the first part of the day as we were driving through the fields we saw some eyes in the distance and couldn't tell what it was so we drove really slow up to the eyes and when we got closer the eyes started to move away from us so we started to speed up till it was a full on race. finally they stopped and what we saw blew our minds it was by far the biggest deer i had ever seen in was a monster four point and right beside it was another big three point @CAPS1 and i both stopped right there in our tracks and watched them till they took off we sat there a little while longer just because we couldn't believe what we had just seen. as we sat there he looked over to me and jokingly said i think a just wet my self and i said ya me to that was huge. we sat there a little while longer talking about how fast there were going and how many holes we had to dodge then we slowly drove back to the lodge and went to bed. the next @TIME1 we woke up nice and early ate some breakfast then went out to go hunting and hunted all day it was a blast hanging out with each other and shooting crap we went through so much ammo and had such bad sun burns it was crazy. that night we hung out with our new friends and told stories about fishing and hunting and all the stupid thing we had done then every one kinda went to bed because the next @TIME1 we had to get ready to leave.  that next @TIME1 we all slept in a little bit mostly because we didn't want to leave but we knew we had to so we all got up and started to pack up. and left it wasn't as bad of a drive on the way back because we were telling jokes and laughing the whole way back the funniest part of the drive was we brought these marshmallow guns and were shooting signs and stuff and to see who could come the closest but around lunch time we came up to this food place and went through the drive in and when the lady took our money she went to go get the food and left the window slightly open so i made a bet with @CAPS1 that i could shoot a marshmallow though the window as soon as i shot i knew there was trouble because right behind the window was a cup of coffee and i hit it and it spilled all over the floor it made us laugh so hard after we left. This trip all together brought kyles and my friendship closer with all the jokes and funny stories. i cant wait to go again but this time i don't know if i am making that bet again we might get in trouble. next time we go i am sure we will have lots more laughs and a ton more stories to tell.",34.0,6.0
8," Laughter is key @ORGANIZATION1 friendship. Laughter is salubrious @ORGANIZATION1 any relationship. A simple joke or act of gawkiness can lead @ORGANIZATION1 a parade of laughter. My friendships all began this way. Some more memorable than others. The friendships I hold tight @DATE2 are my most memorable. I remember the day I met my best friend who turned out @ORGANIZATION1 be my cousin I have never meet before in @NUM1 grade. I am now in @NUM2 grade and our friendship is still strong. We do everything together. Just like most friendships we have minor disagreements, nothing serious, but that same day we talk it out just like how everyone should. We experienced our first rock concert in @DATE3 together. A day we both will never forget. She comes @ORGANIZATION1 my house a lot. One day, we were watching music videos in my living room. I saw something funny I had @ORGANIZATION1 show her. So I ran up from the couch @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS1 and my cell phone was in my pocket. It was dead silent in my house. When I got up from the couch we heard the theme @ORGANIZATION1 The @CAPS2. It was slow and calm. We had a puzzled look on our faces. I then realized that it was my phones @CAPS3 @DATE1. I took it out of my pocket and shut it off. We both started laughing. It was so funny @ORGANIZATION1 us because it was silent then all you hear is the flute playing from my pocket. This happened @DATE1, and @ORGANIZATION1 this day we still talk about it. Let me rewind back @ORGANIZATION1 my @NUM3 grade year. I met most of my good friends during this change from @ORGANIZATION1. My good friend @CAPS4 is amazing @ORGANIZATION1 this day just as I met her. We had all the same classes. We never talked until the @ORGANIZATION1 of the year in math class. I sat behind a eccentric boy named @CAPS5, across from him sat @CAPS4. She was quiet I didn't hear her talk much. One day, my friend made a miniature paper crane. Small enough that it can sit on your thumb nail. It was sitting on my binder when @CAPS5 took it and started @ORGANIZATION1 examine it. This caught @CAPS4's attention and she started @ORGANIZATION1 talk @ORGANIZATION1 me if I made it or not. Before I could answer @CAPS5 then stuffed it in @CAPS10 mouth. I was completely shocked. @CAPS13 spit it out and started @ORGANIZATION1 play with it even more. @CAPS13 called it ""@CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12"" @CAPS13 would throw it and toss it, while I tried @ORGANIZATION1 get it from him. @CAPS13 tossed it up so high it landed on top of the lights we had in class that was above him. @CAPS4 and I looked at each other and started @ORGANIZATION1 laugh, and so did @CAPS5. @CAPS13 apologized for what @CAPS13 did. I didn't mind it. I had another one in my bag in my locker anyway. This started the friendship I treasure. Its been @NUM4 @DATE1 since that occurred. We still talk about that day.  Laughter is just as important @ORGANIZATION1 a friendship and also @ORGANIZATION1 keep families together. My family is odd. Just like everyone's family. My mom is a lot like myself. She doesn't joke like me and my dad do, but over all like me. My @CAPS12 is so funny. @CAPS13 is younger than I am by @DATE1 @DATE1. @CAPS13 makes my mom and I laugh a lot. @CAPS13 can imitate voices such as: The @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 the @CAPS17 @CAPS18, and just weird sounding voices in general. My @CAPS12 and I used @ORGANIZATION1 not get along very well, but now we don't fight like we used @ORGANIZATION1 anymore. I'm glad we don't. Laughter is an amazing thing of life. It makes things worth the ride, even if your dreadfully falling or taking the wrong dusty long road in this world. As long as you have someone by your side making you laugh, everything will be fine. I love my friends and family for making my life worth the ride so far, I can't think of how this world will be with out the musical sound of laughter. It would be dull, and have no reason @ORGANIZATION1 be on this earth we call home. I will not be in high @ORGANIZATION1 for long. I might not know all the friends I have @DATE2. So, I never hold grudges, I make amends easily if they are willing. I want my high @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1 @ORGANIZATION1 be wonderful. So far I am having fun laughing and never forgetting the day I laughed so hard I cried. Once I am ""All @CAPS20 up"" I'll look back and remember how much I loved high @ORGANIZATION1 yet I hated it, the drama kills me. It wont matter in ten @DATE1 maybe even one year.

Laughing helps a child in need of love and nourishment, and it helps an adult find the beauty in the world. Every since I was a little girl my parents always told me that laughing is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and that if I were to show one emotion my entire life, it should be laughing. I took this great advice under consideration my past @NUM1 years and now everyday I laugh, doesn't matter what kind of mood I'm in, I always laugh with either a friend who told a funny joke or just that the sun came out when the weather reports said that it was going to be raining all day, I laugh and enjoy the life I have been blessed with. There is one specific story that I remember @CAPS7 so well because it was one of the @CAPS2 stories of my life and it in fact involves my @CAPS2 friend @PERSON1 and I laughing our heads off. The day started off being a cold, dark, stormy day on the @ORGANIZATION1, even though it was @DATE1. Typical considering the @ORGANIZATION1 only experiences at least two months of @DATE1 because of the terrible weather we have all the time. My mother, sister, @PERSON1 and I were off to @LOCATION1's capital, @CAPS4 for a weekend away and school shopping. My favorite time of the year I must say. @PERSON1 and I were in the back seat of my mother's car singing ""rain rain go away, come back another day...""@CAPS5 what seemed like a life time all of us were over the mountains and through the woods to find ourselves in @CAPS4. I was literally jumping around in the car waiting to get out and start shopping! Except, that was not what my mother had planned for us to do that day. Her plan was to go to the hotel, get checked in, put our luggage into the rooms, go out to eat, then come back and relax and just wait til the @CAPS1 day to go shopping and have fun. ""@CAPS7 man, her face was priceless,"" says @PERSON1, who is still currently my @CAPS2 friend. I was definitely mad about the plans of the day, and my mother could tell already that that day was going to be horrific. I hate to admit this, but I'm the type of person who wants everything to go their way, and if someone else has something to say, well lets just say that that's not going to be a pretty sight. I ended up doing what my mother planned and trust me I was dying inside. By sunset, I was definitely on edge and all I wanted to do was ignore everyone and go to bed. But luckily my trustworthy friend pulled me aside because she knows how to calm me down and told me that when we get back to the hotel we were going to do something crazy. Which of course we did, because we always do something crazy even if we aren't meaning to. @CAPS8 I was freaking out about what we were going to do, I could see little gears inside @PERSON1's head that were turning very quickly @CAPS8 she came up with ideas. Once we got back to the hotel room, I was just @CAPS8 shocked @CAPS8 my mother and my sister when @PERSON1 picked up a table and put it on top of our bed that we were sharing. She then said ""wanna play some poker and eat tootsie rolls?"" I looked over at my mom, she was wide eyed and mouth opened, I immediately said to @PERSON1 ""I'll get the cards! You can get the chairs on the bed and I'll also get the tootsie rolls!"" @CAPS8 I ran out to the car, I could hear my mother saying to my sister that this wasn't such a good idea, but there was nothing else to do so why not right? All you could hear was @PERSON1 and I screaming about almost falling off the bed in the chairs, or winning the most tootsie rolls, or even on how much fun and terrifying it was to be playing poker on a bed in chairs that were wobbling ever five second. The night got even better when @PERSON1 almost fell backwards and she then she literally peed her pants! Her face was deep red @CAPS8 we both laughed our heads off! She didn't even take this experience of wetting her pants humiliating. We both just laughed and laughed for the rest of the night and I've never let her forget this memory which sounds harsh, but it's to hilarious not to forget! @PERSON1 and I have definitely kept that memory in the books along with many more. And sure, it is pretty humiliating to wet your pants in front of your @CAPS2 friend but it still made the night great! I also remind her that I was laughing with her, not at her because I would probably do the same @CAPS3.",43.0,7.0
8," When I was in fifth grade, it seemed anything anyone said was funny. A time I remember the most was when I went to my friend @CAPS1's house for her birthday party. We were in fifth grade and all the girls in my class were invited.  @CAPS1 was tuning eleven and her birthday was a big deal. We had been talking about everything we would do at it that week. We were going to watch scary movies, play hide and seek, and then stay up all night. Staying up all night and watching scary movies when you were in fifth grade was a big deal and we all wanted to do it. The day had finally come. @CAPS1's birthday was the day @DATE1 break started. We all rode the bus together talking and laughing about boys and all the silly stuff we did that day. We grabbed our bags, hopped off the bus and ran down @CAPS1's driveway to her house.  When we got there @CAPS1's mom, @ORGANIZATION1 had bought candy for us and was making sure we ate it. She wanted us to be hyper for the day part of @CAPS1's birthday party, but wanted us to crash by the night so she could get some sleep because she had to work the next day. Her idea didn't work very well for her, we were up all night making noise, talking, and laughing. We sang her happy birthday, and ate our cake but there was a lot left over.  @ORGANIZATION1 didn't want it taking up room in her refrigerator so she told @CAPS1 to go get something out of her room. When she was gone @ORGANIZATION1 told us to each grab a piece of cake and we were going to throw it at her. When she came back in the room she was so surprised when she got about eight pieces of cake thrown in her face. We started a full on food fight and had so much fun. With cake in our hair and all over the floor we went outside and used the hose to get it off of us as @ORGANIZATION1 cleaned the cake covered floor. After our food fight we played some board games and talked more, which led to us laughing more and more. We decided we wanted to watch the scary movie now and everyone was really anxious but nervous. All six of us sat on the couch huddled together as the movie started. By the end of the movie @PERSON1 was too scared to even go to the bathroom by herself so, so she had to have someone go to the bathroom with her. After many screams and a lot of laughter the scary movie was over, and decided to go out and play hide and go seek. We got into our groups of two and started. After about an hour we were getting kind of bored of the game, my friend and I decided we should go scare other people hiding because everyone was still scared from the movie. So our innocent game of hide and go seek turned into who can scare who the most. We went inside had hot chocolate and laughed about what all had happened that day. I'm in eleventh grade now and we are all still friends to this day. Sometimes we'll sit at our school lunch table and laugh about her party to this day.",34.0,6.0
8,"To explain any important aspect of a relationship would have to come from a personal experience from that person in which they have had a relationship that depended on such things like ""laughter"". Here is a short story from which I had a relationship that depended on ""laughter"" and also other important aspects for a relationship. As I grew up I experienced different types of dating there was the verbally abusive ones, very thankful and happy ones that ended with dishonesty and heartbreak, and of course your typical ""puppy love"" relationships. Although I personally never came across a relationship in which laughter became an importance at that point in time I had thought that I met a girl we had many things in common such as we loved hanging out with our friends, visiting our family and relatives, the same taste in music which was ""@CAPS1 oldies"" and ""@CAPS1 rap"" types of songs that are able to explain our lives and not the type of songs in which they were just a thing to listen to because everyone else was. A few of our differences would be that I grew up old school I was raised to be a good man always treating my significant other with the respect she deserved and to be the man of the relationship which would fall under being there for her whenever she needed me no matter the circumstances, loving her through thick and thin etc. The ways I treated her were different to her somewhat new she never really had a man that treated her as an equal a little bit of her background would be that she was raised thinking every man was the same in every way they all cheated, they all hurt her both physically and mentally and most of all that she would never get the respect she deserved. For her to think like that and be raised in that particular environment was devastating for a person like myself to actually believe and to turn away from a girl like that would to me not be the wisest decision. As time went on things got bad just like any mature relationship we had gone threw a hard time of her father passing away directly after mine and her birthday's also an old relationship floating to the surface interfering with our relationship although we had gone threw tough times we still managed to stick together. Not very many people have that such luck or type of love when they're young the amazing thing that helped us through our hard times were love, respect, honor, and surprisingly ""laughter"". Our love started earlier than a typical mature adult relationship even though we showed and said we loved each other it grew stronger by every day that passed we both never let a day go by without showing and proving our love to each other no matter the situation even to this day. The respect and honor were more of an automatic type of thing for us we both grew up learning to always respect and honor our significant other it was a matter of importance if you didn't respect or honor the person you were in a relationship with than in our eyes the chances of it lasting are very slim. How laughter is surprising is because we would argue a minimum four times a day everyday, for a couple to argue that many times a day over the smallest things personally is unhealthy in any relationship. The laughter being a very important thing is because no matter how angry we get towards one another something always happens or is said that makes us laugh, for the both of us we love each others laugh the way I laugh to her is she knows I'm not always serious and I can be a very kind, funny, sweet, and caring man. How I love her laugh is because it isn't necessarily a laugh it is more like a sweet giggle that tells she is also very sweet, funny, caring, and has so very much love for her significant other. I can recall a time which laughter came into play there was a time I had said something wrong not really wrong but it had been said in the worst possible way in saying that we started to argue and fight saying things that weren't meant to come out. Just like anyone else that is angry they say certain things that are very hurtful and wouldn't normally be said when they are in a calm state of mind. Although we had said very hurtful words to one another we had stopped talking to each other for the entire day, later that evening I had gotten a phone call from her nothing was said for almost ten minutes till we both apologized said we loved each other as soon as that was said I hit my head with a remote by accident we both laughed from then on our relationship was repaired then on and that's how laughter became an importance for us.",40.0,7.0
8,"                            Freshmen @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is a something that happened my freshman year of high school during @CAPS1 season. My team had a great season that year. my side of the offensive line was the one of the best groups of guys to play with. We didn't lose a game that year and we thought we were untouchable. Everyone thought that we were to full of our selves at the school even though we never let ourselves get big heads from winning all the time.  Going back the line during every play of the game we would have to tell the guy next to me who he was supposed to block. The guy across the line from him would always look at us like we were idiots for tell him who to block because the guy that he would be blocking would think he could get around him. The defender never had a chance in any of our games trapper was way to fast off the ball for him to even react and the only thing he saw most of the time was the sky. We always got a kick out of it because it was always the same thing every game and everyone underestimated him each and every time. He looked like he was weak and couldn't move anything but he was built like a @CAPS3 truck and after the first play of the game that kid never wanted to see him again in his life, but he got hit each and every play. Even when the subbed someone in for that poor kid the same thing happened. Our team after every win would have a kid do the truffle shuffle and he did it perfectly. We played as one big unit and had each others back when we faced adversity we would hunker down and play even harder no matter the situation. I loved playing with that group of guys we got along great and I miss those days when it didn't matter how we did we just had lots of fun. We were one of the best teams in the state that year and we knew that and had no problem telling people that. That season was my favorite so far but the only thing that would make it better would be wining a state championship.",30.0,5.0
8," Its a long flight down to @LOCATION2, total it takes about @NUM1 hours from door to door. My grandparents live there and we try to visit them every two years. There are @MONTH1 things to do down there, we surf with my uncle and ride motor cycles. My grandparents have a sail boat and sometimes we go out on there boat snorkeling. I remember a day when we decided to make the @NUM2 minute drive to @LOCATION1 and see if the waves where small enough for me and my family to surf. When we got there the waves where big, it was a medium size for @LOCATION1 but that @LOCATION1 can have waves that are big enough you could fit your whole house in the barrel. We sat up on the top of the cliff next to the the path down to the @LOCATION1, the tide was dropping and if we didn't go out soon the rocks and coral would start to come out of the water and that could be a problem for all of us.  I ran back to the car and put on my wet suit, the water there is warm but not so warm that you can spend an hour or two in just your swimsuit. My board was leaning agents the fence next to the cliff, it's @NUM3, @NUM4"", wide in the middle and light blue, my favorite board. I snatched it up and ran down the trail to the @LOCATION1, I had to beat my brother onto the water.   The water was shallow only about two feet deep in some spots, the sea weed was tall enough to reach the surface and the paddle out was hard, after about @NUM5 yard the bottom dropped away and I could see the beautiful coral bottom below me. I was starting to get into the waves now, duck diving the first five or six, the waves where gradually getting bigger. I paddled off to the left away form the point where the waves hadn't broken yet. The ocean was a light blue and perfectly clear.  I final made it out back, I sat down on my board and looked back toward the @LOCATION1, my brother and my uncle paddling out, they had just passed the weeds. up on the hill I saw my mom and dad, they looked like dots on the horizon, it was a long paddle. I decided to wait for my brother and uncle to get to me before I caught some waves.  My brother caught the first wave of the day as usual, he always paddles for every wave, even if there not the best. He got an @CAPS1 ride, head bobbing up and down behind the wave made me laugh. I look behind me to see if there where any waves coming, there was a big set, the waves we had been waiting for, I paddled out deeper so that the wave wouldn't crash on my head and crush me. My uncle let me have it he would get plenty of waves later. I was in perfect position of the second wave, I turned around and paddled as hard as I could, the wave shot under me and picked me up. ""you got it,"" my uncle yelled. I stood up quick, jumping straight to my feet, standing on top of the wave I could see the coral bottom about three feet below the surface. In some spots as the wave sucked up the water, the rocks came through the surface. I had to stay near the top of the wave to avoid hitting them. My brother was watching me, I turned back up the face of the wave and bounced my board off the lip as it started to curl back toward me. Baring off I turned back down the face to gain speed then went for the big jump. I flew off the top of the wave and dove over the back of the foaming mass. We stayed there and surfed for about an hour and a half, the tide got to low so we came in. I stood on the bluff watching the waves rolling over the reef and the swell hitting the point and sending up a cloud of spray. As I took off my wet suit I thought back to the day that had passed, surfing with my family, great waves, in a beautiful place with amazing people. I sat on the fence and looked out over the ocean, the reflection of the sun on the horizon, the sky was a light purple color with hints of blue and red, the reef was glowing under the surface of the water. I sat on that fence and smiled, then laughed thinking of the fun days to come.",34.0,6.0
8," It was a cloudy day in the small town I lived in, perfect if you ask me. A slight chill in the air, the smell of a thunderstorm soon approaching, and not many people on the streets. These were my favorite kinds of days. Sunny days are nice too, but I prefer the slight cold and the peaceful feeling I get from the looming clouds overhead. I decided to spend this perfect day with my best friend, @PERSON1. He and I had been best friends all our lives, and I know he would appreciate the day just as much as I did. I walked to his house, and from there we walked to the park. We sat on the swings and talked for hours. After awhile, the subject matter got to be a bit difficult. @PERSON1's mother had been battling addiction for a long time, and she had relapsed once again, leaving @PERSON1 to care for the house and his younger siblings alone. His paychecks already went mostly towards his family's needs, but it wasn't going to be enough to support them all completely. I had been making some good money at the time, and offered to help. @PERSON1's reaction was not at all what I expected.  He sat silent for a moment, just staring at me with a cold expression in his eyes. When he finally spoke, his words stung me like a slap in the face. ""I dont need your pity money. I can do it on my own."" I didn't know what to say. I couldn't have spoken a word, anyway, due to the swelling lump in my throat. When I finally swallowed down the pain, I told him that I would never pity him, and that I had no idea where he could've gotten that impression from. I had always tried to help when things got rough, just like he had always helped me through the hard times in my life. We were there for eachother, no matter what. That's the way it had always been. I asked him why he would say something like that, and he told me that he didn't need me. I didn't know what else to say or do, so I just got up and left. I walked all the way home by myself. He made no attempt to come after me or apolagize. He just sat on the swing, staring at the ground. A light rain began to fall as I walked, the cold raindrops mixing with the warm tears on my cheek. I was grateful for the rain because it hid the fact that I was crying, for the most part. @PERSON1 and I didn't talk for weeks after that. It was really hard for me, because he was really my only friend. Then, on a @DATE1 @TIME1, a knock came at the door. I opened it to find @PERSON1 on my porch. I resisted the urge to smile and hug him and tell him how much I missed him. Instead, I just stood there staring, waiting for him to speak. He said nothing, but pulled a picture from his back pocket and gave it to me. It was of he and I when we were very little kids, at his birthday party. We were playing with his new boxing gloves. I was punching him in the face when the picture was taken. On the back of the picture he had written, ""@CAPS1 sorry, I dont know what I was thinking. I've still got the gloves ... You deserve a free shot.""  I couldn't hold the smile back any longer after that. When I reterned my gaze to @PERSON1, he was holding the small, red boxing gloves that he had gotten that day. I burst out laughing and hugged him. He hugged me back, and we stayed like that for a few minutes. I invited him into my house, and we were back to our normal selves again. We spent the rest of the @TIME1 goofing off and laughing and just having fun. The disagreement was forgotten, and we were best friends again.  They say that laughter heals all wounds, and after that @TIME1 I believed it. The hurt that I had felt dissappeared, replaced by happiness. @PERSON1 allowed me to help him out with his money problems, and together we held the house down for his mother until she got clean again.",36.0,6.0
8," Laughter is a @CAPS1 part in my life. Laughing makes you feel better. Its all around a good time. When you laugh it either means one of many things. @NUM1.) Someone is trying to cheer you up. @NUM2.) @CAPS2 just plain funny and @NUM3.) @CAPS3 are @CAPS2 so dumb, its funny. In fact I try and laugh everyday. Just recently i had been hanging out with a couple friends and we all walked away with some memories. @CAPS9 is what happened..  Last @DATE1 @CAPS4 and I were sitting on my couch when @PERSON3 called asking if i wanted to hangout. i said ""@CAPS5, but i have @CAPS4 with me."" @CAPS7 we were hanging out downtown his brother, @LOCATION2, called. He asked ""what are you guys doing?"" and if @PERSON2 would come pick @LOCATION2 and a couple friends up to hang out for a while. We went to pick him up @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, @PERSON4, and @ORGANIZATION1, to give them a ride to meet up with a friend.  @CAPS7 we are waiting for there friend to show up, @CAPS9 random crazy lady gets out of the car parked next to us. She starts walking around the car extra slow and everyone in the car is confused on whats going on. Oddly enough @LOCATION2 friend pulled up at the same time. @PERSON1, @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON4, and @LOCATION2 all jumped in that car. @CAPS3 drove off and then @PERSON2, @CAPS4, and I pulled out of the parking lot and went to get something to eat. Mainly because that lady creeped us all out. It was kind of a ""you had to be there"" type deal. We all laugh and make jokes about it to @CAPS9 day. Its going on a week now and all of us are still cracking up about it. I think that my life is basiced around laughter. I could tell you at least twenty funny story if you asked right now.  Oh, one more thing about laughing and things you and other people @MONTH1 not think about to often, @CAPS2 funny comes from @CAPS2 random and enjoying life, saying to yourself when you first wake up, ""@CAPS9 is gonna be a good day."" Laughter is a huge part of my life. i think its a healthy thing to laugh everyday at least twice, and if you laugh more then that thats awesome your an extra healthy person. ",35.0,6.0
8,"                                @ORGANIZATION1!!   The best part about having friends is that you can all laugh together. We all know how @CAPS6 feels to be laughed at and sometimes @CAPS6 hurts your feelings, but most of the time you can laugh along with them. Like the time that I was at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We were all hanging out and having a great time when @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @CAPS6 came on. We all started dancing and my friend @CAPS7 @CAPS3 locked and ripped @CAPS6. @CAPS6 was so funny and every one was laughing. We went to the bathroom with her so that she could put @PERSON2's shorts on under her pants. Then when she was done we all went back out and started dancing again. And about every ten minutes she would say ""i feel a breeze on my butt"". Then we all would laugh.  About week later @LOCATION1, @CAPS8, and I mad a rap group called @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS6's our very own way to tease and make @CAPS7 mad. Every day since then @CAPS8 says @CAPS3 or @CAPS12 and @PERSON1 says @CAPS4 or @CAPS14 and I say @CAPS15 @CAPS6 or @CAPS16. @CAPS8 even mad a rap about @CAPS6. @CAPS6 is very funny but @CAPS7 hates @CAPS6.   I think that laughter made this all so much more fun and exciting. Now even @CAPS7 can laugh at her self when we talk about @CAPS6. She has grown a lot though the laughter. I think that every one can grow from laughter and more importantly from laughing at them selves. I also think that the laughter brought all of us closer together. Especially @CAPS8, @LOCATION1, and I.   I am extremely happy that this happened because @PERSON1 and I used to not be friends and now we are best friends. And a lot of laughter made that happen. The one thing that we can always laugh about is that night. Although @PERSON1 couldn't go to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because she was sick. @CAPS8 and I on the other hand have been friends since the day we met. All that night did for us was bring us closer. Which was such a good thing. We all became better friends from all of the laughter and the great times that @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and other days have brought.",31.0,5.0
8,"Everyone knows the benefit of laughter, whether its with your family, friends, or even by yourself, we all laugh. I usually laugh at everything and all the time. I am one of those girls that laughs about everything even when i don't mean to. Sometimes i even laugh alone out of the middle of no where and sometimes at the wrong times. but the main time i laugh is when i am with my cheer team. i have three of my best friends on there so we make everything fun and enjoyable. i remember this one time we were coming back from a game at horizon christian and the tea stopped at taco bell and @PERSON3's in new berg, @CAPS1, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2 and our coach went into @PERSON3's and @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 decided to be funny and ask if they had any job openings, the guy laughed and said, ""what do you have to offer us?"" and i told him that i could have a smile on my face all the time and i could be peppy and brighten up everyone's day. then @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 started cheering and doing round offs while cheering for @ORGANIZATION1. @PERSON2 and our coach were so embarrassed!

8,"My best friend in the entire world when I was in @NUM1 to @NUM2 grade, well he is still my best friend he is just in a much better place, was a boy named @CAPS1. He was my friend because he was the most fun to be around. This kid would do anything to make you laugh. Sometimes he didn't even have to try because he was very clumsy and not very coordinated. One night my family and I were over at his families house and we had decided to play a video game because it had gotten to dark. It was so long ago I don't remember what game exactly, but he loved it. You could tell this by his super long tongue coming out to touch the tip of his nose. This meant he was concentrating really hard on what he was doing and when he concentrated on anything that meant he liked it. This face he made was so funny to me I turned blue trying to hide my laughter from him so I could get a secret picture of it. I snapped the picture and the flash got his attention. Needless to say he tackled me, all @NUM3 ft @NUM4 lbs of him. I had wrestled him many times before and had gotten pretty skilled in my escape techniques. I got away quickly, camera in hand. Before he could stop me I had shown our parents the amazing picture. In his embarrassment, he ran to his room acting like he had been deeply hurt while poorly hiding the huge grin that spread from one ear to the other. We heard the door slam but we were all still laughing hysterically. After a few seconds we hear his loud heavy foot falls come running out of the hall way. He thought it would be really funny to run out of the hallway and power-slide in his socks out the front door and onto the deck, were our mothers had been standing talking. The problem with this is our mothers had shut the front door because of the insects getting in the house. In mid power-slide he realized this, but he could not stop himself from sliding at his top speed right in to the heavy wooden front door of their house. When @CAPS1 hit he rattled the entire house! The windows shook and I could feel the vibration of him landing on the floor flat on his back. No one laughed for fear he @MONTH1 have hurt himself. he laid gasping for air so it was logical to think it was because the force of hitting the door or ground had knocked the breath from him. When we crowded around asking if he was alright we noticed his face was red and he was laughing so hard tears had formed in his eyes and leaked out onto the hardwood floor. The sight of him laughing so hard brought the whole house in to a fit of laughter! Everyone was doubled over clutching their stomachs, faces purple, and tears streaming from our eyes. The night ended on that happy note. It was well past eleven on a @DATE1 @TIME1 the children had school in the @TIME2. my parents loaded my sister and I into the green dodge pick up truck with no room in the back seat and we drove from @CAPS3 to @LOCATION1 tired and happy. This was one of the best days of my life. @CAPS1 was an amazing person with the most, in my opinion, to live for. I love him and still talk to him every night when I pray. At least I still have the amazing memories from a childhood we shared.",36.0,6.0
8," Hey there my name is @LOCATION1 and i chose to write about a time that me and my four friends chose to make an adventure to the cemetery. It was hilarious and memorable at the same time. Well the day started off as any other day got up got ready for school and was out the door. When I got to school my best friend @CAPS1 was waiting outside. So I went with her through the breakfast line so she could get something to eat. Then we went to are class cause we had first period together. After class was over we ran into are friend @PERSON2. @CAPS1 asked him if he could give us a ride after school to our house and he said yes. Well the day went on and on. Finally it was the end of the school day and it was time for @CAPS1, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and me to start are adventure. First of all, instead of @CAPS1 and me going home we decided that we wanted to hangout with the boys. So went over are friend @PERSON3's house for a few hours and were hanging out playing games and listening to music. So after those few hours passed by @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 decided that we should take an adventure to the cemetery down the road. @CAPS1 and I were all over it. So we got in the car and head to the cemetery. So on are way to get to the cemetery you have to go down a gravel road. Well @PERSON2 decided instead of go @NUM1 @CAPS4 like any normal person would he decided that he was going to speed up. So as we were flying down this gravel road and we were near the end. Out of no where there was a sharp corner. Well @CAPS1 and me didn't know it was there but the boys did. @PERSON2 pulled his emergency break and thought we would just drift around the corner. Well think again @PERSON2 lost control of the car and almost slammed me into a huge tree.  Finally we got to the spot that we were going and we parked the car and then out of no where @CAPS1 decided that she needed to use the restroom. We all started laughing and @PERSON1 said there are no bathrooms up here. So she decided that she was going to just go behind a tree, but she wanted me to go with her, so I did. Well as she was going to the bathroom she looked at me and said, do you hear that, and said, yes. We both hear what sounded like someone with a chainsaw coming up the side of the hill. Well she was done and we both took off running to the car. We got to the car and @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 decided that it would be funny to lock the car doors. @CAPS1 and me were almost in tears case we thought we were going to get murdered, but they finally unlocked the doors and we sat there for a little while waiting to see if anyone was going to come up the hill with a chainsaw. In conclusion, you @MONTH1 not think its that funny cause at the time I was scared out of my mind, but looking back on it, it was one of the best times I had ever spent with the tree of them. So that was my funny story and I hope you enjoy it.  ",33.0,6.0
8,"                          From @CAPS1 to Laughter  Laughter can lighten up any situation, whether it being after an argument with a certain someone, or during a day of deception and complete disaster. Experiencing moments of disgrace, one always seems to look for a way to up lift their state of @CAPS1 or glum moments, even when they can not see any resolution to their problems. Even when one appears to have no sense in life, a certain event could switch things around unexpectedly.  I always appeared to have disagreements with people, especially with my older sister. We can never agree on who is right or accept when we are wrong. We can never give in into the others ideas or listen to what we have to say. Even though she is the older sister, I tried to compete at her level, and out smart with what I learned or out stand her accomplishments. Our sister bonding time became a competition, mainly for me to prove my intelligence and agility in areas I knew she was weak in.  After a long exhausting week of school, we both road on the bus home together. We always tried to sit on different seats, and maintain our distance so that other people could not compare or tell that we were sisters. My curly hair set me apart from what I thought to be black, lifeless hair of her's. Unfortunately, more of the high-school students decided to ride our bus, and jam pack each seat, causing for us to sit together. Clutter together like a pair of sardines, we shoved and pushed on each turn the bus made on the corners of the way home. To make things worse, she decided I were to sit next to the window were I was suffocated, and compressed like a chew toy.  Finally reaching our stop, I gained my strength back to push her out off the seat, reaching for air, stuffy from the other people's sweat, and make my way of the bus. I could move freely, but I felt my sisters presences behind me. She was furious from what I had done to her and I knew I wasn't going to be able to get away with it. As I quickly made my way home, I could hear her stubby, short legs creeping behind me. She was rapidly catching up to me with her stubby short legs that seemed to burst in motion, carrying her little body in great speed towards me. My neck was beginning to drip sweat, and I could feel my adrenaline rushing through my body, down to the tips of my fingers. Without expecting it, I was soon on the ground with pressure of someone on top of me. She had tackled me to the cement pavement, and was flapping her arms on top of me. I was shocked of the force she had, and was a bit afraid of how to react since she could never catch up to me when I was escaping her wrath. Not even a minute later, she was squirming on the ground, full of laughter. Her eyes were now a bit red and watery, and was bursting out with chuckles that became contagious. From the sight of seeing her laugh, I could not contain myself, and joined in with her happiness even though I was not aware why she was reacting in such a way. To see her little body that had knocked me down to the ground like a bowling pin, gave me thoughts of how powerful @CAPS1 could be. She was a weak target at this point, but my body became weak when I joined in to her sound of high pitch hollers. Moments after we could speak with clarity, I gathered myself up, and helped my sister to her feet. I was confused if she was still angry or had my sympathetic fall amused her to the point where she had became indulged with joy. I could have remained mad, since she had tackled my to the ground, but why waste a moment of happiness and let frustration ruin a wonderful opportunity to let things flow smoothly and forget about our problems. The air had become lighter and easier to take in, and my walk was steady and relaxing. We had a situation that apparently would have caused a fighter greater than any war fought over acts that were not over thought. If either one of us restrained our self to a laughter that caused for us to get into a moment of peace, we could have been arguing for days. We both knew we could not remain angery for such a reaction on both of our parts, instead we walked home and enjoyed the moment. Such a sound with expressions that are amusing to watch and can become contagious, can cause for a tense moment of @CAPS1 to become an unexpected, up lifting bond between two sisters. Laughter can be full of tears, not necessary tears of disappointment, rather feels of great satisfaction and glee.",44.0,7.0
8," about two years ago I experienced something quite stressful with my aunt, and my younger brother. At the time it was impossible to find funny, but now I can't help but to giggle just a little bit. In the end I feel it has made my relationship with my aunt stronger, only because we both know that at times when things are not what you would call pleasant we can turn around and laugh about it later. This is a story were laughter was an element of on event that wasn't necessarily funny.  One gray and rainy day a few years ago, my aunt, my little brother, and myself were at the store buying food for the next days thanksgiving dinner. I wasn't in the best of moods because my three year old brother was acting hysterical over a silly spider-man toy that both my aunt and I both refused to buy him. I felt bad that I couldn't buy it for him but I was and unemployed fifteen year old, what more can I say. Because the little guy was denied his desired action figure he was angry. By the time we were at the car he had settled down a whole lot, but he was still upset. My aunt gets stressed real easily so when she is trying to get an angry three year old to calm down the whole time were in the store she's not going to be what you would call cheerful, and when she is not happy she turns to cigarettes, unhealthy I know. So after i buckled up my brother in his car seat and my aunt and I put the groceries in the car, my aunt set her keys on the front seat. Me being the goof that that I am locked all the doors to the car! I was outside talking to my aunt while she smoked and neither of us realized that I had just locked an angry three year old in the vehicle. When she was done smoking, she tried opening the door, and that is when @CAPS1 (my little brother) realized he was locked in the car. My aunt said, ""@CAPS1 unlock the door please"" he is a smart boy so he knew what she was talking about, so instead of doing what she asked he stuck his tongue out, then said no shaking his head! We both continued to try to get @CAPS1 to unlock the door. Around the tenth time we asked him, he decided to open the ash tray where my aunt had some pennies, and then i guess he thought it would be funny to eat one! My aunt started to cry after he swallowed the second penny. At that point i was definitely in a horrible mood. What we didn't notice through all the chaos was that there was a lock smith right across the street. Me and my aunt where sitting on the curb after we had given up, and this man came up to us and and asked us what was wrong. After we told him what was wrong, the nice man explained that he was a locksmith and he worked across the street, he also told us he would unlock the car for free! Now i know that there is nothing funny about this story. The part that really counts is two people can turn a stressful moment and laugh about it later. Oh yea if you are wondering @CAPS1 was fine after digesting two pennies. I will always remember that day and how i can still laugh about it now.",38.0,6.0
8," When your young you never really want to listen to your parents or teachers, although they are right @PERCENT1 of the time. My mother would say this to me whenever i would tell my mom about someone I didnt like, or thoght was annoying or mean. The saying was ""laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" I personalally am a very strong beliver in this saying, because it has personally made an impact on my life today. Yes, this was part of that @PERCENT1 of when my parents were correct. For that I am thankfull. If my mother didnt say that to me I would not have the best friend I have today. In @DATE2 I attented a camp during the @DATE1 for all girls that was out in the woods with cabins and fun actvities. It wasnt really like camping because there was electricty and showers. Anyway at the camp you got to sign up with one other girl before arriveing but you will end up being in a cabin with at least @NUM1 other girls. In my cabin there was this girl that would cry like all the time and didn reaslly want to do anything fun. So being a @NUM2 year old girl I didnt really like her and just tried my best to stay away from her at all costs. During free time I wanted to go swiming in the pool but I had forgoten my towel up in my cabin and me and my friend were already down at the pool, so i told my friends to just get in and I will hurry back up the hill to the cabin to get my towle. When getting back to my cabin I was out of breath and convenunly forgot my waterbottel at the pool. Exsaperated @CAPS1 on my bed not realizing that @PERSON1, the crying girl was in the cabin. To my shock she offered her water to me. Although not wanting to talk to her, I took the water and thanked her. We slowly started to get to talking and i found out that she was actually pretty ammusing. We laugh for a while together then desided to go back down and swim together. We were inseperable. After we talked that one day she never cried at camp again and we even remand best of friends through out the whole @DATE1.  Before school was getting ready to be in session again, @PERSON1 told me that the resion she cried so much at camp is because her parents devorce became final the week before and it hit her harder that she thought it would have. She thought that if she just stayed to her self and wasnt very outgoing that people would not notice she was hurt and just ignor her. She also told me that if i had never started talking to her and saying jokes and funny things that had happened she never would have opened up to me and camp would have been the longest seven days of her life. This makes me realize that for her laughter was the difrence between us and that with me and my hummor i was able to make a friend but also help someone deal with all the problems she was facing. Thanks to my mother telling this simple, yet important saying my life was changed for the better. @PERSON1 and I are still best of friends today. This shows that laughter is so important in any realtionship. Weather in a friend way like mine and @CAPS2 or in a family realtionship in @LOCATION1 with her parents.",37.0,6.0
8," Laughter, the sound that people make when hearing or sighting something funny or just brightens someones day. I think laughter is important in the human life because its the cure for having a bad day. @CAPS1 can brighten someones day or save someone from jumping off a building. I'm going to tell you a story where laughter saved my life. Have you ever lost someone or something close to you and feel empty inside? I was two years old. My dad always talked about getting a dog. My father and I bought him as a puppy at a small farm in sandy @ORGANIZATION2. We where on are way back from a beautiful day skiing on @LOCATION1. We drove through sandy and saw a sign that said ""new born golden labs."" @CAPS1 was the perfect opportunity for us because we wanted a golden lab. We walked into the old fashion red barn and scoped out all the new puppies. But one caught my eye. this one ran up to me and gave a little high pitched bark that was unbearable to handle. I immediately said to my dad ""I want this one daddy."" @CAPS2 knew I connected with this dog. We surprised my mom with our new investment. She disliked dogs, but for some reason she connected with this one. What was most important to my mom was that @PERSON1 would always make me laugh, and when I was mad @CAPS2 would always cheer me up by licking me or just doing funny things. For an example I was mad because a friend couldn't come over. @CAPS2 jumped up on my bed with his chew toy and dropped @CAPS1 on my lap. I threw the toy and @CAPS1 landed right next to the wall. @CAPS2 ran after @CAPS1 like a cheetah on wheels and slammed right into the wall by the chew toy. @CAPS2 ran so fast that @CAPS2 couldn't stop right away. @CAPS1 made me crack up laughing and put me in a better mood. @CAPS2 was also special to us because of his nickname. His nickname was slobber dog because @CAPS2 would always have slobber flowing out of his mouth. That also made my family laugh.  Fourteen years later we find @ORGANIZATION1 still with us. @CAPS2 was @NUM1 years old in doggy years and about fifteen years old in human years. You don't realize how important something is until its gone. Sadly year after @CAPS2 passed away. @CAPS2 couldn't withstand the winter. @CAPS2 had no muscle to keep himself warm, and @CAPS2 would always shiver. @CAPS2 was a very happy dog, life was good for him. After @CAPS2 passed my dad and i where hurt because @CAPS2 was such an important miracle to us. We needed laughter in our lives to cheer us up and there was one special person to do that. My mom hated seeing us sad. My mom sat down with us and we all had a group discussion. She told us just to remember the good times. We talked about all the funny and good times we had with @PERSON1, which made us laugh and put us in a better mood. I then realized that @PERSON1 is in a better place and that @CAPS2 will be with us forever. After this experience I realized that laughter can do a lot of things to help people. @CAPS1 helped me cheer up from a loss that i would have never wanted to happen, and made me realize that @CAPS2 is in a better place. Even though I loved him and did not want him to go, I don't regret having him in my life.",38.0,6.0
8," Laughter is like a spark, you never know if it will lead to something better or if it will die once it gets going. The sound of laughter can go anyway, it can lead to a good friendship or start a pointless rivalry. If people can talk to each other then that's good but if two people can laugh with each other then that's even better. Just by laughing I have made many friends with the most unexpected people. In a lot of situations laughter has been a big part. I know a lot of people but I can't really say that they are friends but then there are the real friends. Real friends are the ones that you like being around, the ones that you talk and laugh with. Not that long ago I became friends with someone I already knew of but didn't really k now the person just by laughing. Personally I would have never thought that I would end up such good friends with this person but it happened. Bored, wondering around I bumped in to someone that I knew of and started talking then I heard something that I personally thought was funny then I heard the person next to me laughing with me some what shocked. Once we both stopped laughing we started talking and talking about whatever was on our minds at the time. While just rambling on and on we realized that we had a lot stuff in common, pretty much everything from music to hobbies. As we went on we started dancing and just letting loose. We talked like we have known each other our whole lives and just meeting up after being separated for five years even though we just started talking an hour before. It was kind of weird at the same time because of how we were able to read each other like a book. The talking lasted a while then we just started laughing again about how much we had in common. Back and forth, talking and laughing to each other nonstop. Ever since then we have grown closer to each other each day, hanging out and just going with it. Now that we have gotten to talk to each other, we understand each other just as well as we know ourselves. One minute we were just two people but since then we became two friends just by laughing. The sound of laughter can lead to anything depending on how someone reacts or responds to it. Talk to more people, get to know them, laugh with them and see what happens. I learned what laughter can do and glad I did. Laughter was the perfect spark because it lead to something great and exciting. Anything is possible as long as you can laugh about it with someone.",38.0,6.0

8," laughter       Laughter is a good element in everyone's life, for many reasons. Making friends and staying healthy. I believe that your life without laughter would be boring, and uneventful. like everyone laughter turns my day around. I remember, not too long ago I was having the worst day I've ever had. Started when I woke up late and ended up being tardy for school. My family was yelling @CAPS2 me. I just needed a good class period to turn that bad luck around. That class happened to be social studies, @NUM1 period. I sat by two of my best friends, since we were having a free period that day, meaning that we could talk and basically do whatever we wanted; and we did. We laughed and had a great time!  Some of the most compelling evidence that laughter is good for you is @CAPS1. @CAPS1 shows that overall laughter is a positive aspect for your health, and in your life. Without laughter additionally you can become depressed. I think of laughing as a sign of being happy. So without being happy your sad. To sad can become depression. On the positive side laughing has it's good aspects. Laughing can give you great, strong muscles! This strengthens, or creates muscle, because when your laughing it penetrates and flexes the muscles in your stomach.  Another point that benefits you in laughing is that is gives you more confidence when communicating with people and interacting. If you don't laugh you could come across not friendly. That person would not want to hangout with a none friendly person outside of work, and school. This goes for shy people as well, you have to be confident in whatever ,and everything you do. If your partaking in a conversation, with laughter you and the person communicating with you will be more confident, it also makes you more engaged in the conversation. I think smiling goes the same way. When you approach someone smiling ,their going to think, ""hey this girl is friendly, lets approach her!"" @CAPS2 school, classmates tend to ignore the students that don't look friendly. Laughing ,and smiling build character and with out it people will try to avoid you, also your not going to appear ,or feel as healthy. Laughing is an element that shows both on the inside and on the outside.  See laughing has a lot of good aspects, and impacts in everyone's life. If your not very talkative and you don't laugh a lot there's a possibility that you could get depression, and be unhappy for the rest of your life. There's also the possibility that people and your school mates are avoiding you because you don't look as friendly and approachable. As I mentioned earlier you could be facing some health problems in the near future. So the next person that wants to approach you and have a converstation do it! It could only change your life in positive ways!",36.0,6.0
8," Do you ever laugh when your mad, sad or just because it's fun? Well I laugh constantly, In fact laughter plays a big role in my life. Even as my grades collide with football, and the time spent with my girlfriend isn't that long. I still find the time to put my worries behind me and laugh with my friends. I always enjoy hearing jokes and playing funny games because in my opinion laughter is what holds this crazy world together.  Laughter led to the most amazing relationship for me, with the girl I now call my girlfriend. No mater what we are doing or how we are feeling there's always room to throw a laugh around and lighten the mood. One thing I've lured in the months with this beautiful girl is that even in the most painful and stressful times you never know when its time to start laughing. Laughter also brought me closer to my dad in many occasions. My least favorite time of laughter was last month. My girlfriend and I where having a hard time dealing with stress and I thought the world was going to come crashing down on top of me. I was sure that nothing I said could ever revive her mood, until something extraordinary happened. I tripped over my shoe lace and implanted my face into the arm of her dads rusty, old, metal chair. Her laugh was so unpredictable and mean that I didn't know what to say. To this day I still don't know why she would laugh at me, but truthfully, I don't care because she was happy and full of joy.  My favorite time of laughter was about a year ago when we had an absolutely terrifying wind storm. The power was out and every thing in the freezer was going to though out if we didn't go turn the generator on. We needed to go out side under old oak trees that could plummet to the ground at any time and carry the three-hundred pound generator back to the garage. I sat and watched as the branches where flying through the air knowing if I got hit by one I'd be out cold. But i know if i did i could help save all the meat in the freezer. I got ready at the front door with my dad and then sprung from the door strait to the generator. As I was running I got hit by three twigs in my eye, cheek, and my ice cold ear. Once we made it to the garage safely I shut the door and waited for my dad to start the generator. I could see the relief in his face knowing that he did that with out dieing. After wards we went back into the house and sat down and out of nowhere my dad looked at me and started laughing. I couldn't help but to laugh too. Honestly, I don't know why it was my favorite time of laughter but it will always be deep in my memories. Most would agree that laughter is the ice to the worlds cream. It brings people together in hard times and in most cases is used to keep your mind off of the negative things in life. So whether it's being used as a stress reliever or your just having fun with your friends remember to laugh and have a fun filled time doing it time doing it.    ",36.0,6.0
8," @CAPS1 camping story  @CAPS1 famiy and I had decided to go on a camping trip to @CAPS1 cabin. We had all figured that that a week there would be long enough. So the packing had began. We packed things such as cloths, food, games you know the usual camping suplies. @CAPS1 dad and I loaded the car by ourself's with no help from @CAPS1 two sisters. @CAPS1 dad and i had finally finished packing the car and off it was to elk city, witch is where the cabin is of cource.  The trip down there wasnt too bad. We made it to elk city in just an hour. When we got to the cabin there was no time for fulling around we got straight to seting up our things and putting everything we packed into the cabin. After a day of swiming and a day of fishing I started to get bord. I could tell everyone else was getting bord also just by the look on there faces. @CAPS1 dad had what he thought was a good idea to tell jokes but failed trying to tell them. The next step to stop this bordness was to make camp names. ""@CAPS2 a great idea"" said @CAPS1 dad. But if you know @CAPS1 family you know that if we come up with camp names they ar'nt going to be your everyday camp names. Just like how @CAPS1 camp name was sliver ass because of the fact that when i was fishing i slid down a wooden dock and happened to catch a sliver. Luckly for me it was easy to get out but boy did i get alot of crap about it.  @CAPS1 dad's was dingle berry because of one of the lame jokes that he told about dingle berry's. @CAPS1 oldest sister's camp name happened to be fat ass. I feel really bad about having to call her that camp name. It was the only camp name that we could think of for her. The main reason we gave her that camp name was because of how mad she would get over us calling her that.  The almost youngest, @CAPS1 sister that happens to be six minutes older than me. Her camp name was very special as some would say. It was camel toe because of the bathing suit that she wore the first day that we went swiming. @CAPS1 family and I all tryed to tell her that her bathing suit was to small but she just would'nt listen @CAPS2 why she got the name that she did.  Michelle ""camel toe"" as we would call her at the cabin really hated her camp name but so did everyone else. I think @CAPS2 why it was so much fun to make camp names. Camel toe, dingle berry, fat ass and myself sliver ass still tell this day laugh about this camping trip. This was one of our most interesting and funnyest camping adventures that we have exsperenced yet.   ",35.0,6.0
8,"i am going to tell u about this one time when i was camping and a tragedy happened that i didn't think was to funny but everyone else around thought it was the funniest thing ever.  It all started on one @DATE2 day when my dad came home from work and put out the idea of camping, now i don't know about everyone else but i love camping and was excited and totally with him on the matter so we planned the day we were going to go and who was all going and what time we were going to head out on our adventure to the woods. now we decided we were going to leave that @DATE1 and that me, my dad, his girlfriend, and her two kids were going to be the ones that were going on the camping trip and that we were going to leave real early @DATE3 @TIME2.  Now come @DATE3 me and my dad got up real early like we had planned and we got all our camping gear out and got the car all loaded and were just waiting for his girlfriend and her kids to show up and as u all know waiting for a girl is not fun they take forever to do anything and they normally do it wrong so u wait all that time just to have to go back and fix whatever they did wrong. finally at about noon they showed up and we all left and headed on our way to the campsite which was about two hours away which made it even longer to start our adventure. by the time we got there it was around four o'clock in the @TIME1 and it was starting to get dark so we got camp set up and we got a fire going hung out for a @CAPS1 while then went to sleep.  The next @TIME2 when i woke up my dad and his girlfriend were asleep and just myself and her kids were up and since a stacked a lot of wood on the fire the night before it was still lit and since it was still going and we were hungry we decided we were going to roast marshmallows. now after i have already eating like five marshmallow i had to go to the bathroom so i asked my dads girlfriends son if he would keep an eye my marshmallow while i went to the bathroom and he said @PERSON1 and that it was no problem but obviously it was a problem because when i came back my marshmallow was on fire so i grabbed the stick and started shaking it to get it to go out and just when it was almost out the marshmallow came off the stick came back and stuck to my forehead so i ran and jumped in the freezing creek that was about twenty feet away.  About a half hour after the little incident happened and my dads girlfriends kids were done laughing my dad woke up and asked what was going on and why the hell it was so noisy when he turned his head towards the creek and seen me standing there constantly dipping my head in the water then he started to laugh to and asked what i was doing then when i looked up and he saw how my forehead was burned and how bad it was he then grabbed the first aid kit and and told me that he will doctor me up.  While he was doctoring me up he asked what happened and i told him then i said that i never wanna eat or be around marshmallows and fire again. ",34.0,6.0
8," laughter, one of the many elements when around other people is laughter. Its the bond between yourself and others. it makes people feel happy and allows you to feel comfortable. Without laughter, there would be less communication and less happiness. laughter makes friends, forms relationships and makes everyone happy. Making friends would be real hard without laughter because people do not want to be around others who are always serious. Almost all of my friends where made by laughter. On the first day of freshmen @DATE1, I had to stay after school and wait for a ride. While waiting a girl walked by and i said something funny to her and she laughed. She then sat down next to me on the bench and we talked for about a hour. The whole time we laughed and had a really good time. Sometimes, all it takes to make friends is to make them smile and laugh. Making friends with anyone is easy when there is laughter. You could tell a joke or just say something that is funny. I had an aerobics class at the beginning of this @DATE1 and I did not have any friends in that class so I had to make friend in order for this class to be a privilege and not a punishment. So I went up to this cute girl and I said something nice to her and she laughed. We then hung out every day in that class. Laughter builds bonds and makes friends forever. Laughter is also a way of cheering people up. It rises peoples hopes from the ground. It also rises self confidence. At the end of @DATE1, this one girl that i knew was crying and i asked her what was wrong. She said that her boyfriend just dumped her. I make her laugh a little bit and ten minutes later she was happy again and we hung out the rest of the day. We then later when out. All people need to be happy is a good laugh. When growing up I realized that all it takes to make people happy is making them laugh. laughing is a key part of humanity. with out laughter what differs up from monkeys or fish. So do us a favor and save a laugh and make a friend.",36.0,6.0
8,"I remember telling @CAPS14 brother that ""a day without laughter, is a day wasted"" because without laughter, we can't enjoy are life, knowing what we are missing. So I was showing @CAPS14 brother a video from @CAPS1, showing the funny parts. Like at the beginning where the intro it says ""Once upon a time, there was a kid name @PERSON1, and he made..."" he began coughing, then started over. @CAPS9 part that's funny, was he found a random button he said ""@CAPS2... an inconspicuous large red button, I should imagine no repercussion can happen on further pressing it... There, well I'm off"" after that it said 'meanwhile, in @LOCATION1' a @CAPS3 with a goofy grin said ""@CAPS4 I am so bored aye, I think I'll go ride a moose, I sure love riding @CAPS14..."" his head imploded (it just disappear, with a pop. nothing special). Next I saw the guy @PERSON2 singing ""@CAPS4, I'm just walking along in a random @CAPS13 void, looking for an interesting plot development"" then a big talking @CAPS6 shows up.""hello, hi there, howdy"" @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS4 @CAPS14 god"" @CAPS6 said ""that's right, I am thee, who am be me for he be she"" ""all right. can you move out to the side please?"" @PERSON2 said.""no I cannot"" @CAPS6 said.""why not?"" @PERSON2 said.""for you see, I am an @NUM1hole"" @CAPS6 said. (sorry for that)""aw, I see. well I'll suppose I'll @CAPS5!!"" @PERSON2 pushed the @CAPS6 hard. the @CAPS6 is falling into a blender.""@CAPS4 no, I appear to be falling, I can honestly say, I did not see that coming"" he's lemonade. Next @PERSON2 went into a fish market looking for fish, he went next to this fish vendor ""excuse me @MONTH1 I have some fish?""the guy said ""@CAPS7!!! you @MONTH1 not partake with @CAPS14 delicious fish! I mean yes""""uhh, i don't see any fish, but a carrot""""...that's because there @CAPS8!! to thee escape pods!"" he runs away""...O...K...? well I be going now to, uh @CAPS4 @CAPS14 hairs on fire""@CAPS9 thing I would like to mention, is that @CAPS14 friend modified an air-soft gun's little plastic @CAPS10 into the shape of beans, I said ""you shoot those at @CAPS11!?? what do you shoot @CAPS12 people? Chicken wings? and how about @CAPS13 people? Hot dogs?"" the people around us laughed until their sides ached.You might think @CAPS14 sense of humor seems like slapstick, and insults.

8," The most memorable time that laughter was a part of my life experience was when I met one of my cousins friend she was cute, nice body, really nice and had a great personality. But she was hard to get so my first thing was to get her to laugh @CAPS1 we went on a roller coaster in six flags an wen it stoped my leg was shaking because I am afraid of heights and she started laughing i got shy and didn't know what to do and the first thing I said was @CAPS1 that was fun wasn't it. She replied why are you shaking the ride already stoped an I said @CAPS1 its because I am sitting next to a beautiful girl she blushed an shrugged down and said your cute too. I said so do you want to get something to eat or do you want to get on more rides. She was shy so didn't really like making the decisions so I took her to eat at the court yard we started talking and she seemed to be laughing quite a lot because the jokes and story's I was telling her. I just waned to get her to talk and to feel good around me because I don't really like it wen a girl is shy. After that day I noticed that laughter was one way to get at girls from that day forward I would try to make any cute girl to laugh and tell them sweat things they want to hear you know like the song says ""I am a flirt an I really don't care I tell them women whatever they want hear."" @CAPS1 back to the story I am known for having a smile on my face all the time and making people laugh. Another funny thing was wen me, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @CAPS2 went camping we went on a hike and @CAPS2 waned to prove he was better then the guy from man vs wild so he started eating random plants and insects. Wen we got to this small pond her found deer droppings an he threw one in his mouth an we all gagged and laughed because he had a weird look on his face and he was running around looking for water or something to take the bad taste of his mouth. It was a fun and funny moment we will never forget that was a type of experience wen you meet up with does people again you can remind them about it and have a good laugh. Most people say we are stupid or dum but if they got to know us they will notice that we just like having fun and enjoy life wile we can. Many people need laughter in their life to enjoy it and in brace it. For example my dad and his brother didn't relay get along but on my @NUM1 birthday my uncle came over and I had my dad sit down and talk things out with him. Then wen I turned back and look at them I saw both of them laughing I though to myself what could they be laughing about. So I went over to were they were to see what was going on and they just told me that they fixed their differences and found out that it was some miss understanding from both of them but it was funny and made them laugh and up to this point they still talk about that time and laugh. As you can tell laughter is relay involved in my life i experience it every day its something you cannot avoid because with out it you wont enjoy life the same as living with out it. I like to sit back at times and talk to my friends about our past memory's that broth us all together because they were all funny. Sometimes it offends other people but it doesn't relay matter to us because to us it means having a good time and still being able to hang around with each other with no feelings hurt. I have learn to joke around with people who wont take it seriously or else they will end up mad or @MONTH1 be just would get sad depending on the topic or situation you are in. I could go on talking about all my experiences that involved a lot of laughter but I think some of the story's are not appropriate for this paper I am writing. But I also made a promise to some of the people that are involved that we would never mention it to someone that wasn't involved with it at the time.   ",35.0,6.0
8,"                              A @ORGANIZATION1 puts people on a deeper level when u first meet someone or just hanging around a group of peers. It makes your @ORGANIZATION1 more comfortable and enjoyable. Bring in some funny jokes or actions can make all the peers want to join in on the laughter. Lets say a joke is made while you sit in a group of @ORGANIZATION1. Others will join in after that to keep that going. Laughter cannot be done @ORGANIZATION1 anger; just happiness and amusement can put you in that mood to laugh. In this writing laughter played a great roll in our @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 and I spent together. The night before, @CAPS1 friend, @PERSON2, and I went to a comedic theater to watch some funny skits. We ran into a couple @ORGANIZATION1 there from school and got to talking @ORGANIZATION1 them. Some @ORGANIZATION1 passed @ORGANIZATION1 them and I. We then made plans to ""hang out"" the next day. Laughter put us in that form where we know we have fun together and enjoy each others company. That next day all of the people wanting to come together and spend @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 one another came to have a good @ORGANIZATION1. I decided to head down early to make sure I was there to greet people when they came so I was polite in that aspect. I showed up at @ORGANIZATION2 and waited around till @CAPS1 acquaintance, @PERSON3, arrived. We stood around talking about what we were going to do when the other got there. One of us mentioned that we should run around riding in the carts within the store as a joke. We then laughed about how fun that would be and considered it. The others came up to us making our idea even more tempting, because they showed up @ORGANIZATION1 one in the cart and the other pushing. I then jumped in the cart and yelled at @CAPS2 to get in. He pounced off the ground and landed inside. We were off to the races. As fast as @PERSON3 girlfriend could run, @PERSON4 pushed us down the isles.  Moments passed and we gathered up stuffed animals to sit on as we rode in the carts. Passing people on our left and right, I flung @CAPS1 hands in the air screaming and @CAPS4. The race ended after the group knocked over some merchandise in the store. The manager of the organization came out fairly disgruntled, and she put our fun to rest. She made us remove all the items that got tipped over onto the flooring. She made us replace everything back on the shelves that we removed. Cracking jokes through the whole thing we did so. We then left the @ORGANIZATION2 and made our way across the street to the @ORGANIZATION3 to get a bite to eat. @CAPS1 girlfriend was under @CAPS1 arm and @PERSON4 was under @PERSON3's arm as we strafe our way through the crowded streets. Darkness was brewing at that moment, as the girls began emptying all the salt and pepper shakers on the table. They raced each other to see whose would get empty first as the pepper burnt all of our eyes. @CAPS2 and I sat there in the @ORGANIZATION3 watching @PERSON1 and @PERSON4 shaking the salt and pepper onto the table. After @ORGANIZATION1 passed @CAPS2 got up to get out of the pepper cloud that shot pain into our eyes. I soon followed. Through all this @CAPS4 was all we could manage. The unbelief that struck @PERSON3 was amusing. I had a hard @ORGANIZATION1 comprehending that just happened when we left the condiments just sitting there.  The parking lot is where we wound up @ORGANIZATION1 our hysterical behavior. Dancing took place and it set a romantic mood for both relationships. @CAPS2 and his girl did a little kissing and @PERSON1 and I did some dancing and talking.  @ORGANIZATION2 was where @PERSON3 ride was coming and as mine. So when @ORGANIZATION1 struck to go home we ended at the place where we met to begin this great day. The dancing resulted in us getting close to each other on a person to person level. We all engaged @ORGANIZATION1 each other, and we all spent @ORGANIZATION1 together.  This whole day consisted of this laughter that ended in a deeper thought for one another. @CAPS2 and @PERSON4 have became more close and are looking at moving in together, as for me and @PERSON1, we are still together. That day started us at a new. Which will go down to be remembered for the rest our @ORGANIZATION1 together. As for me and @PERSON3, we met the night before and now are the greatest of @ORGANIZATION1.

Maybe you have family or friends that always know how to make you laugh. In my life i have both friends and family, but mostly friends, that can make me laugh in any situation. My friends and I laugh at things that some people might not think are funny at all, but to us they make us laugh for a long time after it happened. It might be days, or even weeks. Just the other day when my best friend and I were walking down the hall just talking, I ran straight into a pole. I had seen it there, but I didn't think to move out of the way so I would not run into it. With my family we usually only laugh at things that happen when we're all together. Mostly it is when a family member does something funny or says something out of the ordinary. Every time I am with a group of people, it is fun to laugh. it makes me feel a lot closer to them, rather then just being with them and not doing anything. This was a time that laughter was an element of me and my friends.",28.0,5.0
8," Summer of freshman year, I made varsity cheer leading at my @CAPS1; @ORGANIZATION2. Every year the cheerleaders would go to cheer camp, which is a camp that specializes in helping cheerleaders improve their skills. Not only did @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS1 go but others schools as well so it was a huge camp all of the girls stayed in dorms at @ORGANIZATION1.  After a long day of practicing for our up coming events, everyone in our squad took showers, which was before dinner time. While my roommate was in the shower, I went and hung out in one of my other squad mates dorm room so I wouldn't be bored and just to talk before I went to take a shower.  Time had passed, my roommate @PERSON1 had gotten out of the shower. She knocked on the door to the room which I was in, I got up to answer the door and there was @PERSON1 in nothing, but a towel with a look of being alarmed. I began to panic not even knowing why she hadn't got dressed yet, before I could say anything @PERSON1 began yelling at me, "" @CAPS2, I cant believe you are that dumb!"" and I am thinking to myself, ""@CAPS3 this girl lost it or @CAPS8?"" I started clinching my hands up into fists ready to pound her. But as soon as she saw my fists get in tight balls I could see her gasp. I then began to yell at her, she quickly backed up and said very fast, "" @CAPS4, @CAPS4, @CAPS4, @CAPS2 it was only a joke."" I let my fists loosen up and said, ""@CAPS8 do you mean?"" she quickly replied with, "" I was only playing a joke, @CAPS2 I was going to say that you left the door open, but I saw that look in your eye, and decided it was time to let you know that I was just messing around and that it was only a joke. I was only practicing for my acting."" I felt a lot better because I thought I was going to do something that wouldn't have been good.  I looked up, and saw that all the other girls from the different squads that were on our floor were out in the hallway watching @CAPS8 was going on. One of them said, ""she had told us ahead of time that she was going to play a trick on you."" @CAPS10 all started laughing, I began to laugh too because it was really funny, all that was planned out and I still didn't think that it was a joke and that she really was serious.",32.0,5.0
8," There are quite a few times when laughter has made a bad situation better. The most important time I can remember was when I was a freshman in high school. I was always in the middle of drama, I don't know why, but I was. I was sent to the principals office more times than I can remember for the same reason. I had a friend named @PERSON2 and she always brought out the worst in me. Whenever we would walk by this girl named @CAPS1, she would yell mean things to us. One day @PERSON2 decided to say something back, and before I knew it I was caught in the middle.   I was trying my best to defend @PERSON2, but they were getting so close to each others faces, and I could no longer step between them. I was so afraid that they were going to fight and I was going to accidentally get caught in it. So I had one of my other friends get a teacher, and right before @PERSON1 pulled her fist back, a teacher sent us all to the office. We sat and talked to the principal for two periods, when he released us he made a rule that we were no longer aloud to talk to each other. So we all headed off to out classes, but the worst part was I had my next class with @PERSON1. We both went in the locker room completely silent and dressed down for @ORGANIZATION1. As the whole class walked into the gym I realized @PERSON1 and I had the same friends. So when we had to pick teams we were both on the same team. At fist it was extremely awkward, but after a while the game of soccer got interesting. Eventually @PERSON1 and I started to communicate about where we should stand and how embarrassing it would be to trip and @DATE1. Soon we were joking around and laughing like nothing happened, and all the stress I had disappeared.  @CAPS1 and I were laughing so much that we were practically rolling on the floor for over half the game. When the game ended We strolled on into the girls locker room like we've been best friends for years. The only thing that still weighed on my mind was how I was going to get @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 to be friends again. So when the bell rang I met @PERSON2 at my locker and we walked over to @PERSON1. Just t break the ice between them, I brought up something funny that happened in @ORGANIZATION1 and we all started laughing. Even though @PERSON2 wasn't there, @PERSON1 and I explained everything to her. Sooner than I thought we were all friends again. When I went home that day I felt so much better than I did any day that week. Laughing is something that I cant live without, it saved my friendship. ",36.0,6.0
8," It's a normal @DATE1 @TIME1 in @LOCATION1. Yes, of course it's raining and dreary outside. While most would believe it is the alarm clock blaring @NUM1 inches away from his ear, it was probably the sound of raining pelting his window like someone was spraying a fire hose right on the corner of the house he occupies, that woke him up that @TIME1. As any @DATE1 @TIME1 starts, he wakes up late and doesn't want to emerge from his bed. But he hear's the question he hear's every @TIME1, ""are you up yet?!"" asks his mom from the other side of the door, he quickly leaps from his be to the gorund and says ""yes"" in the fastest way possible. He rushes to the bathroom to get ready for what must be just another boring @DATE1. He finishes up and goes to his room, gets everything together and is about to leave, when he sees it. A small folded up piece of paper, nothing uncommon to find in his room, but this particular piece was a monologue he was suppose to perform for his second period. His second period is an acting two class, he likes the people, and the class. but there are two small problems with this class, one being that he never took acting one. The other being that he is uncomfortableperforming in front of groups of people. he quickly grabs the sheet and heads off to first period. He sits through class just waiting. He sees the students who volunteer for the front office come into his math class, as they do almost every class. He wishes the sheet was for him so he could leave his class, as he wishes everyday. Then the teacher looks over and he realizes that he doesnt actually want that note to be his, but of course it is. As it is being handed to him he thinks of every thing he has done wrong in the last few weeks trying to figure out what he did wrong. He doesnt have a clue for the rest of the period, he just waits for that bell, so he can go see what dumb thing he did has sealed his fate this rainy @TIME1.  As he waits for someone to come get him to discuss the sheet, his second period starts. Still worrying about the monologue he asks to postpone the sheet that called him to the office for just one more period. He rushes to class, being @NUM2 minutes late, to find out some depressing news. The teacher isnt there. Instead of performing his monologue he does thatre games. While he is nervous for the monologue he wants to get it over with so he can get better. Class rolls on as it always does, even without a teacher. I guess the students are really just that good. After half an hour, the teacher shows up from his doctor appointment. Monologues still go today, but theyre going to be in the audatorium, instead of in class. There is ten minutes to prepare. He goes to the hallway to practice before he has to perform. He repeats the monologue over and over, well at least the hard parts. Then of course a girl from class asks him to do it for her. She is extremely pretty, and of course way out of his league. He trys to shoo her away, but she is persistant. He finally does it for her, she gives him her honest opinion, which while helpful is sort of a deterrent. They end up just talking and conversing about things as from acting as possible. Ten minutes feels like an eternity. Then its time. He is not the first to preform. He watches the first two girls go and they both sing beautifully and act very confident. He realizes he is screwed. There is one person before him left. He memorizes the hard parts of the monologue. The last one to go preform before him is probably one of the hardest working people at being an actor that hes ever met. This guy has been in an acting class ever semester of every year. He trys hard, but sometimes he comes up a little short, but he trys. hs quickly ends, with the teacher wanting to work on him with is. Now its the final presenter with his monologue he will nervously preform. The piece is one of his favoorite comedians strand up jokes he does about how shakespeare sucks, which he believes is perffect for an acting class. He preforms it with a few mistakes, but nobody notices, until someone in the front row just starts busting out laughing at his jokes. He then realizes he can shoot out these jokes in a way mirroring the actual comedian's version of telling it. He gets a few critiques, but none that he cant fix before next time. After class a few people say he needs to try out for the play because of his performance, which he easily agrees to. Just another challenge for another day.",39.0,6.0
8," @CAPS1 one laugh @CAPS1 one laugh is all my mom asked from me and my dad, yes laughing is a simple thing that everyone in the world does and everyone enjoys but for me and my dad laughing together will rarely happen and @CAPS2 it did happen it would be ""@CAPS3 milagro"" as my mom says.  This all changed when my mom decided to go to @LOCATION1 with my little brother to go see my grandpa because he was very ill and leave me and my dad to have some daughter/father bonding time.My mom was ecstatic about this idea because she thought that me and my dad would get along better, and maybe @CAPS1 maybe get that true laugh that came from our hearts that my mom wants.   I could see the happiness that was beaming on my beautiful mom's face, her face was bright and her black beading eyes @CAPS1 starring down @CAPS7 me and all i could think of saying was ""@CAPS4 mom. don't worry we'll be fine."" I wanted to make this all work out and show my mom that me and my dad could have a perfect relationship, but this was harder than i thought. We fought all the time and argued for any little thing and we were @CAPS1 two bombs ticking ready to @CAPS1 explode.  I would lie on my bed looking up @CAPS7 my cracked up white ceiling thinking of ways to apologize to my dad so everything would be @CAPS1 fine. I've always wanted one of those miraculous endings in those sad movies when the daughter was a rebel and the father was the nice guy and @CAPS7 the end of every and each of those movies they would become one more step closer and the father would give the daughter a hug that made her feel secure and that no one was going to hurt her. I think all along that's what i wanted, to receive that long hug from my dad to make me feel loved by him. Weeks passed and my mom wasn't coming back for another two weeks so i thought to myself, @CAPS2 my dad is not going to make the first move then i am! and that's exactly how it happened. I complimented my dad everyday and i know, it probably sounds silly but it worked for me.He didn't laugh but he did smile, his smile gave me satisfaction, it made me feel victorious when i saw that smile of his wrinkled up face and something told me that those smiles he flashed @CAPS7 me were coming from his heart. This all changed when we hit @DATE1, in @LOCATION2 it is said that once @CAPS5 hit a new year @CAPS5 get a new life and when @CAPS5 get that new life @CAPS5 receive a special gift. The gift of love.I personally didn't believe that, i thought how can @CAPS5 get a new life @CAPS2 @CAPS5 already made up your own?  But yes, i have to say this is true and i learned this with my dad. It was the a few days after new years everything was calm between us and we @CAPS1 talked about the basic things a daughter and a father could talk about school and what did I'd want to eat.Until one afternoon we were walking outside and it was pretty cold every time time i breathed out a slow and steady breath i felt that my breath would @CAPS1 freeze and fall into a million pieces. We walked started to walk towards my house and the unexpected happened, my dad said the words that I've been wanting to hear for over years""@CAPS5 know what, @CAPS5 mean the world to me and @CAPS5 will forever be my little princess @CAPS8 @CAPS2 @CAPS5 get old!""@CAPS7 that precise moment i didn't know either to cry or hug him, it was some what shocking for me.Could the thing that i was longing for for happen @CAPS7 this moment? and yes it did. I gave my dad a hug that felt that lasted for over an hour but actually, it was only one minute. But that minute was an eternity for me, i felt that safe with him i was a warmness in my heart and i knew we could over come anyone and anything. That was an amazing moment for me and him too, but then the after was the worse.That security and peace that i felt @CAPS7 the beginning was all crushed, my heart was crushed when my dad told me my grandpa passed away. @CAPS7 that moment i wanted to throw up how could somethings so beautiful @CAPS1 happen and be ruined into this horrendous news.I did learn a lesson, laughter is the shortest distance between people. Now i laugh with my dad most of the time and i always laughed with my beloved grandfather,@CAPS8 @CAPS2 my grandfather was away over the phone we would laugh @CAPS7 all of our memories.

8," Laughter is the sure way into anyone's heart at any time. Think about it laughter can be used in many situations in life when someone is sad,mad,depressed, or even if someones happy you can make them happier by making that person laugh and make they're day which in a way could make someone else's day a good one and so on and so on in a pay it forward kind of way. I remember once my @CAPS1 @PERSON1 who is used to trying to run the @CAPS4 where ever she goes and who tries to see the good in things in her hectic life with a fast paced business. In this business she deals with people who have different and sometimes multiple needs that must be dealt with in order to run her business so all she can do is smile in times of desperation and that's just what she could do and what she did this one time in @LOCATION1 during a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 me and my @CAPS1, @CAPS6,@CAPS1's friend, all worked for her and we entered @LOCATION1 on a @DATE1 @TIME1 and when We got to the hotel we couldn't believe how weird it was it had paintings every where on every possible space were paintings could fit and where no more paintings fit there were mirrors even in the rooms and doors, the place was called the @CAPS8. We were all very exhausted from the drive over especially with all the luggage we had in the car what none of us knew was that my @CAPS1 had nine bags and two purses with her for three days of work while the rest of us had only one bag the size of one of her purse's and my @CAPS6,mom, and friend were all carrying one of her bags on our laps the whole car ride in a little @CAPS9 @CAPS10 so we got to @LOCATION1 and we unloaded all her bags(well actually I did)and laid all the bags up on a third story floor room and for the weirdest reason the room smelled wet. And sure enough the carpets were wet and i had to lug around ll her and my families stuff up two more floors. By the time we got everything settled we were already late for work so after looking for half an hour we get there and get in. but then we got kicked out because they did not register us yet an dthey thought we snuck in. So we finally got back in and then we relized we still had to sell and work all day. after work we went to the hotel they all (excluding me) went out for the night and came back and we discovered that my @CAPS1 had brought @NUM1 pairs of shoes and that's what three bags were full of. after all the struggles we finally left @LOCATION1 and headed home. All we could do is laugh till our car broke down with @NUM2 bags in it with five of those on our laps and he rest in the trunk.When we got help it turned out my @CAPS1 left her phone at the hotel so we had to drive @NUM3 miles back to @LOCATION1 and then wait to get the car repaired then finally my @CAPS1 bought my @CAPS6 and mom and me a plane ticket so we flew back exhausted yet ready to joke and laugh and die.

8," About @NUM1 years ago, my older brother and I had the house to ourselves for the weekend. Our parents had gone to @LOCATION1 for a wedding for one of my father's cousins. For my brother and I, parents being gone for the weekend, never meant wild parties with girls, friends, and loud music. But we still @CAPS7 some crazy things close to that, that we weren't normally allowed to do. We played guitar and drums past our curfew, had multiple friends over and stay the @TIME1 for video games and hanging out, and doing reckless activities outside. Like shooting our neighbors house with a sling shot, using eggs or paint-balls, or firing golf balls out of the backyard. In this case, we wanted to see how far we could hit golf balls out of the back yard using drivers. It was a warm @DATE1 day, and I could see that our neighbors front door, directly ahead of us, was wide open, probably to keep it cooler inside. I started, by smacking the first golf ball into a tree nearby, not making much distance for my brother to top. My brother isn't a small guy either. @CAPS6 is a muscle bound high school student, and if you give him a club, @CAPS6 could send a golf ball @NUM2 yards with ease, like @CAPS6 does at the driving range in @LOCATION2 when my father brings us there for fun. @CAPS6 set up his tee and put the golf ball in place. @CAPS6 stepped back, turned to me, and quoted a line from @ORGANIZATION1- ""@CAPS1 long, sucker."" @CAPS2 @CAPS6 stepped up, swung fast, and as the club made contact with the club, there was a sound like the snap of a bone, and the ball was gone. We watched as the white ball flew through the air, a little more than @NUM3 yards into the road, and bounce off the top of a moving car, and into our neighbors front door. The car could be heard swerving to a stop, as we ducked down and quickly went into our house. Through the open window, we heard our neighbor yelling from his front door, and cursing angrily. My brother and I began @CAPS8 at the amazing shot, and how crazy the chance of it happening was. About ten minutes later, my brother and I had settled down, and we heard a knock at the door. I answered it with him behind me. It was our neighbor. @CAPS6 was holding up the golf ball in one hand with the other hand raised and open, shouting ""@CAPS3, nay?!"" ""@CAPS4?"" I replied. ""@CAPS3, nay?!"" @CAPS6 shouted again, making my brother and I laugh at his language. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS10 hit this ball into me house?! @CAPS10 done broke my glass show case with all the rocks I've collected over the years! @CAPS3, nay? Yes or no?!' @CAPS8 really hard now, my brother finally took control, and calmed down, and said, ""I'm sorry @PERSON1, I wasn't intending on hitting the ball in that direction. I was trying to aim into the forest."" @CAPS9 down, the neighbor handed over the ball, and said ""@CAPS10 hit me house again, you can be sure, that you'll be paying for my show case you rotten kids."" @CAPS6 turned around and walked off back to his house, very angry, and my brother and I continued @CAPS8 about the how funny his voice and language sounded, and turned on the @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 to @CAPS12 a video game.",42.0,7.0

After many failed suggestions we all agreed to go to @LOCATION1 and go boating! @CAPS9 @CAPS3 been a pretty cold morning so we bundled up in our warmest clothes, knowing @CAPS9 would be colder at the @LOCATION1. @CAPS4, my little sister, wore a blue winter hat and pink mittens. I put on my favorite green beanie and my warm fleece jacket. While us girls were getting ready my dad loaded the fishing poles and tackle box into the car. Then my mom, @CAPS4 and I packed our favorite snacks and made @CAPS5&@CAPS6's for lunch!  Once everything was ready and loaded we headed off to the @LOCATION1! The drive there was a blast, singing along to our favorite @NUM1's tunes and admiring the scenary. When we arrived at the @LOCATION1 we rented a boat for the day. This boat was like none I'd ever seen, I think calling @CAPS9 a tin can would be more fitting! Nothing about @CAPS9 looked safe, but I hesitantly stepped into @CAPS9, losing my balance as @CAPS9 rocked back and forth. With us all squished in this little boat my dad started up the motor and we started out on the @LOCATION1. @CAPS9 was overcast and windy like we @CAPS3 expected.

My dad got up and scrambled to @CAPS7 the flopping @CAPS2. To our suprise @CAPS9 was nothing but a three inch little trout! At the sight of @CAPS9 we all busted up laughing. We laughed the entire way back to the docks, so much that @CAPS4 and I @CAPS3 tear running down our faces. Still to this day when I think of my dad flying backwards for that tiny @CAPS2 I crack up.

8," Like many @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 students I have always viewed test taking is a rather stressful time. The @TIME2 study sessions and the fact that many tests can make or break your grade in a class are likely, inevitable, reasons for stress. While most students stress and study then stress and study some more I've found a very effective way to rid myself of the inconvenience of stress, which is simply put to laugh.  All students enrolled in @CAPS1-calculus at @ORGANIZATION1 must learn and be able to recite about @NUM1 trigonomic identities, and I am no exception. Due to a rather poor grade point average last semester I know that @TIME1 semester I need to do exceptionally well in @ORGANIZATION1 if I want to hold a job outside of pumping gas. So like many @CAPS1-@CAPS2 students I stayed up long past when the sun fell writing and trying to commit @CAPS3 identities into my memory for the test today. Needless to say I was a little stressed. As time passed by @TIME1 my anxiety level was exponentially increasing. Then the time had come, the test was in my hands. I felt somewhat confident that I knew what the reciprocal of co-secant was so I lowered my pencil to the paper. Only to be interrupted. A wave of relief consumed my body as I realized my named was called to be excused from class, meaning I was granted more time to study. Unfortunately I the note read ""please send student immediately to @NUM2 for state testing. Thank @CAPS4"". Now I was worried about @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and state testing. On the walk to the testing room I could not rid myself of thoughts about failing both my tests and not being able to the come up with money to repair my car that I almost totaled last @DATE1 and the wall that I damaged as well. I opened the door to @NUM2, and needless to say I was more than a little stressed. Then I read one of the worst test prompt's I have ever seen. Making a claim about how ""We all Understand..."". That's a pretty bold claim, saying that everyone understands something. I would go as far as to say it's just wrong, we all don't understand the benefits laughter. I have no clue what all the physical benefits of laughter are and I doubt @CAPS4 do either. Sitting in my chair I couldn't help but start to grin. Then it got even better. The prompt then quoted ""someone"". A state issued test derived a prompt off of a quote from ""someone"" then preceded to ask students to tell a true story. Then I laughed harder then I had laughed in a long time. I laughed until the thoughts of owning people thousands of dollars and working at a gas station all my life because I failed at @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 stopped haunting me. Then I proceeded to write one of the dumbest essays I have ever wrote on one of the dumbest prompts I have ever seen.",38.0,6.0
8," Exactly what is laughter? Why do people laugh? As a sixteen year old girl I laugh a whole bunch but, why do I laugh I have always wondered why? Laughter is the most universal emotion. Babies laugh, elderly people laugh, and @CAPS4 do teens. People laugh when they are told funny jokes or stories. Laughter is shown even when you get hurt or when you witness somebody else getting hurt. I believe laughter is a huge element in our lives. @CAPS4 don't be uptight and have a laugh once in awhile, its good for you.  My mother went tumbling down. @CAPS2 all happened when my family went camping with a couple of friends. We had this beautiful campsite over looking a waterfall, plants and flowers surrounding us. There was only one default which was, the hill we had to climb to get to the water. The second day of our comping adventure was going great, until my mother came back with the water jug not paying attention she tries to run down the hill while talking. Everything went down hill from that literally. My mother tripped on a rock about the size of a babies fist, falling down on her knees while throwing the water jug up in the air. Sliding her whole body down the hill head first. The whole campsite starts laughing, everyone witnessed my mother falling on her face going down the hill. I never understood why people laughed when others get hurt. Maybe its because they know they aren't the ones getting hurt but, either way we laugh.  Don't you hate hitting your elbow? That's the worst, the pain just never stops, and @CAPS2 tingles your elbow down to your hand. No matter how hard you hit your elbow or you @MONTH1 call @CAPS2 your funny bone, you laugh don't you. I do, every time. Its a weird feeling but at the same time @CAPS2 hurts. I remember once, I was sitting in math class not really pay attention @CAPS4 I fount a magnet and @CAPS2 was really strong I clinched @CAPS2 to the table I was sitting at and I went to go pull @CAPS2 off. That's when @CAPS2 was stuck. I tried just sliding @CAPS2 down to loose some of the magnet but nothing worked. @CAPS4 that's when I had to take drastic measures, I grabbed the magnet with both hands and pulled. Have you ever done something and in the middle of doing @CAPS4, you just knew @CAPS2 was a bad idea? Well that happened to me, when I starting pulling on the magnet a light bulb hit me. I was going to regret this and of coarse I did, the magnet lost charge and my elbow went flying hitting my metal chair. I could feel the pulse in my elbow, @CAPS2 was a horrible pain in my arm. I started laughing but, this laugh wasn't like a ""ha-ha"" kinda of laugh @CAPS2 was like a laughing crying type. To think back I think I might have cried. @CAPS2 wasn't serious but I saw a tear. The class starting to notice what I have done. First my teacher told me I should have been paying attention to the lesson and not a magnet and this wouldn't have happened. I believe everything happens for a reason @CAPS4, I believe I had this terrible occurrence @CAPS4 I can write about @CAPS2 today. @CAPS2 was worth the pain and tear. At least I got a laugh out of @CAPS2. Watching television, I see a lot of commercials. My favorite commercial is the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 commercial @CAPS2 make me laugh. The whole point of the commercial is having the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 mature, well in the beginning of the commercial obviously the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 isn't mature yet and @CAPS2 tells a joke, first off a talking @CAPS1 @CAPS2, whats funnier than that? But okay the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 tells the joke, ""why did the chef get arrested?"" why, ""because he was caught beating an egg."" ""ha-ha"" get @CAPS2. Jokes always make me laugh, no matter the time, place, or even, the situation. My favorite joke has to be a knock knock joke, because their always different also, you can just make one up on the spot for example, ""knock knock."" @CAPS3 there? ""@PERSON1"" @PERSON1 who? ""@PERSON1 (I ring) the door bell but you didn't answer that's why I knocked"". Tell your friends, kids, or even your grandparents brothers, a joke today I bet you and the person you tell them to will laugh. Jokes make everyone's day better.  @CAPS2 was once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 get close, Tell a joke, get hurt, push someone down a small hill, or even hit your elbow. I bet you will get a laugh out of @CAPS2. @CAPS4 after reading this do you also believe laughter is a big element of live? I for sure do. ",43.0,7.0
8," Without laughter, life would be pointless. Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you'll see see my point soon enough. Without laughter, there would not be sayings such as ""@CAPS1. @CAPS2. Love."", ""@CAPS2 @CAPS4 off."", or ""Laughter is the best medicine."" @CAPS3 would be the point of living if you could not hear a newborn baby's giggle? a toddler crack up? or even a chuckle from a friend, during a light-hearted conversation, after a big fight? How could we be who we are without humor, or most importantly, laughter? Laughter is a big part of my life. My family and I are very close and I think part of that closeness began with laughter. @CAPS4 can help a situation to not be tense, or brighten a day. In my mind, @CAPS4 is like this magic tool that turns any frown, upside-down. Think about @CAPS4, laughter is contagious. There are very few days that go by in my life where I do not @CAPS2; more commonly referred to as my 'bad days.' @CAPS4 is quite obvious when you realize you have had one of these days, because when you @CAPS2, things feel almost instantly better. Thinking back on @CAPS4, I can recall a few instances where a good @CAPS2 helped at a bad time. There are so many though, @CAPS4's hard to think of just one specific time, because laughter is around me all the time. My parents and I often make jokes. We like to play around , and dress-up, and make-fun of shows on @CAPS5.V. (for kicks and giggles). When we @CAPS2, we start to create these bonding moments which bring us so much closer together. If we didn'@CAPS5 @CAPS2, we would not bond. Every situation would be so tense and serious, every conversation- boring and lifeless. Laughing brings out the fun in life, and relationships need fun. I mean, come on... when have you not giggled, or even cracked a smile, when you were having a bad day and you saw someone's face, and heard them as they were just dying laughing over nothing, or even fell out of their chair? Tell me I'm not right; try going a day without laughing, I dare you. See, this is why I believe laughter is an important element to any relationship- because of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 does to people! @CAPS4 can lighten moods, help bring people closer, brighten any day, or even brighten a life. Some of the friendliest and most happy people you will meet in life are the ones who love to @CAPS2. Are you one of these people?",38.0,6.0
8,"Having a positive attitude will most likely make laughter in your life. It helps make you think happier and to just laugh a little bit more. When in a relationship laughter is a big thing, @NUM1 people need to be happy. But laughter isnt everything in a relationship there is respect, responsibility, and commitment. With a better attitude on things it helps the hard things get done faster and with a smile on your face.  When laughter is the only thing holding the relationship up it isnt a good thing in fact it isnt healthier for the @NUM1 of you. One thing it does do is keeps the relationship interesting. Personally i love to have a interesting relationship isnt laughter pretty much how people meet? Like in bars, hotel, store, or anywhere. For me every relationship that i have started started with a joke or a laugh. When you laugh in a relationship it kind of makes you want to do more for the other person and respect them more. when laughter is help up with other speacil qualitys then the relationship will grow into something amazing.  When ever i am sad or not feeling so hot i will go talk to one of my best friends about school or wrestling and laugh about some things. My day normally goes smoother and better when i laugh. When i am laughing at something that is funny or that entertains me then my mind is set off the terrible things that are happening in my life. It helps me think clearer aboutwhat i want todo next in my day if i want to make the next few seconds bad decisions or if i want to make them good. Makeing the taugh things fun helps time and your life go by a little faster and more fun. I will use an example, i have to mow the lawn but i want to play video games but know i need to get my lawn mowed. How do i aproach this? i go outside and say to myself ""just get it done"". Or not do it and get in trouble. I would rather just get it done then fix my mood by playing video games. If you are informed one of your realitives died or get injured and you dont know what to do i recamend get some help because laughing doesnt always fix things but normally it does. ",38.0,6.0
8,"Last @DATE1 was one to remember, but one memory in particular stands out from all the rest. The sun was beginning to set over the distant mountains as me and my family piled into the large tan suburban my step dad had purchased the weak before. It was a nice car and as I got in I was careful not to drag my muddy shoos along the new carpet. The car was not completely new but the man who had owned it before kept it in tip top shape.  We where on our way to my ants house for dinner and a movie. @CAPS5 was suppose to be introducing my parents to a good friend of hers from collage. @CAPS5 was staying with her for a few days while her house was getting remodeled. I decided to bring a book to read just in case i got bored. Listening to grownups talk can get purity boring and i was not going to just sit around doing nothing. We pulled into the drive way and got out of the car. As we walked into the house we could smell my ants lasagna and her famous bread sticks in the oven. @CAPS5 always made lasagna when @CAPS5 wanted to show off. I walked in the house and went start for my favorite corner but someone was already sitting there. I stopped and looked at her. @CAPS5 was short with long blond hair and small square glasses. At first I didn't know what to think of her but I did know that I didn't like her sitting in my spot. I walked up slowly as @CAPS5 looked up from her book. Hello. ""@CAPS1,""@CAPS5 said. And looked back down at her book.  ""@CAPS2... @CAPS3 in my spot,""I said. @CAPS5 put her book down and looked at me. ""@CAPS3 names not on it,"" @CAPS5 said. ""@CAPS4,"" I said, ""the blanket @CAPS3 sitting on does have my name on it.""  @CAPS5 got to her knees and examined the blanket. Across the four large yellow squares was my name in blow letters. @CAPS5 got to her feet  ""@CAPS6 it looks like this really is @CAPS3 spot,"" @CAPS5 said. ""That's @CAPS7 ,"" I said. I like to sit here because its quiet and i can reed. If you scoot over i can sit beside you.  ""I think I can manage that,"" @CAPS5 said. @CAPS5 moved over and i sat down.We opened our books and began reading. It was quiet for a long time but all of the sudden my brothers came in and started playing around and making all kinds of noise. At first we just ignore it but after a wile it was becoming to much to handle. @CAPS5 put her book down and looked at me. ""@CAPS8 they allays like this,"" @CAPS5 said? Ya... it gets old after a wile. ""@CAPS9 you have any brothers or sisters,""I asked? @CAPS5 hesitated for a wile. ""@CAPS10,"" @CAPS5 said. I am a only child.  ""That's to bad,"" I said. We began reading again but the noise was just to much to stand. I put my book down and was just about to tell them to leave when my little brother ran across the floor and tripped. We both putt our books down and said,""that will teach you"",@CAPS11 we looked at each other and started to laugh.  @CAPS5 said,""oh by the way, i didn't catch @CAPS3 name"".  Oh I'm @ORGANIZATION1. Whats @CAPS3 name? ""@CAPS12,"" @CAPS5 said. @CAPS6 its nice to meat you @CAPS12. @CAPS8 you hungry? I think dinner is ready. after that we wher best friends",35.0,6.0
8," Through this great, long @DATE2, working as a crew girl, I met a ton of new people and built many new friendships that created many new memories, and all of those memories, even though they came from cleaning bathrooms and washing dishes, make us happy and make us laugh. My favorite memory involves @PERSON2, also known as @ORGANIZATION1, a short, blond, intelligent @NUM1 year old girl who loved to read, write, and singing songs, often changing them to fit with our daily lifes. Christy, refereed to as @CAPS1 @CAPS2, is extremely tall with short brown hair. She is a @NUM2 year old who is outgoing and lots of fun, even though she was the leader to the crew girls. Another important person to this story is @PERSON3, @PERSON3 was the ""@CAPS3"" at camp for high school week. He is a short old man who was very awkward sitting around a table eating dinner with @NUM3 other girls. The last main @CAPS4 is me, @PERSON1, know at camp as @CAPS5. I'm a little shorter than average, with long brow hair. I'm very talkative and outgoing, I love to read and spend time with my family and friends.  At the beginning of each week the crew girls were all given a job. This particular week @ORGANIZATION1 and I were given the task of going and helping out at the high school camp. We, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and I loved working at the high school camp it was so much fun. We were having a great time, spending hours singing songs while washing dishes, all by hand, having water fights around the house, riding in the back of the trailer from camp to camp, and other random jobs we were told to do. Such as washing cars to going on @CAPS8 runs. All in all this week was building great new memories with lots of fun and laughter.  Everything twisted about half way through the week. @DATE1 was not going as well as we expected. First off we were running late which crammed us for time the rest of the day. We all were stressed running around like chickens with our heads cut off, which is even harder to deal with, people running everywhere bumping into each other getting upset. Just crazy all around. Everyone needed to calm down or people could start getting in the way and getting hurt on accident. Another problem, or the first accident, was that @PERSON3 was stepping over the hitch and ripped his pants. This means we now need to go to his house and get him new pants before we drop off the food, which delayed us even more. @ORGANIZATION1 and I jump in the back of the trailer to make sure nothing goes wrong back there with the food. As we go up the hill we notice that the heater, which weighs about @NUM4 pounds, is loose and not hooked up like it is suppose to be. @ORGANIZATION1 and I have no idea what to do. Many thoughts went through our minds, what do we do about the food, how are we going to keep ourselves safe, should we jump out of the trailer, we were clueless on what to do. There was no way we could have contacted @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or @PERSON3, and it would be about seven minutes until we stopped.  @PERSON3 decided to let us out at the high school camp before he went home to change his pants because he realized we were still crammed for time and neeed to drop off the food as soon as possible. As we unloaded the food @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was upset with us, she though she could trust us, she wondered why were we messing around with the heater, and told us we were lucky that almost all of the food was still edible. Finally when we got it all set out and got to sit down ourselves we told @CAPS1 @CAPS2 what happens and how we didn't undo the heater. She was super apologetic and was glad we were still here and figured out a way to keep us and the food safe. After this we were just living in the moment, and cherishing every second we had together. Laughing about all the good times we had this week and previous weeks. How glad we all were that we met and got to know each other. The last thought of the day was how happy we all were that these things happened to us because with them we grow closer and encounter more and more memories that we get to laugh about together forever.",39.0,6.0
8," Every spring break my brothers and I, go spend time with my uncle @CAPS1. He lives in @LOCATION1 it is a beautiful place to go. While we are there we usually go fishing, we catch sea bass, perch, cant remember the other names of the fish but the perch hit the pole pretty hard, its a thriller. There is a funny way we make our weights, we get a extra piece of fishing line and duck tape, then we tie a loop into the extra piece of line, then we hook it to the swivel and tape the rock to the line, one of the best weights to use. My uncle, also my brother we like to get out and fish a spot that we believe is our secret spot we can sit out there all day and catch giant fish. Whenever we catch a bundle of fish we go over to my uncle's friends house,his name is @PERSON1. He knows how to fillet fish very well so we go to him. Whenever he fillets our fish we usually let him keep some of the fish for himself, and for doing the job for us. I am glad he a good friend, @PERSON1 said he was going to take us out on his fishing boat witch goes out a few miles into the @ORGANIZATION1. We ended up going with him and we caught a lean cod that was two and a half feet long it, faught for at least thirty minutes, it was a great experience. Now whenever my brothers and i go to visit my uncle we ask if we can go out on the fishing boat, to fish for crab and all sorts of fish. Our secret spot, it is about a mile long walk, but oh it is worth the adventure. It is through the woods then you got to walk under some pretty rough brush, along with sticks, poky bush's but once you get to the view it is amazing. Then we set all of our fishing stuff up onto the upper part of the rock that we are on, we have our bucket of sand shrimp right next to us, because the current of the wave's rip them off some of the times. The sand shrimp are one of the best baits to use other than herring, the sand shrimp doesn't take the fish to long to get the sent of it. The sea bass that we catch they're very unique they have a spectacular amount of colors that the come in.  The sea bass usually get around a foot foot an a half up close by the reef's but once you get out further into the @ORGANIZATION1 the sea bass get up to about three feet some people have told me. I think it would be fun to go out on the boat and go and try to catch a shark. I believe that would be a fun and exciting story to tell to people, and my family and I could go and show them were the shark was caught. That is all I got to say about my fishing story's.",37.0,6.0
8," It was around @NUM1 on the @TIME1 of @DATE1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 had just arrived at the airport from @LOCATION1 , he was going to be staying a whole month with us. @CAPS1 house is located roughly @NUM2 yards away from the sand dunes and we have a shop full of four wheelers, dirtbikes, and side by sides so it was going to be fun. We immediatly started laughing as soon as he got to our house, right away it was nothing but jokes and old stories and just stuff that is not funny but makes you laugh, laughing is a major part of @CAPS1 family its like a tradition, yes I know you here laughing as a tradition and you think that's not a tradition,a tradition is something your family and or friends do on the same date every year, well for us its that way.  The first day that we all went out to go riding we were pulling pranks hiding people's riding gear, and or drinks and just having fun, when we got on the sand the war started and by war I mean (roosting) which is im sure slang for using a four wheeler to throw sand on someone, but anyways thats what we started doing. It was so much fun and you would roost someone and they would get a little upset but then they would start to laugh and join in on the fun. Some people were on four strokes others on two strokes so after awhile the ones who were on the two strokes had to go back to fuel up and get something to drink, and or eat. Well while those people went back to do that @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS1 step brother, and I decided to go play and the whole time we werte roosting each other playing cat and mouse, and just laughing. But the funniest part of that day was when @CAPS1 @CAPS2 thought he would come up a different side of the hill to cut us off and roost us well @CAPS1 brother and I knew where the sand was soft and where it was not, what happened will probably remind you of when, in cartoons something goes thru a wall and you can only see the outline of the person or object, well this was identical he tried to come up the hill and as he did the whole four wheeler and him went about six feet into the hill. @CAPS1 brother and I started laughing so hard that we fell off our four wheelers and they kept going so we had to chase them. After @CAPS1 @CAPS2 pulled the bike out and got back on he went slow the whole way back to the house. The next day we went out to a different part of the dunes, and this time we were kind of playing hide and seek tag (roost) and we were in a dirt/sand area and we were going really fast jumping through bushes over water on the four wheelers, well we got to a dead end and i spun around before @CAPS1 little brother got behind me then he tried, well that didn't work as well as he had intended on, the bike almost flipped but he managed to jump off and the bike landed back on it's wheels, now four wheelers are known to bog down and die when someone is not giving it any gas, well his did not it kept going so when i turned around to see what was going on all i seen was him being @NUM3 foot @NUM4 inches chasing after a big blue four wheeler. When we got back I had to tell everyone, ad of course he was no where to be found, after i got done everyone was silent like are you serious, then all of the sudden there was an up roar of laughter, food got spit out, soda came out people's noses, it was very amusing. I do not know @CAPS4 you can tell how important laughing is to @CAPS1 family and I but its a part of us laughing in @CAPS1 family is like a kid in a candy store, tey want what ever they can have well with us its kind of like that we want to laugh at whatever we possibly can, the way I look at it @CAPS4 you do not have a sense of humor and can laugh about stuff what do you have? really. A nice car, a big house with a pool, none of that matters @CAPS4 you cannot laugh and have fun no one will want to be around you, and when they are they will feel awfully akward. Laughing is not only good for you but its also quite the work out. I guess laughing can burn like @NUM3 calories depending on how hard you laugh and how long. I remeber cartoons about people loosing there laugh box, @CAPS4 that were ossible no one in @CAPS1 family would have one.  So laugh every once in awhile.",34.0,6.0
8,"  I've always heard the saying ""laughter is the best medicine"". Ive heard it from many different people in my life. And I believe it's true. The thing that I want most when I'm sad, down, or hurting is to have someone make me laugh and smile. I believe that laughter is the key to happiness and happiness is the key to all relationships. Without laughter, this world would be boring and lifeless.    Whether its a relationship between you and your friends and family, or with the one you hope to get married to someday, happiness should should be a part of it. And the best way to get someone happy is to make them laugh. If you couldn't make your friends laugh, then how would you be able to create such good, fun memories in your life? And what if you couldn't make your boyfriend or girlfriend laugh? You wouldn't really be able get along very well. So the most important part in a relationship is being happy with each other.  Relationships have to be full of laughter in order to work out. How are you supposed to get along with your boyfriend or girlfriend if you can't laugh and have fun together? That's why laughter is so important in relationships. Without it, some relationships wouldn't work out. Making the person you love laugh or even giggle is truly an amazing feeling. I believe that laughter is a type of bond in a relationship. After you make him or her laugh you feel a type of connection with them.    When someone's down and gloomy, the best way to brighten up there day is to do or say something funny. As soon as they laugh, a smile will be put on their face. After you make someone laugh, you're not only cheering them up, you're also giving them a better day. Instead of ignoring them and letting them stay gloomy, making them laugh will make them happier and make them believe that someone cares enough to cheer them up. They will remember you as a caring person who gave them a better day and made them laugh. You don't have to believe this, but I do. I beleive that laughter is the best medicine.  ",38.0,6.0
8," There is always that laughter somewhere either with friends, grandparents, parents, well really anyone. You could laugh with anyone that's whats so great about laughing. For one example i could even laugh with the cashier lady in the store. Just because you do not know a person we all love to laugh. That's the joy of it all.  There are so many story's that were the funniest thing when i was a little kid. Everything was funny to me back then i really had a natural laugh back then. Now i am growing up and its just gone i feel as if i have to make my self laugh. Then again there is always that one thing that i laugh so hard at, at least once a week. I love to laugh its the best thing in the world to me.                                My friends and i love laughing i think that's what we are best at. If none of us are laughing at anything we know something is wrong. So this story was actually about @TIME1. It was me @LOCATION1@NUM1,and @CAPS1. We were all at my house hanging out and i asked @CAPS1 to pluck my eye brows. She had always done a good job for the whole year. This time i knew she was a little off but i didn't think anything of it. We all sitting there i was texting as she was doing my eye brows and she stops. Shes like um your eye brow just got really short. I was not paying that much attention so i did not understand what she was talking about. I got up and i turned to everyone and they just started busting up laughing. I just sat there for a min as they laughed for like @NUM2 min straight. Finally i got up and looked in the mirror. My eye brow was about three inches long. All i could do was laugh it was a never ending thing. Then i got mad, i said that they were all jerks and they better fix it. As i was laughing i just forgot about it, then all of us started laughing at each other so it like a battle for laughing.  At this point i was sitting there texting my brother and telling him what had happen. He told me ""ha ha loser"", we do that to each other all the time. Then out of no where i remembered when i was about @NUM3 years old i shaved off my eye brows it was so bad. My brother made fun of me so much and we just laughed so hard. Which always makes me laugh, also so did my aunt she made fun of me to. I learned my lesson. I am never doing that again it was to humiliating. Good thing i was @NUM3 and not any older, after this happened my eye brow did not grow in for a long time.  All i do is laugh not so much now as before but its just not normal not to laugh. Every one has to laugh its like the joy coming out of you. My family likes to say that i always had the same laugh every since i was little. All my friends say that i sound like a little kid when i laugh. Maybe i just never grew out of my old laugh. The weird thing about laughing though to me is that i have a lot of different laughs. It all depends on what mood i am in.  Laughing is something that everyone does even a baby. Its a natural beautiful thing to life i honestly think. I got half my eye brow gone but instead of freaking out about it i laughed. That was a best friend moment so i always make sure to live my life to the fullest. I am always going to need laughter in my life. Laughing brings people together ans closer. There are so many memories with laughter in them that's what make them the memories. Everyone needs laughing in there lives.",34.0,6.0
8," Many people say that memories last a lifetime. My favorite memories are with my best friend @PERSON1. If the myth; the more you laugh the longer you live is true, @PERSON1 and I would live to be a very old with all the memories in our life that make us laugh. Having many moments in our life that make us laugh makes our relationship stronger. To begin with, we all make little mistakes in our life that embarrass us but instead of letting the mistake into my head I just laugh about it. On a very cold, icy day in the middle of @DATE1 I was walking down to @ORGANIZATION1's house for lunch. From the school to her house there is a long, steep flight of stairs that just wait for people to walk down them and @DATE2. As I was walking I took very slow and little steps so I wouldn't @DATE2 down the stairs. I grabbed onto @ORGANIZATION1's arm for more support. Whether she liked it or not I was not going to @DATE2 down alone. @PERSON1 and I took our time and ambled down the slick and icy stairs. As we reached the last part of the stairs I noticed the last flight wasn't as icy. I let go of @ORGANIZATION1's arm and the first step was the last step I took walking down the stairs. Walking down the stairs quickly was a blunder I don't know what I was thinking! When I took the first step down the stairs my arms went flying and I went down like a little kid going down a slide. When I reached the bottom of the stairs tears started rolling down my face. I wasn't crying because I was hurt but I was laughing so much I started to cry.  Next, @PERSON1 and I were standing at the bottom of the stairs with boisterous laughter filling the whole town. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's house our loud laughter turned into continuous giggles, for the rest of the day we were jovial and no one could wipe the smiles off our faces. It was time to go back to the school and when we reached the long flight of stairs I was paranoid and didn't want to walk up them and @DATE2 again. As I was walking I had a lot of support from the railing. The trip up the stairs was very difficult because I kept thinking about me falling down the stairs. In my head I could just see myself descending down the long flight of stairs.  Finally, we reached the top of the stairs alive without any accidents. My guts were aching from all the laughter. I told @ORGANIZATION1 not to tell anyone about the embarrassing @DATE2, but the next class period we couldn't stop laughing and people wanted to know what was so funny. Everyone in the class eventually found out but when people started talking about it I just kept laughing. Every time I look back at that memory it will just put a smile on my face.  The most memorable memories I have is with my best friend @PERSON1 that make us laugh. I love the days where I can be with my friends and laugh until I cry or having my stomach ache and not being able to breathe from all the guffaws. Everyone has memories that make them laugh. I love having days where I can laugh with my friends because I know it is making our friendship stronger.",37.0,6.0

The @CAPS5 @CAPS6 is like hardcore musical chairs, you get everyone to hold hands around three chairs placed in the middle of the room and the objective is to make the other players run into the chairs. If someone touches one of them, @CAPS16're out, and the last one standing wins. We had just finished our third @CAPS6 and @CAPS3 was time to go home because my youth pastor, @PERSON1, wanted to go and was locking up the church. So we said good bye to him and started walking home. We didn't live very far from the church, I lived about five blocks away and @CAPS4 lived three blocks away. @CAPS3 was still warm even though @CAPS3 was in the late fall and foggy. We were talking about guitars as we walked. We were walking slowly so that we could talk longer. @CAPS3 was time to say good bye to @CAPS4 and I would have to walk the rest of the way home. I said ""@CAPS9 ya man"". He replied"" @CAPS9 ya, have a good @CAPS2"". As @CAPS4 was saying this, a car drove by on the road parallel to the one that we were on and slowed down and looked at us for a second then turned on its blinker to turn up ahead onto the road I would be on in a minute. I said ""That's weird"" to @CAPS4 but he was already inside. So I hid under his dads truck, just in case. Just as I had gotten under the truck the car turned the corner. There @CAPS3 was, sitting at the end of the street. The only movement was the fog rolling slowly across the beam of the head lights that seemed to be scanning the street for movement, like a beast stalking its prey. The only noise I could hear was the engines menacing drone. I was frozen like a statue, afraid @CAPS3 would @CAPS9 me if I moved. @CAPS3 slowly started to move forward, seeming to be double checking everything to @CAPS9 if @CAPS9 if I was there. Then @CAPS3 came to a stop at the intersection, no stop sign, no red light, no reason to stop at all. There I lay, frozen, my heart sounded like a drum, pounding in my head. Adrenaline pumping through my veins. Minutes seemed to be hours as the car sat within reach of me, sitting at the intersection.  Then, @CAPS3 slowly left, seeming to be confused and disappointed that @CAPS3 didn't find me. I waited until I knew @CAPS3 was gone for sure. Then I raced as fast as I could the rest of the way home, never looking back. Every muscle in my body throbbing, my blood pulsing through my body, every ounce of will and strength pushed for one goal. To make @CAPS3 home. I sped down my driveway opened the door to my house and dove in. Then a calm came over me, my heart slowed down, I was relived that I was still alive. Then I calmly walked into the living room and fell on the couch. My dad said ""@CAPS13's @CAPS14 and @CAPS15?"". Confused I just sat there and stared at him. ""@CAPS16 came over to play cards and @CAPS16 decided to go pick you up"" my dad explained. That's when @CAPS3 hit me, my @CAPS17 were the people in the car.

8," Laughter, it's something we all have experienced. It's a part of our everyday lives, even if we don't laugh ourselves we still hear other people laughing. Sometimes people laugh at really stupid things. This is one of those cases. One night me and my friend @ORGANIZATION1 went to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2 for some food and when we were done we went to @ORGANIZATION1's house for the night. It was a good day for us so we were laughing a lot that day, sometimes it was at little things that didn't even matter. To me @ORGANIZATION1 was hilarious that night. I didn't even think it was possible for her to be that funny, it was a huge surprise to me.  I was sitting on her bed talking to my boyfriend and she was sitting on the floor. I had no idea what she was doing, but I thought it'd be best not to question what she was doing. Then I started hearing this spraying sound, I became curious on what she was doing. I just let her do her thing while I continued my conversation. Soon after I heard the spraying sound I started to smell body spray, after I smelled the body spray I began to taste it. It was a disgusting taste.  I look on the ground and I see @ORGANIZATION1 just spraying the body spray and laughing. Her laughter got interrupted by her coughing. Her coughing sounded like a dog choking. She continued to cough on the smell of body spray for a minute or two then her coughing turned into laughter. Her laugh sounded like a hyena, not an ordinary hyena either, it sounded like a wild hyena. Then she started rolling on the floor continuing her hyena laugh for a couple of minutes. The room became very quiet then, not an ordinary quiet, it was more of an eerie quiet. The eerie quiet made me a little frightened for what was going to happen next. All of a sudden the eerie quiet ended with @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""@CAPS2,"" and walking out of the room. I started laughing so hard at that, I couldn't control my laughter. @ORGANIZATION1 came back into the room with food and asked me why I was laughing so hard. I told her what happened and she didn't remember doing that. She started laughing and then I started laughing.  It felt like we were laughing for days. Our stomachs started to ache because we were laughing so hard. I wouldn't trade that stomach ache I got for anything. It helped make an amazing memory with a lot of laughter.",37.0,6.0
8," So some people say laughter helps put you in a better mood right? Yes. Well I believe that is very true because it helped my best friend @PERSON1 once when she came over and she was not in the greatetest mood. So I thought I would cheer up and make her laugh and smile and get whatever it was that was bothering her off her mind. So we watched some @CAPS1.V. and had a few laughs at that. Then we went outside to go for a walk and play in the snow. While we were on this walk we almost fell over a lot of times because it was also slippery outside too!  It was funny because everytime one of us almost fell we'd grab on to each other to help us keep out balance, but one time she grabbed me off guard and we both fell. It happened so quick I didn'@CAPS1 realized what had happened until we was on the ground in the cold cold snow. That was a very painful fall that it made @PERSON1 and I laugh very hard. So after we fell over and had our laugh,we got up and brushed ourselves off and made our way back to my house. We get back to my house,go inside take our wet shoes off by the door and then stand by the fireplace to warm our bodies up. About @NUM1 minutes we was standing there and @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS2 man, my socks are all wet!"" We laugh again.  I tell her it's fine I'll let you borrow a pair of mine. So we walk to my room and I get her a pair of my socks and she puts them on. We sit on my bed and breathe deeply after all our laughter outside. Then I asked her if she was happier than when she first got to my house? She replys, yes @CAPS3 thank you! I tell her no need to thank me im your best friend it's what I'm here for. Everyone needs laughter to help make them feel better, and so that's what I did. Then we went into the k itchen and made some cookies and brownies to eat.They were delicious, @LOCATION1 and I had so much fun make them that we lost track of how much we had made. So far we had made two dozens of cookies and one dozen of brownies, we laughed. Good thing we had my grandma and two brothers to help us eat them. So we shared with them and they all enjoy them so glad we had extra of them! Over all this story certainly proves that laughter helps put you in a better mood, like I did for my best friend @PERSON1. I really believe that statement because I know it by experience and also because it works with me all the time! Or simply try making whatever it is bothering you into a joke so you don'@CAPS1 feel so stressed out about it. I can certainly say that laughing puts everyone in a great mood.",35.0,6.0
8,"              Where can a simple smile take you? For most people a simple smile is worthless. For me a smile is an adventure, people smile and laugh all over the world there's no place where you can't find a smile. A simple smile started a adventure for me. It all started with a smile him at the lunch table in the cafeteria sitting with his friends. And me at the table next to his with my friends. My friends and I were done with our lunch we left outside for a walk. While we were walking somebody came and push me and I almost felt into a spill of a nasty looking chocolate milk. My friend @PERSON2 grab me just in time. It was embarrassing I had everybody's eyes on me.  The next day I was running down the hall to biology, I didn't wanted to be late for class I had a presentation to do. I walk in to class and when I sat down I saw him, talking to my friend @CAPS1. I got so nervous, he couldn't stop looking at me so I smile, the next thing you know he is walking towards me. I had no idea of what to do I stand up and walk towards my friend @CAPS2, I turn around and see him leaving. As soon as he walk out the door I go rushing to @CAPS1 and asked him questions. As soon as class was over @CAPS1 came and talk to me, he told me that his name is @PERSON3 that he has know him for a while. I was shocked, I didn't know what to say just walk away. When I got home I was so happy that even my sister got surprise. She came up to me and told me if I was doing drugs or anything like that. I smile and said no, that I just had a happy day at school. She wanted to know what was up, but I knew she was going to tell my parents if I had told her anything. I just couldn't wait for school tomorrow. The next day at lunch, I went for a walk with my friend @CAPS5 when we were entering the building I saw @PERSON3 with @CAPS1 I got nervous, @CAPS5 notice, she just started laughing. When we walk past them when we were about to open the door, I heard somebody call my name.When I turn back I saw it was @PERSON3 who called me. I couldn't believe that he was actually talking to me. We went for a walk we got to know each other. When the bell rang he walk me to my class. At class my friend @PERSON2 saw me talking to him, she wanted to know everything, since @PERSON2 is like a sister to me I told her everything. Days past an at every lunch I spend with him he would always make me laugh. I had a good time with him. One day he ask me out, and we started dating. I was extremely happy. When I told my friends, they were happy that I was going out with somebody. After several days my friends change their opinion about @PERSON3.I didn't understand why they change their mind about him so fast. After a while @PERSON2 told me that she change her mind because she found out that he was a bad guy. I didn't believe her, I had a good time with him. He would make me forget about my problems. She said I was crazy for still dating him I didn't care what she think. Some days past he stop coming to school I wonder what was wrong. I ask his uncle @PERSON4 and his niece @CAPS8, but they wouldn't tell me anything. Until I finally talk to his sister @PERSON1. She told me he was on house arrest I couldn't believe it. When I finally got to talk to him he explain it all. When he came back we were back to having a good time. I always felt conferable been with him. I was leaving to @LOCATION1 for winter break.. I wasn't going to see @PERSON3 for a while. Days past and he stop showing up for school I wasn't sure if I wanted to know what was going on this time. One morning @PERSON4 give me a phone number, he told me to call it I found out it was @PERSON3. After a while he called an broke up with me for no reason. I decide to have fun with my friends at school and forget about him. Well my ending with @PERSON3 wasn't happy. But it all started with a smile. And from that smile a adventure happen. A smile is worth more than words. You never know were that smile will take you whether is to find a friend or maybe the right person. You will just have to take the risk and find out. It's always and experience where a smile can take you.                 ",36.0,6.0
8,"People have a lot of sayings about laughter. Usually, this sayings express the importance of laughter as a part of human's life. People in @LOCATION1 believe, that he who laughs a lot is getting extra time of a life. Despite I don't know for how much every minute of laughing extends my life, I am pretty sure, that I will never die.The gloominess was attacking me severely from the very beginning of the @DATE2. Being an exchange in a state with a climate totally opposite to the climate in your native country was challenge-full. Every time when it was rainy-and it is rainy in @LOCATION2 almost all the time-I would get upset and start missing sunshine. I didn't want to talk to people at all-everyone seemed unattractive and boring, so I literally hadn't anyone to talk with. I had started to count days till @DATE1 hoping it would had been snowy-but @NUM1 wasn't snowy as I expected. It was rainy. Rain, rain, rain, every day. After several month of staying in @LOCATION2 I suddenly realized that I didn't have friends. I partly knew, that not only the weather affects my life, and that I should have spoken and smiled to people. But I didn't used to it! Fortunately, one day everything changed. One my classmate invited me for her birthday party. I didn't know her very well, but I really wanted to go-why not? I knew that I shouldn't have missed possibility to have fun at the party with other kids. When I came to the party I saw some people who I knew before from school and some who I had never seen before. I started panicking, because I got used to get confused in a company of people who I don't know. Party was going on and on, we started to play some games which I've never played before. I wasn't really very interested in a participation or winning, so I was just sitting and staring at somebody's silly drawing on a piece of paper. Suddenly that guy, who was sitting next to me, randomly pointed on it and started to laugh, so loudly, candidly and - and something else, what made me want to laugh, so I looked at the picture with this drawing of funny face! It was the funniest thing which I had ever seen. So I exploded with this laughter. I just randomly found somebody's picture entertaining. I was kind of feeling uncomfortable in a first second afterward, but other people payed attention at the picture and they actually started to laugh too! After that I felt like I was set free. I knew all the people at the party-we played lots of games, and they were entertaining and really interesting. I couldn't stop joking and everyone laughed at my jokes. Oh, and I got acquainted with the laughing guy- he was a really nice person, and now he is one of my best friends.I can't say that if you laugh once it would make you super-self-confident, would instantly give you million friends or would give you the best job ever. But I am pretty sure, that ability to laugh- critically at yourself or kindly at others-is a talent, which we have to discover in ourselves, better sooner, than later. Because life is so short for being sad and disappointed. Don't worry about how are you going to look like when you are getting a cheerful laughing explosion-just feel free to express your emotions with a laughter because it is the best way to express them ever!",41.0,7.0

Laughing can make you take your mind off of anything that's negative going aroundits kinda like a little cure in a way. Its always good to have some laughter in life in my opinion to show you have a scene of humor and that your not always serious.Also making jokes and bonding in that type of way is a good way to start friendships. Some times laughing can make you feel more comfortable in some situations. You can always have a good day if people are nice and make you laugh it always feels good to make other people laugh too.My grandpa (@PERSON1) is a very good example, when he try's to get his point across he will put it kinda in a joke so you aren't offended in anyway..",32.0,5.0
8," Laughter- it is part of a persons everyday life. People laugh when they are happy, sad, excited, and even nervous. Sometimes when there is nothing to be said, people just need a good laugh. One can tell when a person has not had a good laugh for a while. You can @CAPS16 @CAPS5 expression on their face, it looks as if life had just drained from them. I believe that the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" to be true. Laughter can connect two people, even a group of people, fast.   Not only is laughter enjoyable, it is also healthy for you. It is able to relive a person from stress and depression. Here is a story about @CAPS10 a little laughter can go a long way. It was her first day of high school. @CAPS2 was so excited. As @CAPS2 stepped out on the high school pavement, @CAPS2 felt a sense of importance for @CAPS2 wasn't in junior high any more. @CAPS2 was speed walking through the halls, trying not to be late for her first class of the day. @CAPS2 noticed all of the other students with their brand new school outfits and with their shiny new shoes. ""@CAPS1,"" @CAPS2 thought ""they look so cool, i want to be like them."" @CAPS2 looked down at her torn jeans and her scratched up shoes. Forgetting @CAPS2 had classes in less than a minute, @CAPS2 hurried and ran to her first class. ""@CAPS3!"" The bell startled her as @CAPS2 was doodling on her paper while the teacher was lecturing about something of the geography of @LOCATION1. @CAPS2 quickly crammed all her books and notes into her backpack and followed the rest of her peers out the door. Lunch time. This was the students favorite part of the day. As @CAPS2 entered the cafeteria it reminded her of a shopping mall with people running around everywhere. The geeks, the jocks , the skaters, @CAPS9 had their own table with their own group of friends except one person. @CAPS2 was standing there looking out. ""@CAPS4 I should just go eat in the hallway."" @CAPS2 thought to herself. As @CAPS2 turned around @CAPS2 thought once again, ""@CAPS5, if I'm going to be here I'm going to need to make some friends."" @CAPS2 entered out into the lunch room with full confidence, @CAPS5 one was going to stop her.  @CAPS2 walked around from table to table. @CAPS5 one even noticed her, as if @CAPS2 were a ghost. @CAPS2 finally reached the back table and saw a boy, sitting all by himself, eating lunch. Before @CAPS2 could even think, @CAPS2 sat down and started a random conversation with the boy. @CAPS11 looked up bewildered. As @CAPS2 stopped talking, @CAPS11 looked up at her and said, ""@CAPS7 are you talking to me, don't you know who I am?"" @CAPS2 looked at him with a blank face. ""@CAPS9 thinks I'm trash, I'm not worth anything. @CAPS7 even bother sitting with me and pretending you're my friend?"" @CAPS11 stated. Her heart sank all the way to the floor. @CAPS2 had pity for him.""@CAPS10 could someone treat you like this? They have @CAPS5 right."" @CAPS11 looked at her as if that was the first time any one had ever said any thing like that to him. @CAPS2 began to talk to him more. Everyday @CAPS2 would sit next to him at the lunch table and @CAPS5 one would even bother to look down and say, ""@CAPS12!""  One day as they were eating lunch together, @CAPS2 turned to him and said,""I was just thinking, I have never heard you laugh before."" ""Is that a bad thing?"" @CAPS11 said with confusion. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS17! @CAPS9 needs a good laugh."" @CAPS2 said.As they began to talk more, the boy told the girl that @CAPS11 has had @CAPS5 reason to laugh. His family is broken, @CAPS11 has @CAPS5 friends, and the teachers hate him. In fact, @CAPS11 couldn't even remember the last time @CAPS11 had a good laugh. ""@CAPS14,"" @CAPS2 stood up boldly, ""I will help you laugh."" @CAPS11 chuckled at her.""@CAPS16!"" @CAPS2 shouted. ""That doesn't count!"" @CAPS11 yelled back.""@CAPS17 it does. Even a little chuckle can lead to a big hearty laugh."" @CAPS2 stated.  The next day at the lunch table @CAPS2 noticed something was different about the boy, something had changed. As @CAPS2 drew closer @CAPS2 noticed a big smile across his face. ""I haven't been this happy in a long time!"", @CAPS11 said with his eyes beaming. ""I want to thank you in every way I can."" @CAPS2 looked at him with confusion. @CAPS11 laughed really loud. ""I haven't laughed like that since I don't know when. You made me @CAPS16 that through any circumstance I was going through, it is important to laugh. I just needed someone to tell me that."" A big smile stretched across her face. @CAPS2 was so happy, though @CAPS2 was small and didn't know any one, @CAPS2 was able to make a difference in a boys life by one of the greatest gifts of all, laughter.

8," Im afraid i dont quite understand, your saying that all i have to do is implement laughter into the story as a part or element of the story? That just seems a little ridiculous to me, after all there could be @CAPS1 of parts/elements in a story. What exactly is the point of even making this one of our choices for a topic. For that matter, how can you even call it a topic? when i looked at this my initial idea was to simply create some story that made laughter play some part in it that was far from integral, but now im just curious. is this the point, you guys give us a bunch of crappy topics to choose from but really the point of it is to get us to find loopholes so the we dont have to be so bland? Or is this an obstacle, giving us topics which have the ability for us to go off on something completly different just so you can fail us. Thats not very nice you know, i dont know how you sleep at night. i can see you people now laughing about how you purposely put things in the test to make kids fail. whats little @PERSON1, who has been diagnosed with A.D.H.D. supposed to do about this? Its not his fault he cant keep his mind on the same subject for more than two seconds, and here you go creating subjects that make normal people stray, you should be ashamed of yourselves! How can you even call yourselves teachers after doing something like this!

8,"      Laughter In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 In @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I have connected with people in many different ways. In ways such as through conversations and through the internet, but the most significant means of connecting with people that has influenced @CAPS1 @CAPS2 the most is laughter. When I am around other people @CAPS1 primary goal in the conversation is to make them laugh. I do this because when you are funny and make people laugh they tend to gravitate to you. When you make a person laugh you form bonds with that person. Even two complete strangers can form these bonds of friendship through laughter almost instantly.  Such an occasion of this bond was a two years ago, I was in the eighth grade. I met a person named @PERSON1. @PERSON1 was a fairly odd person, and so I never did approach him to start a conversation. I went the entire year believing he was just a weird person. Nothing eventful ever happened between the two of us. Until freshman year came around. In the beginning of freshman year I met @PERSON1 again, but this time I actually talked to him. In this conversation I realized that @PERSON1 was a very funny person, and that he was not odd at all. I can only assume that he also thought I was funny because we became instant friends. Our friendship had only become stronger and stronger as the year progressed, thanks to the laughter that we shared. That was not the only time that laughter played a major role in our friendship. During the @DATE1 break after our first year of high school. @PERSON1 and I got in a very big fight. We were no longer talking, and it looked like our friendship had died permanently. Several weeks passed by with a word never uttered, but one day we happened to be together at a friends house (at the time we didn't know each other would be present). Eventually I said a funny joke. It filled the room with laughter. At that time @PERSON1 and I realized that we weren't really mad at each other, and so we became friends again. To this day @PERSON1 and I have remained best friends. Laughter has brought me friends, and helped me keep them. It has probably been the most influential force in @CAPS1 @CAPS2. ",37.0,6.0
8," A true story in which laughter was an element was when I was on the run. I know what you would be thinking that being on the run is no laughing matter. In my case I pictured it differently.When I ran I did not know anybody in this town which was called @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The day I ran I met a guy named @CAPS3.I sat down behind @ORGANIZATION1 and drank some wine with him. We started talking and I told him what my situation was like and he told me his friend @PERSON4 has a place open for me to stay at. I thanked him for his help and met up with his friend @PERSON4. He was a nice guy and the place that was open was his friends place where @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 were staying. They let me into their house without any questions asked and I am very gratefu for that. That night we had an airsoft war out in front of their house.We all had lots of welts from the plastic pellets. The next day when I woke up @PERSON5 said he was going to stop by his mother's house. I went with them and found out his mother lived on @LOCATION1 street. His mother's name was @PERSON2 but she goes by @CAPS4. While I was there I met her roommate @PERSON1.He was a slob so I didn't think much about him. There was a girl there around my age that was just visiting her name was @CAPS5.

Every day we laugh, even when we're @CAPS9 in the best mood. we always find room in our day for a big hearty laugh. a little chuckle or a random giggle. laughter is our medicine. we have all had our days where things just don't go right. instead of just standing there @CAPS9 know what to do. we hold our dear friend in trouble @CAPS2 start telling them memories that bring us all into great laughter. we sometimes have those moments when were laughing so hard we cant even finish the story, or barely start it because just the thought of it brings us to laughter. Laughter comes in many ways from a small chuckle to a ""stop-it-my-stomach-is-cramping-I-can-barely-breath"" laugh.   For example one time me @CAPS2 a couple of friends were outside jumping on my trampoline when all of a sudden it collapsed on us! it was the funniest thing to watch. Me @CAPS2 my friend @ORGANIZATION1 were sitting down when this whole ordeal happened @CAPS2 we just saw everyone in slow motion. Shalynn was trying to roll away from the safety nets pole @CAPS4 @CAPS5 was trying @CAPS9 to land awkwardly @CAPS2 my brother @PERSON1 was still in the air flailing his arms. finally when it all got silent we burst out laughing. that was the most funniest thing that has ever happened. we tried to fix it the best we could so it wouldn't look broken. @CAPS2 it looked pretty convincing except it was a bit lopsided. but besides that it was okay. the day after we told everyone about the broken trampoline @CAPS2 @CAPS3 laughed too. the hallways were so full of our laughter. My friend @PERSON2 was pretty sad because she loved the trampoline. We told her she could come over to see it one last time @CAPS2 she agreed. when we got home she saw the trampoline @CAPS2 @CAPS6 ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8! it is @CAPS9 broken!"" then she ran to the trampoline @CAPS2 tried to get on. I was about to tell her @CAPS9 to, but @CAPS5 told me to stay quiet, @CAPS2 so I did. as she got on the trampoline it stayed put. We were kind of surprised because it was badly broken. A few seconds @CAPS11 when @CAPS12 it collapses to an extent where @CAPS7 cant even put it back together to look like it wasn't broken! @PERSON2 came out of the ruble with grass all over her clothes. their was an eerie quiet for a minute. but after that @CAPS5 burst out laughing! the kind of laugh where he's literally rolling on the floor. every one was laughing there. even my mom @CAPS2 my baby brother who was crying the day before breaking it. @PERSON2 @CAPS6 at us for @CAPS9 warning her that is was broken. we had to remind her that she was the first one we told, but she didn't believe us. when the thought finally processed she was the one laughing the hardest. I really miss those moments of laughter. @CAPS2 those days when I'm feeling down I go back to those memories just so I could get a good laugh. I know those memories are in the past but im pretty sure we all @CAPS5 have plenty more of those memories in the future. @CAPS2 I'll look back to those memories.",39.0,6.0

Everyday my friends and I would play @NUM2 on @NUM2 basketball during lunch. We had a constant routine we would do at lunch, which was to eat for exactly @NUM4 minutes and play for the remaining of time.

It was @CAPS2 @NUM5, lunch had barely started and on my way to @LOCATION1S i noticed a girl crying her eyes out as she was basically sprinting towards the bathrooms. I later found out her name was @PERSON1. I got to @LOCATION1S, sat down, and started thinking why she was crying. I was curious. @PERSON1 walks in and sits down right across from me. Her eyes were red and she was holding multiple tissues in her hand. At first there was an awkward silence in the room, but out of no where she turns @CAPS2 and said "" can i borrow your pencil"". She had the sweetest most angelic voice @CAPS3 ever heard, and for a split second i thought she was an angel. With out any regards I immediately said yes, I mean she was very attractive. Than she said with her angelic voice "" thank you very much"". I was melting inside. Without any other words I sat in silenced as she was using my pencil. Lunch was over, she returned my pencil without saying anything, just a smile and walked of.  The next day I really wanted to see her and talk to her, so between my classes i would walk @CAPS2 the hall ways and peak in every room just to find her. I was so desperate to see her that i purposely told the teacher to shut up, knowing i would get a lunch detention. And of course, I did.  Lunch came, and i was never excited to go to detention until that day. I arrived at @LOCATION1S @NUM6 minutes early, i sat down just staring at the door waiting for @PERSON1 to walk in.

The guy almost every girl was in love with and most of the guys didn't like. He was in my shop and art classes, and sat with me a lot. I talked about him all the time and @PERSON2 didn't know who he was, so one morning at breakfast, i decided to show her who he was. She thought he was cute, too. @PERSON1 and I started talking a lot and we became friends. I told @PERSON2 that I liked him, and she told me to go for it. So I did. A few days after I got rejected, he asked @PERSON2 out. She said yes. I was so mad, but I tried not to show it. I told her I liked him, and then she started dating him. It hurt and I didn't understand why she would do that to me.  After that, she became my friend and @PERSON1 became my best friend. I got used to the fact that they were dating, but it still bothered me and made me mad when they would hug in front of me or when @PERSON1 would tell me the kissed. They were together for four or five months. They got into an argument and broke up. They were always fighting. Two day's later, he asked me out and I said yes. I was so happy and everyone told me that we made a better couple than him and @PERSON2 did and that made me happy, because we trusted and knew each other @PERCENT1. Him and @PERSON2 weren't like that at all. She always tried to change him. I never did, because I liked him the way he was. @PERSON1 and I walked to lunch holding hands, so people knew we were together. When we sat down, @PERSON2 wasn't there. I got up to look for her, and when I found her, she wouldn't even look at me. We started fighting, and I didn't understand what the big problem was. I knew him and liked him before @PERSON2 did, so I thought I deserved a chance to be with him. I walked away from her because she wouldn't let me explain anything, it was frustrating, and I thought I was going to punch her.  @PERSON1 and I were off and on for a couple months, and everything between me and @PERSON2 was good again. The last time @PERSON1 and I broke up, was the worst. We fought everyday. @PERSON2 started dating him a few day's after we broke up that last time. I was so mad. Her and I fought all the time again. I still rode home with her, still got a ride to the bus stop with her, but we never talked. one day we were riding back to our houses and I said something funny and she laughed. Then I laughed, and we couldn't stop laughing. We became friends again. We made a promise that it wouldn't happen ever again. Laughing makes everything better; especially when your sad. Whenever @PERSON2 and I hang out, we never stop laughing. I can't believe we fought over a stupid boy, that we both don't talk to that much anymore. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. Laughing is my favorite thing to do. That's all I'm ever doing!",40.0,7.0
8," I @MONTH1 not be the funniest person alive, but I have the occasional big laugh. I am the kind of guy who is funny randomly without trying, and then when i try to be funny I stink terribly at it. My friends and I love to joke around with each other. All day we sit around and laugh our butts off, Laughter is a key element in all of our relationships, at least I know it is in mine. My friends and I have this little thing we do, a ritual I guess @CAPS2 can call it. Every weekend after a game we drive into town and go to @ORGANIZATION2. Once we are done at @ORGANIZATION2's we go to @ORGANIZATION1 and each of us buys one of these cheap @MONEY1 two liter pops. We drive out of town onto one of the back roads and chug it, this thing we do is called the ""@NUM1-liter @CAPS1."" The objective in this is to completely drink your two liter of pop and throw up first. This @MONTH1 seem easy, but it is actually very hard, the carbonation fills up your stomach like a balloon until it finally has to come out somewhere. Doing this is really quite pointless considering that @CAPS2 don't really win anything, but it is very funny to watch other people throw up when or even before they are done drinking their pop. This all started when we saw a video of someone doing it on @CAPS2-tube, we loved it and decided to to try it and we also created a video. It's always a good laugh. Me and my friends are not really all that much the same, they are more the athletic cool kids and I guess I am more of the smart kid who just follows them around. Really one of the only things we share is our sense of humor, the smallest thing we think is funny and we will laugh about it all day. It is surprising how laughter can bring completely opposite people together. At the best and worst of times having a good laugh with your friends or with anyone can always bring a smile. My friends are some of the best and funniest people I know, just five minutes with them and I can guarantee a smile. I don't know what I would do without them, I don't know if I would have been able to make it through these past couple of years without them. Five years ago or so my parents got into a divorce, life then and even life now has been difficult. Your home is supposed to be your safe place to go when @CAPS2 are having a rough time, when @CAPS2 have the whole world on your back. It should be the place where none of your problems matter. My safe place isn't at my home , my safe place is at my friends houses. There it doesn't matter how screwed up things @MONTH1 be , I can just relax , have a couple of good laughs, and forget about the world. My friends @MONTH1 be the most ridiculous people on the planet, but that is exactly why I love them they can always make me laugh. :) ",36.0,6.0
8," After winning the @ORGANIZATION2 cheerleading competieion, my friends and @CAPS1 our parents to take us dress shopping. Amazingly, they said yes. So we headed off to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to search for the perfect @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 dress. We arived at the mall around @NUM1 p.m and went straight to @ORGANIZATION3. We were there for at least three hours trying on dresses. Amazingly we crammed six people into one tiny dressing room. While we were in the dressing room our parents were taking pictures of us in each of our dresses so we could see what they looked like in pictures. As we were looking through the pictures deciding which ones we liked best, all we could look at was @ORGANIZATION4's naked butt in the background of every picture. It was so hilarious because our parents had already sent the pictures to all of our family and close friends! @ORGANIZATION4's face turned bright red as soon as she realised this. After we had tried on our last dresses, we knew exactly which ones we wanted. @ORGANIZATION4, the outgoing and vibrant friend in the bunch, got a tightly fitted purple dress with rainbow sequins. Hannah, my meek and bashful friend, ended up buying a black and aqua flower patterned dress that made her look like she was @NUM2 instead of @NUM3. Finally, i decided on a white tightly fitted at the top and loos at the bottom dress with gold jewels on it. After buying our dresses, we were absolutely famished. We rushed down to @CAPS5 @PERSON1's and each got a pretzel and soda. As we were sitting and choking down this disgusting mall food, we saw a lady walk out of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. She was wearing rainbow socks, four inch heels, a bright yellow rain hat, a short leather skirt, and a florecent red shirt with a giant ostrige on it. As the lady was walking away, we all turned to eachother with the most confused looks on our faces and started laughing histarically. I had so much fun shopping for our @ORGANIZATION1 dresses. That lady who walked out of @CAPS6 @CAPS7, was so hilarious that I am still laughing about it to this day. I hope that everybody has a special funny story.",36.0,6.0
8," Many people think that laughter is an important part in any kind of relationship. I think the statement is true; well for me at least. In my story laughter is a big part and it brings the people who are involved closer. It was a hot @DATE1 day, all the neighbor kids were outside playing in the sprinklers. It was the perfect settingn to have fun and cool down. My sister @PERSON1 and I were outside in the back yard tanning. We had our music playing, our ice teas sitting next to us, and no one home to bother us.About an hour after we are settled in we hear ""you girls look like you need to cool down!"" then we see a giant blue water balloon being hurdled over the fence; it was heading right towards us! It landed right at our feet just barely getting us wet, but still enough to make us mad. We start yelling at the neighbor boys, but all they do is laugh. @PERSON1 and I then decide to take matters into our own hands, we had had enough of their immaturity for the @DATE1. We ran inside and filled two buckets full of water balloons and declared war! In the beginning, we were gruesomely throwing the water balloons to get back at the boys. Later it came to me, my sister and I were laughing too hard to return any balloons! We were laughing @CAPS1 hard. We couldn't even stop long enough to throw a simple water balloon. We would throw one wait for it to hit then crack up over the sound of it hitting the boys! Unfortunately the boys were throwing twice as many balloons than we were. I was just about to reach for another balloon @CAPS1 we wouldn't loose to the boys, when i hear my sister yell ""duck!"" @CAPS1 I ducked and then i heard the biggest splash when the huge water bucket was tossed over at us. I was soaked, absolutely soaked! I looked at my sister and of course she was laughing harder then than she was before! She didn't even get a single drop of water on her, just me! At first I was mad at her for laughing at me then I couldn't help but laugh because she was laughing @CAPS1 hard. She almost wet her pants! We must have been laughing for too long or the reaction of us laughing was not what the boys wanted because when we were having the time of our lives, the boys retreated and went into their house. My sister threw a balloon but we didn't hear the boys yell or anything. I got some guts and looked through the fence. The boys were gone! We felt like fools for not knowing they had left. We could only imagine the boys laughing and making fun of us at this point.  Now after the water balloon fight, which was years ago, we look back at that day and realize that that's the day where our friendship began. If they wouldn't have thrown the balloon we would not be friends. Also not only did we make friends with the boys my sister and I got @CAPS1 much closer because now we learned we can laugh at each other without making the other one mad. The whole experience was just the best for everyone. ",36.0,6.0
8," I have known @PERSON1 since we were three years old. Together we have seen each other through our parent's divorces, deaths of family members, and the everyday trials and tribulations of growing up. We have cried, danced, sang, and played with each other. But most of all, we have laughed. Our laughter has been heard throughout the land: from the many houses I have lived in, and the few she has inhabited; all across @LOCATION2- from coast to desert; not to mention the times we have giggled in other states. For this, and many other reasons, she is my best friend. If I were to attempt to speak of all the wondrous times I have had in her company, the resulting novel would be longer than a multi-volume encyclopedia. So I will instead write about just a few excellent experiences, each one filled with its own unique, boisterous laughter.  When we were younger, most likely about eight years old, @PERSON1 and I used to run away. Not because we had particularly difficult childhoods or troubled households, but simply because we wanted to try living by ourselves. So we would cram our wee bags full of the objects we could not survive without. These packs of necessities included: our favorite stuffed animals, blankets and pillows, games we enjoyed, flashlights, umbrellas, and usually some delectable treats. We gathered it all up, stuffed it into my big red wagon, secured it with a jump rope, and set of into the world. On occasion we brought my little brother, @PERSON2, along for the ride. He would normally be squished into the wagon with all the equipment. Though we never traversed any farther than the field at the end my street, we always had a marvelous time- even if it was rainy or cold. And all the while we would laugh. We would snicker conspiratorially as we stole outside, laugh out loud as we went down the block, and giggle nervously as night began to fall. Before a few hours had passed we would be safely wrapped in the warmth of our cozy home, but those hours were exciting times when we proved that we could survive outside societies standards. @PERSON1 and I reestablish that we have no need for society when we go on our annual ""dads and kids"" camping trip. Though the number of participants and the exact location has changed over the @DATE1 seven years, the basic format has stayed constant. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, our fathers, and I fill two cars with gear and drive to the @LOCATION2 coast. Once there we spend most of our time at the campsite, hearing the same campfire stories, making s'mores, swiming in the river, and rafting to the @LOCATION1. But @DATE1 was a bit different. Instead of heading west towards the water, we went east to the peaks; eventually ending up at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. And it is absolutely dazzling there: fresh mountain air, twenty minutes from @ORGANIZATION1, and the @CAPS2 is so beautifully transparent that the bottom is easily visible all the way in the middle. The @CAPS2 is quite aptly named, unfortunately, that beauty comes with a price. The @CAPS2 is so very @CAPS1 because it is a constant thirty four degrees @DATE1 round. Consequently, it takes a bit of time to become acclimated while swimming in the frigid water. Regardless, we still have a phenomenal time, and now consider ourselves experts at setting up tents.  But despite our tough survivor girl exteriors, @PERSON1 and I are quite desperately dependent on the technologies of the day. Together we have watched countless television shows on @ORGANIZATION2, listened to heaps of songs on @CAPS3, and even made a few movies ourselves on iMovie. For example, I remember the first ""full length"" (and by that I mean five minutes long) movie we collaborated on. It is called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"", and though it has almost no plot, it was stunningly fun to create. We were about ten years old and we knew, unequivocally, that we wanted to be famous in the film business when we grew up. So we thought and we brainstormed until we finally came up with an idea. Though it @MONTH1 not have been the most brilliant idea out there, it was ours. Two ordinary citizens (masterfully portrayed by @PERSON2 and @PERSON1) were having an argument over which came first: peace and war, or love and hate. A huge battle erupted, consisting of first hours, then days, and eventually weeks of pillow fighting! It felt as if it would go on forever, until @CAPS4 @CAPS5 steps in to save the day! In the end the bloopers were longer than the story itself, but we still go into hysterics every time we watch the film. It is a source of entertainment we shall never forget.  I suppose I have now managed to condense one of my most important relationships into four measly paragraphs. I spoke of the laughter we have shared: hushed, thunderous, timid, and unabashed. So remember, life is arduous, and having a best friend to share the joy is absolutely essential.   ",42.0,7.0
8,"Laughter is the best medicine. This is a quote I have heard many times, and it seems to be easier said than done. A new school, new language, and no one who understands you can make anyone scared and uncomfortable, and laughter isn't always the antidote. Although, laughter with people you love and care for can also be a welcome relief from fear and worry. As my family's travels took us through @LOCATION1, laughter and happiness were the best ways to brighten a difficult day, give us courage, and make new friends. The most consoling laughter is that remembered. Moments that once seemed trivial now bring happy tears to my eyes. The moments associated with laughter are the ones I hold nearest to my heart. Memories that give me the most happiness are those of laughing with family and friends. When my little sister @CAPS1 and I stepped off the airplane in @LOCATION9, @LOCATION5, we were taken aback. Everything was bustling around us. There were taxi drivers calling out, hotel bellhops throwing pamphlets, and family members awaiting their arrivals. The taxi we hired was a respite from the world of @LOCATION1 outside. Many hours later, the four of us were safe in our hotel beds, but the two youngest of our family were nervous. My sister and I were jet-lagged and homesick, and were trying to cling to familiarity however we could. Board games served that purpose. Playing a familiar game in a new place brings up a lot of memories.Through the magic of @CAPS2 and laughing with our loving family, @CAPS1 and I were ready to tackle the challenges of living on a new continent. Living in @LOCATION5 was very different from living in @LOCATION7. Not only the language, but the culture was also notably contrasting to @LOCATION1's. The way people dressed, acted, and communicated were radically different in the southern hemisphere. With so much diversity around, it was extremely difficult to be comfortable going to school. After a day of trying to comprehend math lessons and @CAPS4 literature, home was very soothing. The bus ride home was a beacon of light, because it gave us hope for the comforting times during family dinner in our small @CAPS5 apartment. Every day I would calculate the weeks till the plane ride home, but I had a feeling that day would never @CAPS8. However, we knew each challenging day would be over soon enough, and jokes and anecdotes from home would give us the stamina to continue learning. Game time was relaxing for each family member, and we cherished those times, filled with laughter. Walking down the streets of a new city and country was unnerving. Cars swerved and honked, people rushed past, and buildings towered over us, with billboards supporting companies we had never heard of. Feeling safe in that environment was a stretch, and we were always on our toes. It took me about four months to become used to the daily routine. Morning: @CAPS6-up at @NUM1 am, catch the bus at @TIME1 and go to @CAPS4 school. Afternoon: @CAPS8 home on the bus, have a snack at the apartment, run errands, go to our language tutor and @CAPS8 home for homework, dinner, and bedtime. The next day it was repeated, and life was becoming average. However, it was then that our family uprooted again. We trekked around @LOCATION11 and the @LOCATION3, following something we called the @ORGANIZATION2, a mock @ORGANIZATION4. We began in @LOCATION12, then jetted to the desert and the city of @LOCATION4. Next we re-entered @ORGANIZATION2 domain, and visited @CAPS9, @LOCATION2 (a @LOCATION2 at @NUM2 feet), @LOCATION10, and @ORGANIZATION3. Seeing each landmark close-up was amazing. It was like each one had @CAPS8 out of a @ORGANIZATION1, and we were there to write an article about each. Also, we met other @CAPS10 speaking families on our travels. Interacting with other adventurers was comforting, and learning their stories was inspiring. Even travelers we had nothing in common with-like a man from @LOCATION6 who was traveling @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION8 with only his bicycle and a few bags-could relate to our feelings of isolation and struggle to learn the language. Through laughter and memories, we were able to make new friends, so far from both our homes. When you see a person's face light up after being told a funny story, it can make you smile too. Difficult times @CAPS8 upon everyone, and knowing that things will get better is a comforting thought. Far from home, and very susceptible to worries and fears, my sister and I relied on our parents and companions to console us and keep us open-minded. Without laughter, I would never have been able to overcome my fears and open myself to the learning experience. Thanks to the element of laughter, my family was able to enjoy our @CAPS11. Laughter was the best medicine for all of us, and it opened our hearts to the experience. By conquering fear with courage and happiness, the full effect of the trip was able to enrich our lives.",50.0,8.0
8," Laughter is a very important part of our lives. It is the greatest medicine for anything and everything. It is scientifically proven that if you are upset if you just smile even if you don't want to it will put you in a better mood. I do not like getting upset and try very hard not to, but when I am a competitive gymnast it is a part of everyday training. It is very rare that I have such a good day that I don't get upset once for five hours. I experienced how laughter helps keep me in a better mood.  Just the other day, @DATE2 the @NUM1 of @DATE1 I was having an off day. The warm up actually hadn't gone as bad as usual I started off okay, and the first event was not too bad. We started off on balance beam which usually just hearing the words ""go to beam"" puts me in a bad mood, but @DATE3 it wasn't half bad. We were supposed to do @NUM2 beam routines in @NUM3 minutes I did about @NUM4 which is the most I have ever done in one day. I felt pretty proud about that even though I fell on every single one of them, but I am starting to get used to it because beam isn't my best event. After beam we were on vault, I didn't do vault because I have a hurt wrist. So I just did some physical therapy for my wrist it was pretty easy. Then we got a break and I got to ice my injuries. After our @NUM5 minute break we started on bars. Bars is usually my favorite event but recently it has been pretty hard. I was having a really difficult time getting one routine done. I was starting to get upset when @PERSON1, my best friend, comes over and tells me some inside jokes to make me laugh. Being able to stand there and laugh with @PERSON1 made my day that much better.  @PERSON1 is one of my favorite people in the entire world. She always knows how to make me laugh even when I'm in a really bad mood. I don't know what I would do without her she is one of my best friends and an amazing teammate. After bars we were on our fourth and final event the floor exercise. I hadn't done floor in a long time because I recently sprained my wrist, but @DATE3 I figured I would give it a try. I was warming up one of my tumbling passes when I landed kind of weird. Pain shot up through my calf muscle it felt as if my muscle had torn in half. It was incredibly painful more painful than spraining my wrist. Since we are in competition season we can't stop when something hurts. Even though every single time I took a step my calf muscle hurt I had to try and make it through one full floor routine. I fell on my first pass then it was hurting too much so I didn't make my second pass. Then my coach was upset, and I start crying because my calf hurt so much. My coach didn't care of course, so I went in the bathroom so I could cry without getting yelled at.  I sat in the bathroom for about five seconds before @PERSON1 came in. She always knows exactly when I need her she told me everything was going to be okay. Then she told me some more jokes and I started laughing. It immediately made me feel ten times better. Her care to know when I needed her and the fact that she can make me laugh even when I'm in pain and upset gave me hope to go back out in the gym. My coach told me to do three more of my second pass. I did one and it hurt really bad I started crying again, but eventually I got all three done. My coach told me if it was really bad I could ice. I went in the kitchen and got some ice and wrapped it on my calf. It helped some but it still hurt to walk, so I was still somewhat crying. @PERSON1 seeing that I was still upset came over to me again and started singing out favorite song. Once again I started laughing and it made me feel ten times better.  I absolutely love @PERSON1 and envy her ability to make anybody laugh. Without her I don't think I would be able to go into the gym every single day. Those three times that she came up to me and made me laugh yesterday made it all worth it. I know no matter how bad I feel @DATE3 I will have @PERSON1 there to help me stay happy. Without laughter I don't think I would still do gymnastics. Laughter is a very large part of my life and I am very happy I have it, and wonderful friends who help me get through every day with happiness.",33.0,6.0
8," Laughter, @CAPS1 is it? Say someone makes a joke that is supposed to be a funny joke, but no one laughs after the joke has been told. If it is considered a ""funny joke"" then why did nobody laugh? To me laughter is something that I do when I find something funny or worth laughing at.  There are many different kinds of laughter. There's a chuckle kind of laugh where something is kind of funny but not funny enough to laugh hysterically at such as something funny on television. Then there is a laugh out loud kind of laugh where your making sound when you laugh but its not to the point where your laughing so hard that you have to gasp for air. Lastly there is a hysterical laugh. The hysterical laugh is where you laugh so hard where your abs start hurting because your laughing so hard. The hysterical laugh is the laugh where you gasp for air because you are laughing so hard that you have no time to breathe. Whatever it was it must have been really funny if you have forgotten to breathe.   Although there are many kinds of laughter there are many kinds of jokes such as, knock knock jokes, blond jokes, racist jokes, redneck jokes, yo mama jokes and many more. @CAPS1 type of world would this be without comedy? Without laughter your day to day activities would be no fun. Laughing gives you this feeling that you can't get without laughter. I think when you laugh it sends a chemical to your brain to let your brain know something funny happened so it can store that memory. You know how you forget stuff sometimes? Do you think if the events would've been funny you would've been able to remember them? Without laughter do you think everyone would be depressed? The times I laugh are the times I never forget because those are the best memories and the ones I want to remember the most.  I have this friend who I swear could be a comedian. He is the funniest guy I know. He can make me laugh without even trying, he just has that humorous personality that everyone loves because he's good at being the center of attention. Being funny just comes natural to him. The reason we have friends is so they can be there for you, but if they can't make you laugh wouldn't you consider them boring? When I make new friends usually the people that interest me most are the ones that aren't boring and who can make me laugh who I consider to be funny. Laughter is two different things, it is an action, and it is also a feeling. You can make yourself laugh at any time you want. Although when you laugh just to laugh you don't feel the same as you would when your laughing at something that really is funny. Laughter isn't necessarily a ""feeling"" but when you laugh it gives you a feeling of happiness. I can't think of a time when I have laughed for absolutely no reason unless someone told a joke that I didn't find funny but I figured I should laugh anyways and pretend it was funny to make them feel better about themselves.  In a relationship laughter is important. Can you imagine being in a relationship whether its with the opposite sex or if its just a friend kind of relationship and not laughing with one another? @CAPS1 would be the point? Yeah, you'll have someone there for you but when your crying or just down in general they wouldn't have a way to help you or cheer you up without trying to make you laugh. In a relationship where there is no laughter, would just be a boring relationship. Laughter is a hard thing to explain, without it everything would seem so boring. Since your used to laughing on a daily basis you don't notice how much you laugh because laughing is just a natural reaction. You don't control when you do or don't laugh. You can try not to laugh, but it doesn't always work. Have you ever noticed when something is really funny and you try not to laugh that after a couple seconds of trying not to laugh it just kind of blurts out all on its own.  Laughter usually comes from something funny. @CAPS1 exactly is the word ""funny?"" @CAPS1 does it even mean? I don't know the exact definition but I can almost guarantee if I looked it up in the dictionary that laughter would be under the word funny. We all know that laughter is a fun thing to do, because we all like laughing. I think that you could ask as many people as you want and they would all say they like laughing because its something we all do naturally. We don't know @CAPS1 its like to not laugh. In the end laughing is an important part of anything and everything we do. It makes the boring stuff fun, and it keeps the fun stuff from being boring.",40.0,7.0
8," Me, my sister @LOCATION1, my mom, my mom's friend @PERSON1, and @PERSON1's son @PERSON3 all decided to go to @PERSON2's in @LOCATION2. We were hanging out at the salon where my mom and @PERSON1 worked, and decided to go out for dinner because we have not seen or talked to each other in a while. We got done at the salon where my mom works at and then we all headed over to @ORGANIZATION1. My mom took me and @LOCATION1 in her silver car, while @PERSON1 took @PERSON3 with her in @CAPS1 red car.  We arrived at @ORGANIZATION1's so fast that we were waiting for @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 to arrive at the restaurant. When they arrived we all went in together and our waitress seated us at the big round booth. We started looking at our menus and then ordered some of there delicious food. I ordered a cheeseburger without bacon, my mom ordered quiche, my sister @LOCATION1 ordered strawberry pancakes and bacon, @PERSON1 ordered quiche as well, and @PERSON3 ordered strawberry pancakes and bacon also.  We started talking together more once we all got our food and started eating. We started joking about how the quiche looked like it was served with a frog on top, because the sauce the top part of my moms quiche looked like a frog. Then we were all eating and the waitress walked by @PERSON3 who was sitting at the end of the booth and she farted. He freaked out and put his hood over his head, and since he was wearing his sweatshirt backwards it went over his face.  We all started to finish off our meals and @PERSON3 started talking about magic tricks. Basically there would be a fork and a spoon or a couple knifes under a napkin and he would say ""touch it"" and then @PERSON3 would change the silverware around. @PERSON3 then yelled ""touch it"" throughout the whole restaurant and everybody in the restaurant could hear him. We laughed so hard he was turning bright red of embarrassment.  When we were done we paid the check and left a tip for the waitress. It seemed like almost all of the people were gone from the restaurant because of us. We all said goodbye and then got in our cars and left to go home.

8,"   Laughter is what erases pain, it soothes the sadness a person might feel in their heart, and it can also cause a person to forget why they were mad. I believe that if a person loves to laugh than they can over come any pain especially when you have some one beside you who you know will always be there no matter what kind of past you have.   I knew of only one person that could always make me laugh no matter what. Our arguments never lasted because whenever i would get angry at him he would laugh because apparently it was cute. So he wouldn't take me seriously but I didn't mind because it made @CAPS3 bad moment turn into a moment of cheerfulness. Even though I am not with him anymore he still finds a way to make me laugh.  For example, the other day I had to sing at church again but I thought it was going to be like any other day where they announce my name and I go up there and blow everyone away with my amazing voice. But when I was going over the song I totally forgot the beat and how the song went. It felt as if my stomach flipped inside out so I started to panic. It was to late to turn back because they had already called me up, so there was nothing to do but to go up there and hope the words would come back to me. When the song started I was doing great but there came that line I kept messing up on so I tried ignoring it and just move on to the chorus but that didn't help because by then I didn't know where I was. I felt my knee's start to shake and I felt my face slowly start to burn from the heat of the moment. My first reaction was to stop singing before I embarrass my self even more. So I asked @PERSON1, the guy who was controlling the sound system if he could start it over, and he did. So this time I said to my self I can do it. As the song started up again I began hoping that this time I would remember how it went. The part I couldn't sing came up again and I tried to do the same thing of just going on, but I couldn't. I was so angry at my self that I apologized to the people who were watching me and I shamefully walked off the and went into the hallway. At that moment my mind started to spin with insulting thoughts about how dumb I was for not being able to cooperate and just keep going. I looked down at the ground when I felt a liquid substance slowly run down my over heated cheek. I felt so vulnerable because I lost and let the pain of embarrassment overcome me. I wasn't ready to go back in there but my @CAPS1 named @CAPS2 came out and hugged me. He said to me ""@CAPS3 singer has a moment where they fail and they just have to learn from that and be better the next time"".  He also kept going on and told me that it was better to mess up in front of people I've known for years than in front of some one I've never seen in my life. Once he was done talking to me he went inside and I went into the bathroom. Since no one was there i went into a stall and started to weep. I was thinking about how pathetic I looked so I took a deep breathe cleaned my self up and told my self that I looked ugly when I cry so I should really stop. Those were some very encouraging words because I left the bathroom and decided to go back inside but when I looked up I saw @PERSON2, my ex boyfriend. When he saw my red swollen eyes he hugged me and told me I did great. But I knew he was lying because I did the exact opposite of that. He asked if I wanted to talk about it but I shook my head no. Even then he ignored my request and grabbed my hand as he dragged me along to sit on the bench.   His excuse for me not sounding good was that the disc was scratched so it wasn't my fault but that wasn't possible because even the song sounded better than i did. I kept arguing with him like a stubborn child but who was I kidding. I wasn't going to win this one so I stopped. Through out this process of sadness it slowly turned into a smile I couldn't erase from my face. Its as if his words and smile lured me into laughing and forgetting about what happened. I must say laughing is very important no matter what kind of relationship your in. It can fix even the smallest wounds and bring people one step closer to each other.",36.0,6.0

Laughter brings people together, and in my opinion it's a major key to happiness and being successful in life. without laughter, life would be boring and bland.  My best friend's parents had just recently split up, and it was a really hard time for her. Her mom had lost her job, and not having a father to be there to support her and her mom while going through such a hard time was difficult. She wasn't used to the fact that her parents were not going to be living under the same roof or sleeping in the same bed anymore. She had to get used to going back and forth from her mom's to her dad's. Since my parents have been split up for as long as I can remember, I knew exactly what she was going through. I tried to make her realize that things happen that we do not have any control over, even if we do not want something to happen there is nothing we can do about it to make it how we want it. Everything happens for a reason weather we like it or not. I started hanging out with her more because she seemed like she needed a friend. We laughed and joked. One night we were so tired that we were laughing at every little thing that was happening. We were laughing so hard that her dad was getting mad because we were keeping him up. We decided that we should tape our mouths closed to keep us quiet, but we just ended up making more noise than we were without the tape. Our laughs were muffled because of the tape, but still loud. We ripped the tape off and started to bust out laughing.  I then realized how much of an impact laughter can have on a person, and how much it can change a situation. My best friend who had been sad and depressed, was now laughing and happy. It was like she was a completely different person. She realized that having her parents be split up was not so bad after all.  I told her all the good things about having parents that are split up. Sometimes when your parents split up, you become closer to them, like for me, my dad and I became best friends. Now she will be able to spend more quality time with her parents. Just her and them, without anyone getting in the way.  Laughing and always looking on the brighter side of any given situation makes life so much easier. I asked her the same question my older brother asked me when our parents got a divorce. Would you rather have them be together and constantly fight, or be apart and be happier? Also, when she is smiling and happy, she looks so much better and prettier then when she is just sad, depressed and moping around. Another thing, is that she is more fun to be around when she is able to laugh and have a good time. Laughing can turn any sad day into a good one.",35.0,6.0
8," Laughter is one of the many concepts that we take advantage of in life. When I first think about laughing or laughter it all seems so simple, but the more I think about what laughter truly is the more I realize how significant to everyday life it is. Laughing is described as an expression of delight or amusement, but when the action of laughing and what triggers these things is further examined it just becomes blurred as to what laughing really is. Because at that point the more laughter examined the less meaning the word still maintains.There is a point in every persons life when they come to terms with some sort of idea or concept and its like a light being turned on. Although I am not very old I have some fairly extraordinary stories already.  When I was eleven years old I made many realizations about my life although I wouldn't have chosen the circumstances I don't necessarily regret what happened because they made me who I am today. At the time my younger brothers were two years old and a few months old. We all belong to the same family, but the experiences that we have encountered have affected us very differently. My youngest brother was born with health complications that nearly claimed his life more times than I want to think about. But as a family we were able to persevere.We believed that he was going to get better and with that state of mind and determination we made it through those times. Along the way we learned a lot not only about ourselves but about each other, we learned where each others strengths and weaknesses were.We also learned about what the important things really were in life. We understood that we should cherish each moment that we had because we never knew what was going to happen next. At times we became overly excited about him being able to hold down more food than he had the day before or laughing until we were on the brink of tears because one of his nurses had just told us a joke that made us forget about what was happening for just a moment.  At that point in my life I began to appreciate the smallest things that most people would never remember. Like when my younger brother was first born he had to be on a ventilator and had wires and tubes coming out all over him so when he was finally able to pass a car-seat test that would ensure he could be in a car and keep his respiration's at a normal level for long enough to get home.What might seem insignificant to others meant to us we were one step closer to being able to take him home. Those times have a very significant part not only in how we lived our lives at that point in time but also how we are living now. My little brother went through so much in his life at such an early age and if I could have traded places with him I would in a heart beat, even if that means that I would most likely not be alive today. I am grateful for the fact that he will have no recollection of all the surgeries and pain that he endured at that time of his life but at the same time I know that because of all he did go through that he is one strong little boy.  Now that my little brother is five and in kindergarten a lot of things have changed from when he was born, but what we have gotten out of the whole experience will be with us for the rest of our lives. There are moments that I reflect back onto all of those times and think about how much has truly changed for us since then. Like when my brother begins to laugh so hard he can hardly catch his breath I think back to the very first time that he laughed. That day we got a phone call from his nurse and at first assumed that something was terribly wrong when she said we needed to get to the hospital as soon as we could. When we got to the hospital and up to his room he was pulling on one of the animals on his baby mobile that was hanging down and it would bounce and he would start giggling uncontrollably. Whenever I think that my day couldn't possibly get any worse I sit and think about the times that were the hardest, when it would have been easier to turn away from each other we came together.The times when I was afraid of what would happen to my brother next but was too afraid to ask. Those moments are the ones that help me appreciate what is going good instead of focusing on the negative.I would never wish for my family to relive what happened at that time, but I hope that it continues to influence how grateful we are.",38.0,6.0
8," In @NUM1 grade my life changed in a good way once I met @CAPS1. One day when me and @CAPS1 met, we clicked and are now are best friends. Our relationship is full with laughter, we hangout all the time. We enjoy going to the mall and listening to music. One day, I stayed the night over at her house on the weekends we listened to music while she was doing my hair, after that we had dinner and stayed up really late laughing and telling jokes. We've been friends for @NUM2 years. When me and @CAPS1 went to @CAPS2 in @NUM3 and @NUM4 grade I met @PERSON1 she was in @NUM5 grade when i met her and became best friends forever all through high school. @CAPS1, @LOCATION1, and i are all friends and once in a while we all hangout together we like to and listen to music. I have known @CAPS1, and @PERSON1 for long time and I have such good friends. It's nice to have them in my life because they care alot about me, @CAPS1 care's about me because of my @CAPS3 and so does @LOCATION1. It's comforting to now that they are there for me when I need help or a good friend to laugh with. Laughter is a big part of my friendship with all of my friends we like the part that we all get to hangout together and listen to music.And we like to tell jokes about stuff.This year as been good I went to homecoming and it was so fun, this @DATE1 I'am to snowball with some friends and i can wait.",27.0,4.0
8," Well in this day and age laughter is one of the best things @CAPS7 can experience.@CAPS6 its in a relationship,@CAPS1,or friendship.Laughter should be experienced by everyone everyday,its just a healthy thing. I wish I could say I laughed more,but I don't. @CAPS6 I was a stronger person @CAPS4 would be a more often thing to see me laugh.I myself i let little things get to me,and that's what I'm here to change of the year of @DATE1.I want to go by everyday saying this is gonna be a good day,wake up feeling like I'm a brand new individual.I am just going to try and live life to the fullest this year. So my name is @CAPS2. My life has many obstacles and roller coaster rides in this @NUM1 years.I would like to start out by saying @NUM2 years ago,my parents @CAPS3,with my mom leaving that day and me not seeing her for a while was a heartbreak for me.I was @NUM3 and my brother was @NUM4 in a half.Me and him were very close to each other,playing in the mud,riding bikes and horses at the time,now from the impact of the divorce I barely get to see my brother,and too this day @CAPS4 still breaks my heart.I used to live with my dad for a couple of years before my step mom didn't like me,which that is in shorter terms.Then I lived with my mom for @NUM5 years then more stuff happened there,so now i live with my grandparents.They are there for me throughout very tough things,I am very appreciative of them.I have always wanted my parents to get back together,but now I'm starting to think that @CAPS4 was for the best.@CAPS6 they were still together things would have got @NUM6 times worse.They have both found spouses,and my mom has two more kids,a two year old and a @NUM7 month old now,Which I think that Is one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me in my life.Getting to see my little brother,which is one of the cutest most well behaved little boys, and along with my little @CAPS5 they are the most well behaved little kids I've ever taken care of,just seeing them makes me smile ear to ear.I just wish I could see them more times out of the week,seeing my @NUM8 year old brother a couple times a week then my little @CAPS5 and little brother too,those little kids make me the happiest girl alive. Sure there is other things that have happened in my life but my newest siblings are one of the greatest things lately that has happened to me.I wake up knowing they love me,I wish that I could just be there for them more.I know right now i will always be the best big @CAPS5 any little one could have.I want to be that big @CAPS5 they look up too for the rest of their lives.Which means not doing anything wrong in front of them,or teaching them bad habits.I also wanna teach them whats right,wrong,and maybe a different obstacle they could take to get around a problem.I'm gonna be that big @CAPS5. So all in all I just want everyone to know that @CAPS6 i can be happy through that little problem,then @CAPS7 can too.I have many other problems but I look past those also.I am a semi happy person,I laugh everyday,and @CAPS7 know what @CAPS6 @CAPS7 put yourself down all the time,of course your not gonna be happy.So @CAPS6 your a unhappy person,find and surround yourself with things and people that make @CAPS7 happy.Like little kids for instance,I love helping them and your should too.I told my story and I'm smiling right now while i think of my @CAPS1 and how me and them can still be happy despite the little problems in life.",41.0,7.0

Mr tickle monster would always be handy on those blue days. @CAPS15 father was @CAPS15 inspiration and with that i could always smile and a laugh. I would go fishing with @CAPS15 dad and make fun of him that @CAPS7 looked like fish that @CAPS7 would catch. @CAPS7 would always do the smoochy face and tell @CAPS11 if @CAPS7 could eat @CAPS11 with kisses. @CAPS7 would always make fun of @CAPS11 as well. @CAPS15 @CAPS8 would grab @CAPS15 dolls and and pretend that @CAPS7 was @CAPS11 playing with them. That would always make @CAPS11 mad but happy @CAPS3 @CAPS7 would give @CAPS11 a kiss in @CAPS15 forehead always telling @CAPS11 after ""I am just kidding i love you so much sweetheart"". We would always be together and @CAPS3 @CAPS7 came back @CAPS23 work i would sleep with @CAPS15 dad and @CAPS20 a @CAPS1 nap. @CAPS3 we would wake up i would play with @CAPS15 toys and @CAPS7 would talk to @CAPS15 mom.  On the year that i was gonna turn six, @CAPS15 dad decided to @CAPS20 @PERSON1 and @CAPS11 to @LOCATION3 to finally meet @CAPS15 grandma. This was @CAPS15 first time being alone with @CAPS15 dad. @CAPS15 @CAPS1 brother was only four so it doesn'@CAPS19 count. I was hungry, because of our long ride, so we stopped at @ORGANIZATION2's to eat breakfast. We were stuffed since we ate so much pancakes. So we decided to use a payphone and call @CAPS15 mom all the way to @LOCATION2. since we were in @LOCATION1. @CAPS15 dad made the snort face and started to laugh so we laughed with him and send a air kiss to @CAPS15 mom through the phone. She was crying wishing we were with her.Then we all said our goodbyes and we told @CAPS15 mom we loved her.   we came inside Of the car and we buckled up then we drove off. After a while it was getting hot and i asked @CAPS15 dad if @CAPS7 could @CAPS20 the extra blankets out. @CAPS7 said,   ""@CAPS4 mi amor, estas bien caliente con todos estos sarapes?"" (""@CAPS5 @CAPS15 love, is it to hot with this blankets?"")I said,""@CAPS4 papa tengo mucho calor!"" (yeah dad I am really hot.!) @CAPS7 laughed and gave @CAPS11 a kiss on the cheek, then @CAPS7 grabbed the two blankets. I just stared at him with a smile, then @CAPS7 finally smiled back and close the door. i was watching him @CAPS23 the back seat. @CAPS15 @CAPS1 brother was sleeping.  @CAPS15 dad looking at @CAPS11 smiling putting the blankets in the back of the car trunk. @CAPS3 i look back and then face @CAPS15 dad out of the no were a drunken lady hits @CAPS15 dad and @CAPS7 slams to the cars back window to the ladies front car side and back to the trucks window.

Nobody could hear @CAPS11. I was inside the car and there was no response. i was scared. Paralyzed. Spaced out. Like as if someone threw @CAPS11 a bucket of cold water in @CAPS15 face over and over. I didn'@CAPS19 want to believe it and i thought it was all a dream. But no it wasn'@CAPS19 @CAPS7 was paralyzed @CAPS7 looked pale and blood was coming out of his mouth like venom. All the life joy @CAPS7 had was running out like blood. I could feel in @CAPS15 vibrations that @CAPS15 father, @CAPS15 spider-man, @CAPS15 hero that kept telling @CAPS11 to do good in school was gone for ever. The smile of @CAPS15 face was gone now and for ever. @CAPS15 brother woke up crying and i was paralyzed and out of the no were i tell him that everything is okay @CAPS3 i know that our future is hell for now on. @CAPS7 falls back to sleep with his stuffed animal ratonsito.  Years past and i had a lot of difficulties at school. The @CAPS2 @CAPS23 class would make fun of @CAPS11 because i would wear @CAPS15 dads old shirts.

But i had to admit @CAPS15 life was a living hell. @CAPS15 mom would come @CAPS23 home and school( @ORGANIZATION1). I had nobody to talk to, but myself. Every thing was black and white. @CAPS15 dad was gone and i had to face the fact. @CAPS15 mom became more available and i felt happy about that so much. @CAPS15 mom was @CAPS15 new best friend and with her i can smile and laugh because a mother never leaves her children.

8,"                               Social @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student, at some point in their education, has a class they really hate. Maybe it's the subject, the teacher, the other kids in the calss,or maybe its just simply the time of day @CAPS12 have to take it. No matter the reason, @CAPS2 student has at least one. This story is about mine, and how it changed my life. I have always hated social @CAPS1/history. I was scheduled to take it fifth period in seventh grade. I couldn't find anyone in that class. Plus my eighth grade friends were telling me @CAPS7 a jerk the teacher, @LOCATION2, was. None the less I knew I had to take it all year. So, before ever setting foot in the class I decided I would just make the best of the whole situation. @CAPS7 I didn't know was that one kid in the class would change everything for me. Like everyone else, I showed up on the first day of seventh grade already sick of middle school. I felt like it just wouldn't end. The only class I had really been dreading was social @CAPS1. The first couple days are always boring but, in social @CAPS1 it felt ten times worse. I remember the first day I sat in a random seat and basically just hung out. I watched all the other kids, some doing the same thing as me other paying real close attention. On the second day of class I noticed that @PERSON1 was in the class. We had been friends the year before but had lost contact over the @DATE1. @CAPS4 looked out of place in the class. So, I decided I would start sitting by @CAPS13 and try to be friends again.  As the year went on we became closer and closer, we had tons of fun. It was the kind of fun we as students love but, the teacher don't. We were always laughing,and @CAPS8 quietly. We were always so loud about everything. A couple weeks into our second semester @PERSON2 told us we were going to be working on a project that would count for @PERCENT1 of our final grade. After @CAPS4 was done explaining @CAPS7 was required for the project @CAPS4 told us we could do the project with a one other person. @PERSON1 and I looked straight at each other which, of course, made us laugh. @PERSON2 glared at us. ""@CAPS3, please choose your partner wisely."" @CAPS4 looked at us, ""@CAPS5 that means @CAPS12 as @CAPS11."" ""@CAPS6 @NUM1."" We replied together as if practiced. Despite @CAPS7 @CAPS4 had said we still decided to do the project together. We thought it would be a lot of fun. We had two and a half weeks until we had to present. I can't remember @CAPS7 topic we chose but I do remember that we went to the computer lab for five days to get information. Those five days I think we worked hard. Still finding time to talk about other things. ""@CAPS7 are @CAPS12 up to this weekend @PERSON1?"" I asked on a @DATE2, the last day we were in the lab. ""@CAPS8 really sure yet."" @CAPS4 replied. ""@CAPS10 than likely just hanging around doing nothing."" ""@CAPS11, I'm heading to @LOCATION1 for a basketball tournement. Want me to bring @CAPS12 back something?"" ""@CAPS12 would do that for me?"" @CAPS13 voice became so soft. So I turned away from my computer to look at @CAPS13. @CAPS4 was already looking at me. A smile on @CAPS13 face and @CAPS13 eyes, they seemed so caring. ""Of course I would @CAPS14!"" I finally replied as soft and caring as @CAPS4 had asked. We looked at each other for a second longer then just busted up laughing. We couldn't stop till @PERSON2 came over and put @CAPS13 hands on our shoulders. We stopped so suddenly, it was like @CAPS4 had shot us or something. Then @CAPS4 walked away. Then we finished class working and laughing about the stuff we read. The bell rang and we left. One @CAPS10 period till the weekend. The weekend flew by. My team got another first place. I found lots of time to look for something for @PERSON1. The down part of the weekend was knowing I had to go to school @DATE3 but, it did mean I could give @PERSON1 @CAPS13 gift of shells and a postcard. When I got to fifth period on @DATE3 I gave @CAPS13 the gift. I could tell by the look on @CAPS13 face that @CAPS4 liked them. I felt on top of the world for making @CAPS13, of all people, smile like that. @CAPS3 a days whenever I am felling down or like a loser I think of @CAPS13, or go talk to @CAPS13. That is how I get from a bad day to a great day, by being friends with @PERSON1. If it wasn't fot that class I wouldn't have that. I will always be thankful for that class.",40.0,7.0
8," Someone once said, ""Laughter is the best medicine,"" I agree. Laughter comes in different forms, from the simplest giggle, to a full on, originating from the bottom of your stomach laugh. When someone makes @CAPS3 laugh it brightens up even the worst of days. All through my years of school I have had a group of friends that have stuck with me through everything. Whether it be break ups or bad days, they have always known exactly how to get my smile back. My story begins with a fall of tears yet ends with a bus ride of laughter.  My sophomore year of high school I ran track. I decided i would attempt hurtles. Don't get me wrong, I'm an athletic person, however being only @NUM1 foot it was a challenge. Everyday @CAPS4 practice hurtles were the only thing I would practice. The majority of my friends did track along with me, they were doubtful that I could compete in hurtles @CAPS4 the next meet, however I was determined to overcome all there doubt and succeed. I would push myself harder and harder everyday till I was able to clear them with no problem. @CAPS4 the next meet my name was on the list for hurtles.  Warming up with the hurtles was no problem, I cleared everyone of them with ease. I was so confident that I could win this race with no problem. I had the speed and the accuracy of my hurtles well rehearsed and well plotted out. When I heard them call for my race my stomach knotted. Suddenly my confidence was gone, all I could think about now was falling flat on my face. My worst fear besides falling flat on my face, was hearing that dreaded ""@CAPS1 ouch"" from the crowd. I tried everything I could think of to get my mind off my race, ""its only a hundred meters,"" I kept telling myself, ""run, run, run, jump."" @CAPS2 soon @CAPS2 I heard that starter gun go off I ran my fastest and jumped @CAPS2 high @CAPS2 i could, I had completed all but the last one, I was in second place and all I needed was so lengthen my stride just a little more and I would have this race. The only problem with lengthening my stride was I hadn't planned out how many strides to do until I jumped. Before I knew it I was jumping way after I was supposed to. The next thing I knew I was on the track with blood coming out of my elbows and knees, and tears in my eyes. My only intuition was to get up and run. @CAPS2 I finished the race I ended up in third place, not to bad for my first hurtle race but not @CAPS2 good @CAPS2 the first I would have been in. When i had time to cool down after my race my coach came up to me, I was prepared to hear the worst. With tears still in my eyes I put my pride behind me and went and faced him. ""@CAPS3 did great kid,"" he said @CAPS2 he patted my shoulder. I would have never expected him to say that. When I made my way over to where all my friends were standing and watching, they were all awaiting me with huge smiles on their faces. ""That was the best race I've ever seen!"" announced on of them. ""@CAPS4 least @CAPS3 didn't fall completely on your face, @CAPS3 could be missing teeth right about now!"" said another. My friends and I had a great laugh about how many different ways my race could have gone worse. It made my horribly embarrassing moment so much better. Instead of having one of those awkward silence bus rides home with my team we all had a great time talking about each others races that have gone wrong.  Even though I had one bad race I still do hurtles, I have found that the more I laugh and have a good time with my races the better I do. If I were to just be hard on myself and not have a good time during track season then I probably wouldn't want to participate in that sport anymore. Without laughter and fun there is no motivation to do something even if your good @CAPS4 it. Eventually @CAPS3 will get burnt out. When ever I think of a time when laughter was one element or part I always think of this. It is true, Laughter is the best medicine. ",41.0,7.0
8," It all began when my best guy friend @CAPS9 the time asked @CAPS7 to go to the lake that @DATE1 with a bunch of people , I mean how could I turn that down getting tan with friends, swimming I mean it sounded fun in all so I decided to say yes @CAPS5 really fast too. I was sitting on the couch when all the sudden my phone started ringing I hurried to pick it up.. it was @PERSON2 "" @PERSON1... @PERSON2 said "" ""yeah, whats up "" ""your coming right tomorrow right.. @PERSON2 continued """"yeah, of course what time though.""  ""@CAPS2 going to be @CAPS9 your house @CAPS9 @NUM1 be ready @CAPS2 being @NUM2 exlaimed"" "" alright alright ,ill see you tomorrow.. @CAPS3 I hung up the phone.""  The next day I layed in bed wide awake @CAPS9 @TIME1 @CAPS5 was unable to even think about sleeping any more I was so excited I had that feeling where I just knew it was going to be a good day @CAPS5 knew it was going to be so much fun. Nine o clock came faster @CAPS3 ever, I jumped out of bed @CAPS5 went straight to the bathroom to get ready, @CAPS5 begin packing my beach bag. @CAPS3 finally @NUM1 rolled around, @CAPS5 my phone started going off agin @CAPS5 it was @PERSON2 "" you ready!? were outside your house .. @PERSON2 said"" ""yep, @CAPS2 coming right now..bye "" I got in the car with it jamed full of guys @CAPS5 we took off.   @CAPS9 about two o clock we got to the lake @CAPS5 all began getting out of the car @CAPS5 started stretching @CAPS3 @CAPS3 all the boys started stripping off their clothes until just there swimming shorts @CAPS5 @CAPS3 all started running right towards the water @CAPS5 all hopped in. So right away I began taking my clothes off so now all I had on was my swimsuit @CAPS3 I stared walking down too. Finally @PERSON2 comes up @CAPS5 starts telling @CAPS7 to hurry "" @CAPS1'mon @PERSON1 hurry it up run I want you to get in..."" "" I know @CAPS2 coming.. @CAPS5 @CAPS2 going to get in dont worry @PERSON2.. "" @CAPS3 out of no where @PERSON2 grabes my hand @CAPS5 begins making @CAPS7 run down towards the water. When all the sudden we hit this like muddy patch of walk way area that looked like bird poop @CAPS5 mud mixed together. As soon as my feet hit the mud , while I was running I slipped @CAPS5 fell right in front of the guy I liked @CAPS9 the time ""@PERSON2"". I had never been more embarrassed in life, but I played it out cool, @CAPS5 since everyone else was laughing @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I decided to start laughing too. @CAPS3 I notcied that once everyone had stopped laughing no one really cared enough to make it that big of deal. So I hopped back up with the help of @PERSON2's hand @CAPS5 @CAPS3 notcied that since I had just slipped in mud/poop that it was all over the butt. @CAPS9 that point I dont think I could have been more embarrassed about what had just happened..I had slipped in mud, @CAPS5 it was all over @CAPS7. After that had happen I didnt really care anymore about being embarrassed, so I walked on down to the water @CAPS5 got in right away @CAPS5 swam around a little bit so that the mud would wash away, @CAPS5 thank @CAPS4 it did. About twenty mintues later were all sitting in the sand @CAPS5 just telling stories @CAPS5 hanging out, when @PERSON2 looks over in the water @CAPS5 notices that there is a huge ""water slug"" in the water right by him, so him being a guy, he decides to go over @CAPS5 grab the slug @CAPS5 hold on to it, @CAPS5 of course.. I freak out @CAPS5 get up @CAPS5 kind of take a few steps back. @PERSON2 starts asking "" @CAPS5 who do I want to throgh this @CAPS9"" everyone @CAPS9 the point is saying "" not @CAPS7.. NOT @CAPS7"". I just stood there quit, when he looks over @CAPS9 @CAPS7 I stare back @CAPS9 him with a scared look on my face @CAPS5 say "" @CAPS5 you wouldnt through that @CAPS9 @CAPS7 becauase @CAPS2 a good friend of yours right?.. now would you."" @CAPS9 this point since right before this we were all sitting in the sand talking,I had put on a tank top @CAPS5 shorts over my swin suit, when all the sudden I hear "" @PERSON1 watch out"" I had turned around for a second... @CAPS9 the most, to look @CAPS9 something, @CAPS3 I feel this slimy long wet thing side down my shirt. I look down my shirt @CAPS5 see this slug in side of my shirt. I start freaking out @CAPS5 screaming as loud as I could @CAPS5 jumping around. @CAPS5 just when I thought it was out I look down @CAPS5 its still there finally it comes popping out of my shirt, @CAPS5 I just sat there calming down from what juast happend.

8," Laughter is one of those details in life that you can use, but after a while yes, you will gettried but its fun. Ether you laugh of something funny, or someone with someone ,or at someone ,or just simply at some memories that you have had before that were funny . It is just something you probably do every single day or else you are a very boring person and you don't have any humor in your system. Laughter is very importantbecause  that way you can have happiness in your life as well as your family and your surroundings. I mean just imagine your life with out laughter i think that it would be a pretty boring life.    Now a true story that happened to me. @CAPS6 aside form that the story went like this: I was @NUM1 @CAPS2 old and it was @CAPS1 @CAPS2 my @CAPS4 wanted to go spend @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 with his family, but my mom don't get along with my dads family very well, so he decided to take me. I didn't have a very good relationship with my cousins either. So i told my @CAPS4. ""@CAPS4 can i please stay over here with my moms side of the family not to be rude, but i don't like my cousins over there"" and he said ""that the reason im taking you just because you are not that familiarized with them you haven't treated them so you cant say that you don't like them"". So i was practicably forced to go. I was at the party that they where having and then one of my cousins said ""why are you so grumpy"" and then i said @CAPS10 just ...... i was about to tell her because i don't like you or my other cousins, but i stopped my self then i didn't say anything. she started talking to me. "" @CAPS5 do you want me to tell you a joke ? ""@CAPS6"" yeeeeaah @CAPS6 so there was a class room in were ever and the teacher said @CAPS6 class has started so every one sit down. then she say's stand up if you think you are stupid and @CAPS9 one stand-ed up except for this kid and then she said why do you think you are stupid? @CAPS9 @CAPS9 im not stupid i just didn't want to see you being the only one standing up hahahahahahahah hahahahahah funny laugh you guy's better laugh. @CAPS6 ill laugh so i started to laugh then i realized that she wasn't that bad she was actually really cool and down to earth person and then she introduced me to different people that i didn't even now that they were my cousins, that night was assume after all. See laughter can bring people together @CAPS9 mater how different they are from another, but that joke was pretty funny wasn't it? Any who hears another story im going to tell you. It was a @DATE1 @TIME1 my friends and i are going to school. When we got there everyone was tired too."" just like us and well the teacher didn't look that tired because teachers are always smiling and well just very up beat people except for the mean teachers"". So then we all sat down , and listened to the teacher talk ,and talk about who now's what. Then a girl witch is my friend too went to the sharpener, was sharpening her picle when she let it go and the pincle dropped to the grownd. She decided to pick it up from the grown-ed likewise while she bent bown we all herd this riping sound. I guess someones pants are on to tight thus her getting up real fast and just funning to the bathroom evyone was laughing so hard that i think some people were about to pee. It was very funny for us but for her i must of been very emberising i felt really bad for her that moment. even the teacher was laughing i remember it like it was yesterday. ""@CAPS10 wait it was yesterday""."" jk it was when we were all in @NUM2 great!"" @CAPS11 all of this. After all the laghs that we've had. Don t you think its fun? i think it is i mean far away from now don't you want your kid's to have fun, put some smiles on there faces. To do that you have to laugh with them too. you have to create memories to share as well as them too. however laughing is a good thing maybe i even made some of you kagh while reading this paper.trust me laughing will make you life way easier to handle when you have some fun once in a while right.

8," Laughter is the most importand thing in any relationship. When I say relationship I don't mean boyfriend and girlfriend I mean the relationship you have between friends and family it could also be you'r romantic one as well. My point is laughter creates a place or a world for a short period of time where everything is engalped in happyness. And because of that you are always taken back to your happy memories. And with fun memories comes wonderfull storys. This story is about family camp. If you don't know what family camp it it's elevin familys that get to gether and spend one crazy weekend out in the woods. There is a list that is passed out so every one knows what to brin in supplys plus whatever they want for them selvs. Also you are responsibel for you'r own boat to get acroos the river to the woods where we camp. the camp grounds are an amazing sight to behold. Our campfire is huge more like a bondfire but it has to be inorder to for everyone to keep warm. Tents are scatterd across the area leaving room for all the trails. We also have a kitchen composed of six canipy's. They are set up to make a roof and tabels are pushed together for the propaine tanks and @CAPS1 pits along with the portabel stove tops. But nothing beats the vew. Just the sound of the flowing river and each rapid coliding into eachother pushing agenst the river bank. It's simmilar to the ocean. The clear blue watter along with orange collors of the sun just tuching the eges of the river. It's something i'v longed to paint. But with elevin familys and all there little rugrats running around it can be difficult to find some quiet time.  After setting up camp I pull out hoolahoops, cones, horse shoes, anything i can make an activity out of. Rounding up all the children convince them to to play in my randome contest. Like hoolahooping while ballencing an egg on a spoon. We play my randome games untell the kids are whoren out. Then I hand out prize's every one gets a prize because the prizes are always some form of candy. Sortly after the children consome the candy the are all hyper. Running around climbing swimming anything they can do. It usally gets dark around seven, by eaght the kids are exsahted and are now in bed the only night they go to bed early. Giving the adults and teens some time to wind down. Family camp is exciting, strenuous, complicated, intoxicating, delightfull, exstrodanary and above all fun. Every day at family camp you laught you smile and you enjoy yourself along with people around you. Even tho it takes so much effert to get out there and consumes a lot of time there is nothing i'd rather do than go to family cam. Because one crazy fun wild weekend of laughter equils a life time of memories to be enjoyed.",35.0,6.0
8,"  Fall began early, @CAPS6 was in full swing and the crispy, red stained leaves of @DATE2 fluttered to the pavement at the beginning of @DATE1. In my tired blue jeans I strode up the steps of the @ORGANIZATION1, crunching fallen leaves under my tattered @ORGANIZATION2 sneakers. With slight hesitation, I volunteered to chat with patients who don't have many family near by and for some, the most contact they receive all year is a quick call on @CAPS1. Never having met me before, they would still be thrilled to see me. Leading me, the stout receptionist, showed me down a carpet hall. Porcelain vases of fake tulips placed on antique tables lined the wallpapered walls, attempting to create a feeling similar to home. We stopped at a cheery yellow door on the right side of the hall, room #@NUM1.   Before we could knock, the door flung open with more might than I would have expected from the frail women who stood behind @CAPS6. Easily nearing her mid nineties, the @CAPS2-@CAPS3 women had tired eyes and leathery skin, her face showed her aged and wisdom before she spoke.   ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 there darling, I'm @PERSON2, and whom might you be?"" her eyes wide, she spoke with a thick southern accent.   ""@CAPS5, I'm @PERSON1,"" I extended my hand, ""@CAPS6's nice to meet to you, @PERSON2.""   @CAPS7 with elderly people isn't what I look forward to when I plan my day, especially when they aren't related to me. Different ages, life styles, pasts, and even races, stood between @PERSON2 and I. In my mind I couldn't prevent a wall from being built between us, I anticipated that our conversation would not conquer @CAPS6. I felt the dread developing on my shoulders, muttering to myself about @CAPS8 I only had to survive for the next hour and a half. @PERSON2 and I squeezed onto a narrow, yellow, tweed sofa. Across the open living room a constant hum of an outdated television added to our awkward silence. I broke @CAPS6 first, ""@CAPS8 long have you lived here?"" The silence was thick, tension pushing back on my tongue as I spoke.   That quick nervous question I stuttered, rippled into a much longer and deep conversation. @PERSON2 shared stories about everything, previous patients, terrible nurses, as @CAPS4 as the terrible pranks she has played on nurses. In between my gasps for breath, I could barely spit out another question, that only triggered another hilarious tale that @PERSON2 told so perfectly. @PERSON2's voice carried a story like none I had heard before, for such a small women her life seemed adventurous and eventful. Her stories were endless, and so was our laughter. Besides the ache in my side from my nonstop state of hysterics, I couldn't of been better. Our differences were like sugar in hot tea, dissolving before we noticed they were there. Stereotypes of race and culture that I placed between us, were whisked away and we were sewn together by our laughter. Traveling around the world to different and diverse countries you will find a variety of lifestyles, beliefs, and languages; you'll see @CAPS8 cultures change from one society to another. One of the few things that remains in all parts of the world is laughter. No matter where you search, @CAPS6 can be found, from children playing in the suburbs, to a small mud hut across the world. @CAPS6's a language that everyone speaks, @CAPS6's not exclusive and @CAPS6 doesn't discriminate, and @CAPS6's free.  Cherishing our time together, the conclusion of our afternoon grew near. If you hadn't of known, you would probably think @PERSON2 and I had been friends for years. The way we got along easily, and our conversation that flowed freely, made our relationship appear nurtured over time but laughter brought us that same feeling in only hours. Through her age and experience she connected with me through laughter and story telling. Learning so much about her life, past, family and even at her age of @NUM2, her hope for the future, I felt as though I had known @PERSON2 far longer than just a few hours. The quality of humor is one that both of us share, @CAPS6 makes @CAPS6 easy to talk to people, and makes every activity we're doing enjoyable.  Our pleasant visit ended as I walked @PERSON2 back to her room. Pausing as we approached her door, I gave her a big hug and she cracked a joke about the way she used to hug her granddaughter, yet again sending me into a burst of giggles. I assured her that I'd be back to visit, enjoy a few more laughs and maybe a cup of tea if we could manage through all of our excitement. Leaving the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I thought about the time I had experienced with someone who was a stranger when I woke up that morning, puzzled by @CAPS8 quickly laughter brings people together. @PERSON2's last words echoed through my ears, ""just like my granddaughter,"" realizing that my volunteering experience had given me a friend, and to @PERSON2, a granddaughter.",40.0,7.0
8," Laughter, what would me and my friends do without it. we probably wouldn't be friends and I don't know what I would do without her. We have been best friends since preschool. @PERSON1, she is the one person I can count on in the world to turn my frown upside down. She knows I would do the same for her so it always works out. There have been many times of laughter with her there's the everyday stupid things we do and the odd things that other people do that we laugh at. But most of the time its just us. There was one time where I was at @LOCATION1's house and we got in a huge fight over something so small I don't even remember what it was. She pulled my hair so I pulled hers then she hit me so I hit her. But somehow in the end we ended up just laughing at each other while we were pulling each others hair and hitting each other. That's how best friends are. I remember @NUM1 grade it was about the middle of the year. @PERSON1 and I started to be getting into some trouble of our own between grades and boys. But we didn't care we loved the way we were and weren't going to change for anyone. @PERSON1 and I started to date some guys that were best friends to. They were just like us trouble. We loved it they were just what we had always wanted. They were bad boys. They made us laugh and brought me and @PERSON1 even closer together. All we could do when we were together was smile and talk about the boys. Until the days that we found out they cheated on us. @PERSON1 and I were devastated. I stayed at her house that night and we just cried and cried until we started burning all the pictures and all the notes and started smiling again. That night we started talking about the old times when we weren't such trouble makers but just care free kids with no care in the world about boys just me and her against the world. That's what the plan always was even if we got married or moved away from each other we would always be close. We laughed and laughed about the old times when we would fake yell and scream at each other just to get attention just because we loved it. We talked about how our lives were great until boys came along and how we were so perfect just the way we were.  Laughter has always brought @PERSON1 and I so close even in the worst of fights like when our boyfriends got us into a fight. It was the worst fight we could have ever possibly gotten into. We both said things that weren't true and turned friends against each other which was horrible. But when we found out our boyfriends cheated on us we talked it out for a while and resolved things. All we do now is just laugh there is nothing in the world that can bring us down we are free spirited young ladles and we love each other just the way we are no questions asked. If someone made me pick them or @PERSON1 I would pick her in a flash and she would do the same for me. I do not have just one story where laughter was the element of the story all of them have laughter as the main element and I don't have just one that sticks out because they all do.",36.0,6.0
8," I feel that laughter is a huge part in living. It is always good to laugh. You are suppose to laugh. Life is suppose to fun. Sometimes you have to be serious about life and sometimes you can have fun with life.  Personally, I laugh way to much. I have to much fun at school. Instead of being serious about school I mess around way to much. But sometimes at school i am serious about it. I mostly mess around when i am in a group with my friends. Laughing kind of helps when you go to a funeral. It only helps if your crying and try and think of something funny. So you don't think of the person who passed away. That's at least what I try and do when I go to a funeral. It sucks when somebody passes away but you have to move on with life. Laughter was a good part in my life when my grandma passed away. Because I was only @NUM1. And of course i cried for ever but then i moved on with life. But my @CAPS1 was trying to make me laugh by saying funny things. It helped but not for very long. Did it yes only for a very little bit. ",26.0,4.0
8,"It was a starry night at @DATE1 camp in @DATE3. Someone said something funny that made me laugh so hard my side hurt. The next day I was out of wack and really happy because I slept good. I was also in a good mood because I got to do the high ropes course it was a lot of fun I even went down the zipline. It was a tiring day for me and my cabin members. We all were happy after we had dinner and dessert, we all went to the campfire later that evening and roasted marshmallows I had at least thirty marshmallows that night. I tried to keep the extra canteen money but my @CAPS1 said ""Is that my change?"". And I said ""@CAPS2!"". That was the end of me trying to keep the extra money. Meanwhile I started unpacking after the tiring bus ride home from camp. After camp I went to my grandmas for the @DATE1 where I had the best time ever. Then I returned home and on @DATE2 I registered for school again. Of course I was tired from getting my school picture taken. I had the most funny @DATE1 of all.",27.0,4.0
8," Live. Laugh. Love. All three of those words hold great meaning and importance. Some people say ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" People all around the world are laughing, somebody is laughing every second of everyday. Many people believe that laughter is a very important part of any relationship. To me, laughing is a type of happiness and it's always good to have that kind of happiness. There are many ways to make people laugh, for example: jokes or stories. There are also many people who can make you laugh, anyone can fit the description. Such as a mom, a dad, siblings, extended family like aunts, uncles, cousins, teachers, and of course any type of friends. All the people listed have made me laugh at some point in life. Babies, pets, and people on television also make me laugh. It's always good in life to have that certain someone who will always be there to make you laugh. If someone told me to pick one person in my life who has always made me laugh it would be very hard to choose because so many people make me laugh so I wouldn't be able to choose just one person; however, my parents would be high up on the list. Brent @PERSON2, my dad always has the best jokes and stories to tell. He always tells them at the perfect time. His jokes range from redneck jokes, blond jokes to yo momma jokes and more. He also always has a good story to tell me about when he was my age. All the trouble he caused in the small town where he lived located in @LOCATION1, those stories always get me laughing. Hes got good jokes about and sayings about farts too. Those ones are my favorite because they are the funniest. I always laugh until it hurts. @PERSON2, my mom also always has something funny to say just like my dad, my mom has very many jokes. I'm glad I have parents that make me laugh and I look up to them for that, along with many other things.  Like I stated earlier, many people can make me laugh. My best friend @PERSON1 would definitely be high up on the list too. @PERSON1 and I have been best friends for almost six years now. It all started in the seventh grade. Middle school was great and now here we are juniors in high school. We will be best friends forever. We are inseparable. Its kind of like we're connected at the hip, we do everything together. @PERSON1 and I have uncountable memories most in which we have pretty much died on the floor laughing. We make each other laugh all the time, it could be about anything too. Together we can make any situation funny wherever we are. We think so much alike, if people knew they would probably think it's weird. Because we think a lot a like we think a lot of the same stuff is funny, even when other people don't think it is. We just laugh. Not only is it important to laugh at whats funny but you also need to laugh sometimes when its not so funny. I know that sounds a bit ridiculous but what I mean is, say your watching a baby and they don't quite know how to walk yet. Chances are they are going to fall down a couple of times and they @MONTH1 bonk there head or something, well if it's not to serious then just laugh about it to keep the baby from crying. Another example is if you or someone you know gets picked on by friends if it doesn't hurt there feelings then it's something you all can laugh about, you just need to know how to take a joke if its not hurtful or mean. As you can tell laughing is very important in life. There are many ways to laugh and many things to laugh at, so go ahead, don't hold back, and just laugh when its necessary to do so. Laugh as much as you breath. ",38.0,6.0
8," A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 time that laughter helped my friend and I. One day we were having a good time and we were out at our local laser tag outlet. We had been playing for a couple of hours and it was like @NUM1 so we decided to go home and hang out at his house. So we were walking back to his house and we got there around @NUM2. So we went inside and played some video games. Then I looked at the time saw that it was @NUM3. So I tell him that I have to go. So I hurry out the door and run to my house which was about seven blocks away. I get to my house and then I go inside and my mom says why are you late and said I lost track of time. She asked why I lost track of time and I say that we were playing video games. Then my mom said next time look at the clock more often than that so I said ok I will. So the next day I go over to my friends house and see that he is looking for something so I say dude what are looking for? He said I lost my emblem and I said what is that? He said it was his grandfathers army emblem that his grandfather gave to him and that it was very important to him. So I said where did you leave it the last time you saw the emblem? He said on my dresser. So I said did look behind the dresser, on the floor, under your bed. He said yes and looked away. Then he paused and turned to look at me. Said did you take it so I said no way. Then he said to me in a aggressive voice are you sure about that. Then I said yeah why would I take it isn't mine to take. Then he said I don't know why you would take it but you were the only one in my room yesterday. Then we started arguing some more and then wee both were quiet for a minute or two. Then we started to look some we couldn't find it in his room so we went to the rest of his house. By then we were very mad at each other and could hardly be around each other. So we search the rest of the house but it could not be found. So then we went to the laser tag outlet and asked the manager if we could look for it in the arena. He said that we could so we looked in every nook and cranny of the arena. We couldn't find it there either. We went back to his house to re-check every thing . When we got there we went though every thing and still couldn't find it. We started to think that we would never find it ever. Then we went in his kitchen to have lunch. Then I saw some thing on his neck and ask him what was on his neck. He said that there was nothing around my neck and he stopped. Then he reached back to his neck took off the thing we were looking for and around neck was the emblem. He took it off and we both stared it for a minute. Then at the last minute we both started to laugh. Then he apologized to for thinking that I took it in first place. I just said that everything is okay. So after that he put the emblem on and then we went to go hang out at the school playground for the rest of the day.",32.0,5.0

Laughing for me is like a drug, once I start I don't want to stop, but it does so i do it some more. If it feels good, well then why stop.        I remember a time in my life were everything was gray and i just hated the world, but not the people in it @CAPS1 i would laugh and have a good time, but at the end of the day i was melodically. Until my best friend, witch i haven't talked to or been around with and just haven't really been a friend to him, told me a joke that turned me right around.        From that monument on i was a changed man. I saw colors again, I loved the world and all the things in it again, i was the good in people, i got back with my @CAPS2., and for the first time scene i don't remember when i felt like my self again. All the days seem to blend into one great day, i couldn't tell you how truly happy i am aging. And now my best friend and i are now closer then ever before.       What I'm really trying to say is that don't give up on yourself just because your going threw some heavy stuff right now. Talk to someone who will just listen and not give their two sense in. hung out with people that truly care about you.

8,"Just @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @DATE1 is @LOCATION2's @CAPS2. This year she turned fifteen. It is a tradition to go to the @CAPS2 girl's house. Before we went to her apartment building, we thought we should stop by @ORGANIZATION1 and get her a gift.  I was with @PERSON2, @PERSON5 and @PERSON3 when I got the brilliant idea of getting her a chew toy. It is also tradition to get her the randomest present you can think of. So we went to the doggie section and got her a duck that quacked. We put the duck in a cup that had a friendship quote written on it. We all thought it was really funny and almost peed ourselves in the isle. Luckily, none of the workers were there to yell at us. When we got to her house we gave her the duck. We all burst out laughing, yet again, when she couldn't figure out how to make it quack. @CAPS8 a dog was smarter than her. @PERSON1 was already at her house when we arrived. We were united and ready to be loud, annoying, and very crazy.  After a while, we got tired of sitting around doing nothing. Then, @CAPS1 brilliant idea hit me. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 was only about a ten minute walk from her building. On our way there, we stopped at the gas station for some monsters. @PERSON2 found cat food and suggested we buy it for @PERSON4. Again, we laughed and I was afraid that we would get kicked out, as we have before. @PERSON3 and I decided it was best to wait outside before we got even louder. After a few minutes they came out with arms full of monsters.We all know that monsters make us entirely too hyper and we are three times as loud. So I decided not to drink mine and give it to @LOCATION3; someone had to stay sane and keep everybody else out of trouble.  We were finally at @LOCATION1. Immediately, we started playing on the swings and the little jungle gym. It was a miracle that we all fit since it was made for kids under ten years old. @PERSON1 and I stayed behind to take pictures of this crazy day. When @PERSON5 fell down while trying to climb up the slide, we couldn't hold it in. But thank god no one was around to hear our roaring sounds of laughter. The girls and I got really bored after exploring the @LOCATION1. We decided to head to @CAPS3 and buy @PERSON4 a cake. The lady asked if we wanted anything written on it. Since it was at no extra cost, we decided to put ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6"". For some reason the lady had a really hard time spelling her name and we thought it was hilarious. But then again, after a few rounds of monsters, we think everything is hilarious. We kept asking her random question, such as, ""@CAPS7 you have to go to a special school to learn how to write names in frosting all professional?"" @CAPS8, you did have to take special classes. We thought it was amazing and laughed. I think the lady was getting a little scared. We have that effect on some people who aren't used to us. Once we got to her house, @PERSON3 started getting a really bad stomach ache. She rolled around on the floor, moaning as if she were in labor. @PERSON2 thought this was the funniest thing she had ever witnessed. We have an echo effect on each other. When one of us laughs, someone else joins. Hearing @PERSON2 laugh caused me to start laughing. I made a donkey noise which trigged @PERSON1. Hearing @PERSON1's goofy laugh made @PERSON4 chime in. Then we heard a squeaky mouse noise and knew it was @PERSON3. @PERSON5 was last to join, no one can hold in their laughter after listening to @LOCATION4.  We all laughed for about ten minutes straight. When things were finally calming down, I snorted really loud and we all started cracking up again. @PERSON4's parents weren't home to listen to our loudness so we didn't get in trouble. Luckily, @PERSON4's neighbors were really gracious to us and didn't complain.  I'll never forget that day. I'll never forget any @CAPS2 we had together. I'll never forget any moment we had.

8,"Dad's @CAPS1 In the not so distant past I needed to buy my father a birthday gift. The usual cologne and tie were too frequently his gift, so I decided to go into the uncharted waters of @CAPS2 and get him an amazing gift. I walked into the store, with red and white isles, with @PERSON2 my older sister and @PERSON1 my younger brother. We all had the same goal, but different results, to get our father a gift @CAPS3 would love. The search then began. After much time considering @CAPS5 to get my father @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 bought him new socks and I bought him a @CAPS1 that held batteries and could even vibrate, for a closer shave. Little did I know that @CAPS1 would change the lives of my brother and I, and this is where the adventure truly begins. Several days after I had given my father the @CAPS1 as his birthday present, I saw it next to the sink glinting in the light. @PERSON1 and I were brushing our teeth as usual after our lunch. I know your recommended to brush after meals by the dentist, but no one ever really does. I wanted to be a pediatric dentist when I grew up so I made sure my brother and I brushed our teeth. @PERSON1 was spitting blobs of white foam into the sink and I made it a course of action to make mine bigger than his. This was a competition I had seen on a movie many years before and it made my eight year old brother brush more thoroughly. I was almost ready to rinse when the @CAPS1 caught my eye. My brother had begun to rinse his green toothbrush. I played with the button that turned the vibrate on and off. I demonstrated the function to @PERSON1. My gift was definitely better than his, but @PERSON1 seemed to disagree.  Then out of a pure joking tone I whispered, ""I dare you to shave your eyebrow off.""  @CAPS3 smiled and showed his infamous dimples, the same dimples @CAPS3 had shown when @CAPS3 first learned to tie his shoes and ride his bike without training wheels. I loved my brother and I didn't think @CAPS3 would ever attempt such an impulsive stunt. @CAPS3 grabbed the @CAPS1 and turned the vibrate button on, then just as it was above his eyebrow @CAPS3 quickly turned the vibration off and slid the @CAPS1 down his eyebrow. His eyebrow had disappeared in the blink of an eye, and my jaw dropped to the recently re-tiled floor. My brother stared at the mirror in shock, his deep brown eyes almost out of their sockets.  Was my brother a fool? @CAPS5 had @CAPS3 just done? The answers came just as soon as the questions had. My brother didn't know that the @CAPS1 would shave when its vibrate button was off. @CAPS3 had thought it only shaved when the vibrate was on. I began to smile uncontrollably and laughter started to roll out of my mouth and into the air. @PERSON1 had shaved half an eyebrow off! @CAPS3 stared at me with anger marked by the wrinkles on his forehead.  ""@CAPS4't tell mom,"" was all @CAPS3 could say. @PERSON1 knew that as soon as our mom knew @CAPS3 would be lectured for sure. @CAPS3 went the day without eye contact from others, for fear they would notice the missing eyebrow. To me this was hilarious and a story I would preserve in my memory for my future family. All the work my brother was doing to hide this secret wouldn't last for long. Someone would have to notice, and it was the last person @CAPS3 desired to have know. My mother came home and began to cook dinner. We set the table and I couldn't stop staring at @PERSON1's nonexistent eyebrow, I began to giggle and @CAPS3 started too also! Then it turned into a roaring laughter. My mothers attention immediately was directed toward us. I couldn't talk. As soon as I sucked in enough air she asked @CAPS5 was going on that she didn't know. I told her the truth, and @PERSON1 looked down at his palms. I ran out of the kitchen holding onto my stomach, and into the living room where I could hear my mother. ""@CAPS5 were you thinking! You know better than to take a dare..."" I could hear the words floating away from the kitchen and into my ears. The lecture went on for several minutes until my mom noticed the steaming red rice on the stove top. I came back in when I thought things had cleared. We sat and ate our dinner in silence, and didn't mention my brothers nonexistent eyebrow.  To this day this profound story makes my brother and I laugh. We can look back on it and appreciate the cleverness of how everything it seems was almost planned out. @PERSON1 has avoided razors near him in the bathroom and now brushes his teeth alone as to resist temptation that could cause humiliation. For me, this day will never be forgotten.",41.0,7.0
8," It's that amazing feeling in your core, where you feel like you just did two hundred sit-ups. When it sounds like your crying out of control, but you know it's joy. It's laughter.

To begin with, @CAPS3 bpards the airplane with a pillow sack to use as a carrie-on because @CAPS3 lacked a proper handbag or suitcase. @CAPS3 had all of her bellongings there, alonmg with two wallets because her mom knew @CAPS3 would lose it, so why not send two?, (@CAPS3 lost her wallet). Upon our arrival at the airport in @LOCATION4, @CAPS3 asked, ""@CAPS4 we in @LOCATION5 yet"", confusing it with the small @ORGANIZATION1 town. Before you know it @CAPS3 had lost her phone which later had to be mailed at her home in @LOCATION3. This is just the first day. One story that sticks in my head is how @CAPS3 was one day wearing a dress on the bus, and drinking an orange soda. SOmehow @CAPS3 managed to spill akk of her drink on her dress, and what does @CAPS3 do? Well, @CAPS3 grabed a bottle of water, and poured it all over herself, as we all watched and wondered why would @CAPS3 do that.",32.0,5.0
8," @PERSON1 sits at a table, working on an art project, as she simultaneously laughs while telling her friends a story of her youth. Being one of her friends, I laugh with her, although not finding her words humorous. Our laughter fills the room with life, and connects our weeping hearts. Laughter gives us an action to do when nothing can be said, it is an important factor to our relationships and it hides who we really are.  Laughter gives us an action to do when nothing can be said. @PERSON1 continues to laugh because of her once existing innocence, something she knows she will never have again. We laugh some more, laughter being the shortest distance between us, laughter making our group appear as a small flame in a sea of ashen night. We all have stories, it only matters how you choose to present it, or if you choose to re-shape it within your mind. Although chuckling with @PERSON1, the rest of the group and I do not find the moments of @PERSON1's childhood especially funny, therefore, because nothing is to be said- we merely laugh. In moments such as these, I recall a time when I had to use laughter as an action although I did not find anything especially funny.  During the prime of my youth, there was a time I had to use laughter when nothing could be said. I remember it now, I was only four years old, the time when my parents were undergoing a divorce. During this time, my father would lock me and mt siblings in our room in a fit of rage, and my sister would softly cry. Being only four years of age, I had to laugh- for nothing else could be said. I had to laugh to comfort my sister, I had to do so, so that my family might stay together. Although thus melancholy, laughter can also be an effective way to connect ourselves emotionally to the people in which we care for.  Laughter is a necessary contributing factor to our relationships. @PERSON1, other friends and me laugh as on person, merging our spirits whole. With our laughter we feel in a confirmed sense that we are friends, but do we really know each other? only time can answer. Feeling connected with my friends, I remember a particular moment when I felt connected with someone truly special to me, and how our laughter contributed to our relationship.  When it comes to laughter connecting people, I have had quite an experience concerning this through my life. It had been a while since our father had locked us in our room, and we could hear the endless conflict occurring between our parents upstairs. It was obvious that my father had been drinking, but i did not know of such things at the time. With my laughter, brought upon by my sister's giggles and together we laughed our pain away, for through my lies of happiness, we both hid how we really felt.  Laughter hides who we really are. While @PERSON1 concludes her story, she looks at me and smiles. This actions is quickly followed by a fit of laughter, emitted from every person at the table except for me. I stare softly into @PERSON2's eyes, and I see the pain in them. She has been been through a lot, with her parents and her boyfriend, I don't understand how she managed to survive, much less live life and laugh. I remember the moments in my life when I used laughter to cover up my pain, breathing the memories through my skin, I realize that it is time to let go of the four-year-old boy locked in the room with his sister. While seeing @PERSON1 pain I recall a @CAPS2 named @PERSON3, or ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"". She is sitting at the table with us and chuckling madly as normal. I wish I knew her more, Is there noting to be said? Maybe she is trying to establish better relations with us? Or is she covering her true @CAPS3? can there a possibility she is truly laughing from the heart? only time can answer. While I gaze with wonder at this beautiful @CAPS2, she forces a grin back at me, throws her head up, and laughs.  Laughter gives us an action to do when nothing can be said, it is an important factor to our relationships, and hides who we really are. While laughter is an important contributing factor to our relationships, it can prevent us from fully understanding each other. In light of this, it is possible to conclude that people rarely laugh through the heart, not truthfully expressing who they are. However, if we hide ourselves through our laughter and do not express ourselves truly by the action, then who are we? ",41.0,7.0
8,"   Have you ever been furious enough to cry ? How about sad? Have you ever felt like the light that surrounded you is turning off leaving you in the dark, cold, foggy waters of a waste land? Have you ever lost all hope and just cried? Well why cry when you can laugh at life? Laughing can cure your heart from any negativity. Laughing is another natural way to release stress and brighten your mood. Laughing can bring two people closer to each other than words because when you laugh, @CAPS1 is an unconsciousness way of bonding. I remember when I once experienced the ability to bond with another person just by laughing.   I was in middle school and @CAPS1 was our last class of the day, @CAPS3 @CAPS4. I knew no one in that class so I sat there in my desk while the rest of my classmates came in. Then two girls came and sat next to my seat and started to talk to each other. I could tell they were friends and they seemed very nice. I asked them a question and while I asked the question I used some of that humor that all my friends said I had. The two girls started laughing and I smiled at them. We soon became friends but we weren't close friends just classmate friends. I wanted to get to know them better so I kept on joking around like I always did around my friends. Soon we started to become closer and closer to each other and for every @CAPS3 study project we had, us three were always partners. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 did get very boring and all we three wanted to do was laugh and talk. Our teacher was a nice man and we wouldn't get in trouble all the time but there was those occasions where he would tell us to be quiet. We three were hard workers and each day we learned a little bit about each other. One day, I noticed a distance growing between our friendship. We had an important @CAPS3 @CAPS4 speech coming up and we had to present our timed speech to the whole class. Those two weeks the three of us rarely talked, in fact all we quite did was smile at each other and keep on working on our speeches. I didn't like the distance building on us because I still wanted to be their friend and I didn't want to be alone again. I realized that my only chance of talking to them was on the day of the presentations. I came up with a plan and I was determined to proceed with my plan on the day of the presentations. When the day of the speech presentations arrived I sat next to them. I started to talk to them as if nothing had ever happened. They were being positive and our conversation was going smoothly. Then our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher came in the class and told us that we had to be quiet and pay attention to all of our classmates speeches. When the first speech started both of my friends were paying attention, as well as I was, but for some reason my friend who was siting in front of me turned around and started to laugh. I automatically hushed her and she placed her head down on the table. I could see how her whole body was shaking and her head was bobbing up and down. This caused me to have an explosion of laughter and soon I was bobbing my head up and down too. We couldn't stop laughing because when ever she placed her head down to laugh I would look at her and start laughing, which would cause me to place my head down laughing and she would look at me. @CAPS1 was a laughter marathon and our stomach's ached and tears rolled down our red faces. We both wanted to stop laughing because we didn't want to get in trouble but there was no way of stopping because we would look at each other and see how we would shake when we laughed. we also felt like we were disrespecting our classmates but the teacher saw that we just couldn't stop laughing and didn't say anything. I asked myself how much longer would I have to laugh?  As soon as everyone presented their speech and the bell rang, my other friend asked my laughing friend and me what was wrong with us. My laughing friend and I looked at each other and kept on laughing. There was no words to describe how we bonded during our @NUM1 minute laughing attack. We had walked in the classroom being classmates and walked out of the class being good friends again. @CAPS1 relieved all the tension our friendship was building and replaced @CAPS1 with a good memory. Now when ever I feel like distances are building up I remind myself that @CAPS5 all @CAPS1 takes is a little laughing to fix and fill all those small gaps in friendships.",38.0,6.0
8," Once when I was on my way over to my best friend @PERSON1's house, she called me and said that I wont be the only one over there hanging out that day. She said her friend ,@CAPS1, had surprised her by showing up unexpectedly at her house. I wasn't going to leave and be rude, so I still proceeded on going over and enjoying some girl time. The drive was about an hour long and I had fallen asleep in the car while my mother was driving next to me. The car had come to a complete stop and the rumbling under the hood had awaken me from my slumber. As my eyes began to opened I realized I've arrived at my destination. I noticed an unfamiliar car that was parked in the drive way, I assumed her friend was older and it was hers. It was a black @ORGANIZATION1 with tinted windows and seemed rather expensive. I opened the door, took a step and my mother was already with my belongings. We were trotting down @PERSON1's gray, swirled, paved walking path talking about when she would come get me tomorrow. I couldn't help but to notice that the grass was so green and freshly cut while the wind was making the trees dance. A grin took over my face as @PERSON1 bolted out of the front door and we tumbled in to the yard. I was so extremely happy to be back with her. My mother said hello to @LOCATION1@NUM1's mom, and left for the evening. @PERSON1 and I ran up her stairs while packing my stuff up like mules, we were out of breath by the time we got to the top. Everything was going just how i thought it would be, this was until we got into her room. @CAPS1 was laying on @PERSON1's bed as we entered, her face was the only thing that moved. This sassy smile crossed her face and her eye balls were lost in her head from rolling back to far. All of a sudden i felt awkward and didn't know how well I was going to fit in. They were watching a reality television show that I was not aware of and never heard of before. Jumping up asking to go make some food they looked at me and said, ""you know where the kitchen is."" I never felt that low in her house before, I don't know why it effected me the way it did, but I felt as if I were in my own home, alone with no one to talk to. So I ran down the mile long flight of stairs and made up some juice and brought it up stair to share with everyone. @CAPS1 snapped at me, for that wasn't the kind of juice she liked, @PERSON1 didn't even budge just laughed, I put on a fake smile; said ""sorry."" I put the jug down and didn't know how to act after that. Her mother came up in the room and informed us that dinner was ready and we should all go wash up. @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 were excited to go eat but I felt like a troll, slump and sad. This was not how I was expecting things to be. While we were in the bathroom @CAPS1 was joking around with me and I was shocked, I didn't know how to respond. A low deep chuckle exited my mouth and everyone began to laugh with me and at me all at the same time. It was quite weird how the ice was broken in the bathroom ,but now I feel more comfortable around them. We made a bet who ever gets to the table first doesn't have to do the dishes. Bolting down stairs for the first seat at the table, @CAPS1 slipped on the floor and tears rolled down my face as if I were crying in pain. But it wasn't pain, it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. She got up and @PERSON1 beat us all to the dinner table first. @CAPS1 and I got stuck doing the dishes for the night, while @PERSON1 just watched and laughed. We were laughing about how she fell; @CAPS1 and I really began to bond.  The night became more exciting with more things to laugh about and things to do. I'm glad the awkwardness vanished and we all are getting along bonding as friends, making fun of each other along the way. This is the night I realized that just because you don't know someone doesn't mean its going to be terrible. You should break the ice first by doing something funny and making people laugh. I did some pretty embarrassing things that night, but it is all memories and we still laugh about it today.",36.0,6.0
8," My mom and I have a unique relationship. She is my caregiver, but also my best friend; we do everything together. One of our favorite things to do is have dinner at @ORGANIZATION1. If you've ever been to @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2, you'd know that the actual color of the walls is unknown, since every inch of drywall is covered with paintings and photographs. As we were being seated, one particular photograph caught my eye. Directly ahead, to the right of the arcade and underneath an abstract painting of something I couldn't quite identify, hung the greatest snapshot I had ever seen; blacks and whites so vivid the image seemed to have a dreamy-blue tint. It was an up-close photograph of a trickle of water being poured over the head of a chubby baby . There was a slight upturn of the left side of his mouth (accentuating his already pudgy cheeks) as he squinted his eyes to deter the invading trickles. He was simply bewildered by this new sensation. The minute I spotted this masterpiece I lost all sense of self-consciousness and restaurant etiquette. I laughed. I laughed like I had just regained the ability and was desperate to make up for lost time, like suddenly everything that was wrong in the world had frozen and this baby and I were the only two people left. I fell back in the cramped booth, billowing and hollering until my mom couldn't help but join in. In that pure moment, all that mattered was the two of us and that mystery baby, sharing in an innocent bliss called laughter. Have you ever been in one of those awkward silences, when everyone thinks the guy next to him will be the one to start the conversation? It's uncomfortable, at least until somebody chuckles at the irony of the moment, and a chain begins. The next guy laughs at the first guy's untimely giggle, until everyone is rolling around with tears streaming down their face. Those moments are beautiful. Think of a painter with a blank canvas. He'll stare and stare, hopelessly searching for inspiration, but it isn't until he takes a risk and breaks the white silence that all the innovation rushes in. In no time, he has a masterpiece, all thanks to that random splotch of pure desperation that he nervously started out with; that random laugh that caused a chain of joy. Laughter brings people together because its something everyone has in common. When you laugh, and I mean truly laugh, you couldn't be more open to the people around you. Laughing is involuntary; it's the most vulnerable thing you can do. @PERSON1's @CAPS1 defines the term laughter in a very particular way. But laughter can have different meanings for different people. For example, to a scientist, laughter is the contraction of the diaphragm in erratic motions. To a comedian, laughter is a sign of success. To some, laughter refers to embarrassment or failure. But true laughter comes from joy, whether the @CAPS1 says it or not, and its necessary to any healthy life. Although @PERSON1 refers to laughter as ""a sound of or as if of laughing"", it's not entirely true. A laugh is hard to fake; in fact, its nearly impossible. When your boss tells a bad joke and you give him a pity giggle, he can tell. Now when your boss trips over the cord to the projector and you nearly bust a button, he can also tell, because there's nothing like true laughter. We can say that laughter is an important part of life. We can write essays, do surveys, and study patterns until we're blue in the face, but in the end, it all comes down to the real thing. If someone told me to describe laughter to someone who had never laughed before, I would be at a loss. It's an expression that has to be seen, heard, and felt to be comprehended. Even everyday, we text these three letters: @CAPS2, laugh out loud. Why? Because they mean a little bit more then a smiley face or back-to-back ha's. It means that whatever they said to you made you laugh out loud, whether you snorted, honked, or shot your drink out of your nose. If laughter could bring me the simple joy I felt that evening in @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON2, break an awkward silence, or bring two people together in a way that words couldn't, then clearly, laughter is more than just a sound or a function. Sometimes we need to be reminded of that.",44.0,7.0

I've been working here for twelve years now and being segregated form the public society is honestly the one thing i enjoy in this slave-like career. The only inspiration that keeps me alive and running is the fact that after @NUM1 long hours of work i can come home to my gorgeous kids and wife. Being a good father is truly my talent and loving my wife is my favorite hobby. i try to spend as much time possible with my wife and kids but the way our economy is running, i can't afford to get weekends off, that leaves me only afternoons with @PERSON2 and @PERSON3 and only late nights to share with my wife. After many years of going through this systematic lifestyle routine, i entered autopilot mode. I've been in autopilot for quite a long time but i started noticing my wife's decreasing love mood, i still felt that she loved me and i still felt like it was a significant amount but it was just different. i wondered for days and came to the conclusion that we're both aging and we're probably not going to have that teenage love connection forever, but sadly i still loved her the same, if not more. i didn't let such a little thought make me go insane and i played the role of the husband who had no idea their wife awkwardly changing. It was our @NUM2 anniversary and i had asked my boss if i could work a half day so it would be possible to celebrate an important day for me and my wife. I made reservations at the a nice restaurant in the local area and bought her a small necklace with the money I've been saving for the @DATE1 of work, it was made of white gold and it carried a small stone that portrayed love. i had it all planned out and set. i was driving home from work singing along to @PERSON1, happy as i could be and ready to have a marvelous day with my wife. i ran inside to surprise her and witnessed a scene that is engraved in my memory for ever.",37.0,6.0

She had stayed the @TIME1 at @CAPS4 house the @TIME1 before, and we both woke up refreshed and ready for an adventurous @ORGANIZATION2@NUM1 and i had the most spectacular breakfast ever to start off the @ORGANIZATION2... Left over pepperoni pizza! We were both itching for something to do, we couldn't just let a perfect @ORGANIZATION2 be wasted on @CAPS6 @CAPS7, pizza, boys, and sleep. I had mentioned going swimming, but @PERSON2 came up a much more crazy spontaneous idea. She jumped out of her seat almost wetting her pants with excitement and said that we were going to go catch crawdads.""@CAPS8,"" I said, thinking she was just trying to be amusing. It wasn't until she had bags packed, her swimsuit on, and started packing food and drinks, that i realized she was definitely not kidding. I got ready and grabbed @CAPS4 things too. I was ready to proceed, but the one question that stuck in @CAPS4 mind till we got to the end of the street was, "" @CAPS9 is @PERSON2 planning on taking us to go catch these little lobster things she had been talking about""? The sun was beaming down on our faces, making our upper lips feel like soggy caterpillars. I had never walked so far, or had been so hot and sweaty before in the fifteen years i have lived. I was so thankful that i had remembered to put on deodorant. I couldn't even tell you how far we walked, but i will say this, "" @PERSON2 and i started down the street form @ORGANIZATION1 and walked past @PERSON1, up this little back road @CAPS9 we saw nothing but burnt crusty yellow grass and a bunch of cows. We walked all the way to this little trail that was about a ten minute walk to the edge of the @CAPS2. I'm not going to blow smoke up your alley, it was not a straight stretch walk, we took many brakes and stopped at every little place we could find to pee. Not long after we reached our destination, we jumped in the deepest part of the @CAPS2 we could find. The water was ridiculously freezing so we immediately cooled down. we kicked back on the hot rocks and let the sun dry our bodies off. We lit up a cigarette, one of the few we had left from the walk, popped open a @CAPS10.Pepper, and regained our energy@NUM1 and I were finally going to get up and try to find crawdads, even though we were enjoying the sun way too much. We walked along the bank of the @CAPS2 and would lift up rocks to see if any were just chilling under one. @PERSON2 found four before I could even find one. I had never seen one of these miniature crazy lobsters before so I didn't exactly know what I was supposed to be looking for.We had both decided to take another brake, but this time we sat on our floaty in the @CAPS2. After about fifteen minutes of relaxing, I told @PERSON2 I had to pee again. She told me to just pee in the water and no one would ever know, but honestly that would of been so awkward to just stick @CAPS4 bottom half in the water and pee while @PERSON2 was watching. I told her I told her i could hold it until I found a better place. When five minutes passed, I was about to pee out of @CAPS4 eyes; I had to go so bad. I got off of @CAPS4 floaty and started to walk in the water towards the rocks. The sound of the water splashing every time I stepped did not help @CAPS4 situation at all@NUM1 the sneaky little devil she is, decided to grab one of the crawdads she had found and tried to sneak up form behind me with it. I was walking to the perfect place when all of a sudden I felt something cold and @CAPS3 on the back of @CAPS4 neck. I jumped back and turned around almost hitting @PERSON2, to find that she had the crawdad in her hand. She shoved in @CAPS4 face to @CAPS9 I almost cried then threw it on me like it was thing. I fell to the ground in panic and when I stood up, I had realized that I had @CAPS3 @CAPS4 pants. I was mad at first but i couldn't help but laugh. We laughed so hard that tears came out of our eyes. As soon as we tried to get our selves together, we realized that we had not packed an extra change of cloths.

8," Over this last @DATE1 some friends and I were down at the park hanging out; trying to enjoy the last few weeks of freedom we had left. We were siting outside of the restrooms, for reasons I'm not sure of, when @PERSON1 needed to tell me something. So we got up and went into the girls room, leaving @PERSON2 all alone outside. After we talked for a few minutes we started to walk out so @PERSON2 wouldn't be alone any more, but right as I reached for the door i saw the light switch and I thought it would be funny to turn the lights off when @PERSON1 wasn't paying attention. When I flipped them off @PERSON1 let out a high pitched screech, and right then we had an idea to scare @PERSON2. Instead of going back outside, we stared to scream and bang on all the walls, trying to make as much noise as we possibly could. After about five minutes of that we splashed water on our faces and went to go give our company to @PERSON2. When we walked out his face was priceless; eyes wide open, jaw dropped and his cheeks were extremely red. He asked us what happened in there, and @PERSON1's reply was ""That's none of your concern!"" and we all started to laugh; though @PERSON2's laugh was more of an awkward laugh. And now every time we go to the park we can't help but to remember that day, and how @PERSON2 still does not know what happened.",30.0,5.0
8,"   Have you ever had a really bad day and nothing could make it better? When you just feel like giving up but then your best friend comes along and some how changes that all because they know just what to do. Well that happened to me. My best friend and her mom are amazing. They both are there for me and it is like they are my other family. When I need someone most I go to them because they always know just what to say and do when things get bad.    It had been a long week and everything was going down hill fast at home. My dad and I were constantly fighting and so were my boyfriend and I. It was on the @TIME1 of @DATE1, after a five hour dance practice as my friend, @PERSON3, and I headed back to her house for the @TIME1. As we were walking my dad called me and asked me what happened at school that day. I of course, had no idea what he was talking about and he started yelling, the beginning of yet another fight. He said the school called for I had missed a class that day. I completely forgot and explained calmly what had happened and why I did not go to class. He began to yell more. He started to tell me that I was not aloud to see my boyfriend anymore also I was not aloud to spend the @TIME1 at @PERSON3's house anymore, I began to yell now. After about ten minutes he hung up and I broke down. @PERSON3 talked to me and calmed me down. We got to her house and went on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. As I sat there and watched her on the computer I text my boyfriend telling him my dad said he was no longer able to come over. I called him and he yelled at me then said, ""@CAPS3 is not going to work out. We fight too much and I can not take it any longer."" I broke down and hung up on him.   Walking into @PERSON3's room her mom walked in and held me as I wept in her arms. She was a little intoxicated and was telling me that boys are dumb and they do not think before they speak. She helped me calm down and as I did @PERSON3 walked in and began to tell me what she had told my now ex-boyfriend. I smiled a little. They both started telling me that I could find someone better and I would be fine. Even though I was completely crushed. As @PERSON3's dad walked by her mom yelled for him to come into the room so I could hit him because I was mad at boys and it would help me calm down. I began to laugh. Sitting on the floor, I grabbed a towel that was laying on the ground next to me and began to wipe my @CAPS1, as I did, @PERSON3 told me that was her towel and yelled down the hall at her mom that I wiped my boogers on her towel, @CAPS3 made me laugh a little more. We laid down and watched @CAPS4.V. then went to sleep.   Waking up the next morning I did not feel any better but still got the momentum to get ready. As we got ready for doing nothing that day we talked and laughed about every thing. My day was not going that bad. As the day went on we grew restless and really needed something to pass the time. Just then our friend, @PERSON1 called and asked if we wanted to go dancing with her and @PERSON2. We said yes and got ready and went out with them. We were having a good time laughing every time a boy asked us to dance, and every time we said no. We stayed for about two hours and as we left @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 got these two random guys numbers. We then went to @ORGANIZATION1's house and spent the @TIME1. All four of us were laughing and watching movies, then three o'clock rolled around and we were all exhausted. We climbed into bed and slept peacefully throughout the @TIME1. As we awoke the next morning we were all still pretty tired but put on music and again got ready for an uneventful day. Getting ready we were screaming songs and laughing for we all sounded terrible but it did not matter since we were having a whimsical time. That is my story when laughing helped me, seeing laughing is a good cure for a broken heart. When people laugh they always feel happy doing it. You hear laughter where ever you go and it is such a magical sound. No other sound can compare to a laugh. Laughing is not only a medicine for a broken heart but also a good work out for your abs. So take a couple minutes out of you day to have a good laugh, you will sleep better and people love to hear it.",36.0,6.0

8,"Laughter is a tool that every one knows how to use. It can be used when having a good time with friends or meeting someone new. When I am around people I don't know I feel uncomfortable so I wont start a conversation. I listen to others talk to people that I do know and then ad my own opinion to their conversation. You could call it eavesdropping but I think of it as studying some ones personality before trying to get to know them. If you here some one tell a joke or laugh at one that gives you an idea of what their sense of humor is like. I get to know someone by trying to make them laugh and observing there reaction for example when I met my friend @PERSON1's dad @PERSON8. I met him when my friend @PERSON5 invited me to go camping with his family. @PERSON5 is @PERSON1's little brother but they have different dads @PERSON5 and his twin sister @PERSON2 are the same age as me and the youngest is @PERSON4 but like every little sibling the rest find her annoying. The last five people in are group were @PERSON1's twins @CAPS1 and @PERSON3, @PERSON5's girlfriend, @PERSON1's boyfriend, and @PERSON2's boyfriend @PERSON7 but every one calls him @CAPS2. Their mother @PERSON6 drove us to the camp grounds and then left that confused me because I didn't know that @PERSON8 was meeting us there or even who he was. When @PERSON8 arrived we had already setup our tents and started a fire as i helped to unpack @PERSON8's car @PERSON1 introduced me to her dad and everyone continued unpacking as @PERSON8 told us what he brought and and where we should put it. After everything was unpacked we had to decide who was sleeping in which tent @PERSON8 brought his own tent, my brother lent me his, and @PERSON1 brought one too. I wanted to sleep in the tent i brought but @PERSON1 had planed on having a tent for her and her boyfriend on one side of the tent and the boys @CAPS1 and @PERSON3 on the other. The other tent had two teenage couples in it and i hate feeling like a third wheel. My only options were to sleep with @PERSON4 and the boys on one side of the tent or sleep in @LOCATION1's tent. When @PERSON1 told this to me and @PERSON8 in an attempt to be funny he said ""I don't bite but I do swing in my sleep so if you wake up with a black eye my bad"" they both laughed and i let out an uncomfortable chuckle then began moving my gear to @PERSON8's tent. The day when on as we all ate and talked around the table at our camp I stared singing a @CAPS4 song to my self and @PERSON8 recognized it. He told me that's a good song I asked if he spoke @CAPS4 he said yes then told me how he learned how and a story of someone who was talking trash in @CAPS4 and thought he couldn't understand. I then told him that i think its funny to speak @CAPS4 with my friends around people that cant understand he said that a lot of people find that offensive and disrespectful. When it got dark one by one everyone went to bed my sleeping bag was around the center of the tent because it was set up on a hill. The next day i woke up in the lowest corner of the tent when i got out to see who else was awake it was just me and the adults we laughed as @PERSON8 said how I slid to the side of the tent and then down to the corner. After breakfast We spent the after noon at the beach. When we got back @PERSON8, @PERSON2, @CAPS2, and I went to the sand dunes next to camp. We decided that we wanted to go for a hike to see if we could reach the beach. I thought we would be walking in sand the hole time so i left my shoes at camp. we didn't see the beach only bigger sand dunes that looked like they lasted forever. It was getting dark and @PERSON8 wanted to get us all back to camp why there was still sun light. So we went strait through the brush instead of around again. I walked bare foot through thorns, sticks, rocks, bushes, and I had to jump off a tree that was in are way. when I got back to I was tired my feat were hurting and bleeding but I was happy @PERSON8 couldn't stop talking about how proud he was of me. He told everyone that i never complained or slowed down he was joking that i should have bin his son and that my feet were made of rock my feet were in pain but all i could do was laugh. I made a new friend that day and to me laughter was what sealed are friendship. today i still look back and laugh.",35.0,6.0
8," Laughter is a good part of life. It demonstrates character. My sister, @CAPS1, can make me laugh, even when I'm mad at her. She is silly, yet serious when she needs to be. She likes to think of others before herself, and that gets her into more trouble than it has helped her. @CAPS1 and I go way back to when she was two years old and I was four or five years old. She is not my biological sister. My family has ""adopted"" her into the family, after her and I had become best friends. We have always been there for each other. We have never left each other out in the dark. One year when I was twelve and she was ten, I was staying at her house, and I had learned this song in choir at the elementary school that I was attending,and I taught her the song. It goes: ""@CAPS2, @CAPS2 baby, @CAPS2 by the roller coaster, sweep, sweep baby, I don't wanna @CAPS3 you go, shimmy shimmy coca puff, shimmy shimmy rah, shimmy shimmy coca puff, shimmy shimmy break @CAPS2, two bad kids sitting on a fence trying to make a dollar out of @MONEY1, @CAPS9 they missed, they missed, they missed like this"" and @CAPS17 it just repeats itself getting faster and faster. @CAPS1 had this idea to change it. She said ""@CAPS3's say, your hot instead of the break @CAPS2 part."" @CAPS4 now we were walking @CAPS2 the street singing the ""new"" version of the song that @CAPS1 had made, and @CAPS9 some guy was walking on the side walk going the opposite direction. @CAPS1 pointed at him while we sang the ""your hot"" part and he stopped and said "" @CAPS6, I think I am a little too old for you two."" We started to laugh @CAPS4 hard that our sides hurt. After we calmed @CAPS2 from laughing @CAPS4 hard, we told him that we didn't mean to point at him, and that we were just singing. I think @CAPS1 did because when we got back to her house she told me that she though he was cute, @CAPS4 maybe she did mean to point at him or maybe she didn't, I never asked her.  The day after that, we had gotten into a fight at her house, @CAPS4 I left and walked around the block for quite some time. @PERSON1 her mother, came and looked for me. I was sitting at this beautiful white church @CAPS2 the street from her house. @PERSON1 came looking for me and when she found me she sat next to me and asked why I was @CAPS2 here all by myself. I told her ""@CAPS8 and I got into a fight over a boy that we both like, and she told me to go back home, I'm not wanted here anymore. @CAPS4 I left and went for a walk and stopped here."" ""@CAPS9 @CAPS1 does get worked up over boys. Would you like to come back or sit here awhile longer?""  ""A little longer please."" I said, and with that @PERSON1 got up and walked back home. About fifteen to twenty minutes later, @CAPS1 came looking for me. She saw me at the church and ran over. She sat @CAPS2 and said ""@CAPS12, I'm sorry that I said that. I don't really want you to go home. Will you please come back to the house?"" ""Is @PERSON1 telling you to do this"" I asked ""@CAPS13, I haven't talked to mom yet, why did mom come looking for you?"" ""@CAPS14, and I told her what happen."" ""@CAPS6, that's why she checked on me"" ""@CAPS16, yeah probably."" @CAPS17 i got really quiet again, cause I was still upset with her. ""@CAPS18 you still mad at me"" @CAPS8 asked. ""A little."" I admitted. ""@CAPS20 @CAPS16, remember when we went swimming at the beach and dad threw me in, and we both teamed up and pushed him in the deep spot?"" ""@CAPS14 that was funny. When he got out he threw the both of us at the same time!"" ""@CAPS16 yeah, and we landed on each other!"" I realized that the more I was laughing at the memory, the more I wasn't upset anymore. I don't know if it was the story, or because I was laughing. When she realized I wasn't mad anymore she said ""@CAPS23 go see if we can go to the beach again. Its getting really warm out today."" I shook my head @CAPS14, @CAPS4 we ran back to her house and asked, they said @CAPS14. @CAPS4 for the rest of the day, we laughed, screamed, and smiled, as we pushed @CAPS24, @PERSON1, and each other into the water. To this day she is till my best friend, and my sister at heart.",37.0,6.0
8,"It all started off on a cold sunny @DATE1 @TIME1, we had all planned on a great day of snowmobiling. It was a perfect day for snowmobiling, so all of our group (which included my best freind @PERSON2, @PERSON2's @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1, my freind @CAPS1, @CAPS1's brother, and @CAPS3.) all loaded up the snowmobiles onto their load-on load-off trailer.From then we made sure we had enuff gas and for the long trail ride threw the mountains in @ORGANIZATION2, along with that we made sure that all of us had enuff jackets,food, and water to last us the small trip. Now it was time to hit the road and drive the short but crooked road up to the the unloading parking lot, so even tho it doesnt go as the crow flies it only takes about @NUM1 minutes from town and we were right out of town it only took us about @NUM2 minutes. After our short but crooked ride up to the unloading parking lot it was time to unload the snowmobiles and putt them around the parking lot to get them warmed up for our long ride to the summit, while doing so my freind @PERSON2 had ridden up the side of a bank where the snow plow had shoved snow off the main highway and rolled his snowmobilePersonally I thought it was hilarious but on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 didn't think it was so funny but he got over it and we moved on our way arossed the highway and up wide and washboard path,as we made it further and further up the path it became more narrow and we started getting into fresh snow where no one had ridden yet. We kept riding for about another @NUM3 miles or so then we finally made it to our destination, the summit. From there we rode to the very top of the summit where it drops off and you can look over the whole valley which was coverd in white packed snow that had just fallen the day before and while we were there. We dazed for a moment then walked back over to the snowmobiles. Then we started off on our trip back down to a meddow where locals camp durring the @DATE2. As we were leaving my freind @PERSON2 desided that he wanted to go up a hillclimb one last time before we left and told us that he would catch up to us. We crossed over a bridge that crossed a creek that ran threw the meddow and waited awhile then soon realized that somthing had happend because he was taking along time to catch up considering the fact that he is known to be a speed demon, so we turned around to see what had happend. We soon realized what had happend, @PERSON2 had ridden into the creek where the creek bed branched off and made a island. So we grabbed some rope that we braught along with us and tied one end of the rope to one of the skies and the other end of the rope to the back of the snowmobile in hope that it would just pull right out, but it didn't. So then three of us (@PERSON1, @CAPS1, and @CAPS3) hopped down into the creek and pushed on the back of the snow mobile then it finally became unstuck. After being frustrated about it for so long we all had to laugh about how it happend and made the best of it. And from that day forward I always make fun of @PERSON2 for driving his snowmobile into a creek on accidentand I feel that laughing about it made the whole problem better.",39.0,6.0
8,"There have been many times in my life that I have had a good long worthwhile laugh. Things like scaring people, embarrassing myself in public, and doing stupid stuff for bets. But some of my favorite memories involving a good laugh were with people that I love. It was in the middle of the @DATE1, my youth group and I were going on a missions trip to a place in eastern @LOCATION1 called @LOCATION2. @LOCATION2 is a small town with a population of three-hundred, and is about four-blocks by four-blocks. Our whole purpose of going there was to set up a @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, for the fifty kids that live there. In our opinion, it was a major success. But the @CAPS1 isn't where all the laughs come in, it is pretty much anytime between them.  This was another one of those times where some of the best memories happen in a swimming pool. Other than the church we were staying in, we spent the most time swimming. In the pool were some of the best, and worst, times that I had in @LOCATION2. For example, I love doing tricks and flips into pools, but there needs to be a long and bouncy diving board. That's exactly what @LOCATION2 had. With my youth group, we spent hours upon hours playing and do tricks with the diving board. When we got bored with that, which took at least an hour and a half, there were many people up for a pool game or two. Which one pool game with us lasts about a hour. So, like the diving board, we spent a ton of time with it. This leads me to my worst times I had, the pool games. I have been known for being a very competitive person, and the during the games my competitive spirit was definitely shown. That made it easy for me to get mad at myself, which was why it was one of the worst times. But now looking back on these great but horrible nights, I say I was being stupid. I had some of my best friends by my side and I was mad? I now look back it and laugh, just like every other memories I have of the little town of @LOCATION2.  As I said earlier, @LOCATION2 was very small town with only about two cops. So we decided that no matter where we went in the town, we were going to ride in the back of a truck. That meant about thirty kids in the back of a @ORGANIZATION2 in the small town of @LOCATION2. This was fun but embarrassing for most. But during these car adventures were where we had some of the best laughs. Things like the guys all pretending to be the wings to make the car go, or the girls doing doing the guys hair, or even having funny conversations talking about the events that happened that day. The driver would also have a fun time, by swerving back and forth on the road just enough to make us off balance but not to make us fall off, we then learned quickly to hold on to anything within reaching length. The laughing didn't stop there, it continued on little trips I made with friends.  In @LOCATION2 we took many little adventures of our own while we were there. But my favorite would have to be with my two best friends. We had to make a video of our whole trip there. We were like those annoying people that always have their cameras out and were taking videos, but that made the job all the more fun for us. Our little adventure started when our pastor said we were going to take videos of the never ending fields surrounding @LOCATION2. It was just us three guys so we made a good time of it, and it was one of the best times all three of us had there. We did things like standing through the sunroof of the truck, and climbing through an old broken down wheat mill. Unfortunately for us, the one day we decided to be crazy in the car, the one cop from @LOCATION2 was roaming around. But that made it more exhilarating for us. That trip was not only fun, it was a good time and it brought us closer together as friends.  The @LOCATION2 trip was one of the best trips any of us have ever been on. That not only makes for good memories, but it makes for a good laugh. Every time any of us see each other we look back on the memories of @LOCATION2 like swimming and playing pool games, riding in the bed of the truck, having our own little adventures, or even going snipe hunting trip. @LOCATION2 was a growing experience, not only for me but also the ones that I love. So as I have said before every time I remember @LOCATION2 I laugh out loud, making my day feel better than it was before. ",41.0,7.0
8," The sunset shimmers off of the sparkling water in @LOCATION1, where seven bald eagles perch high in the limbs of a bare spruce tree.This phenomenon occurs every day in the @DATE1 of a remote town called @LOCATION1, nestled in the heart of the mountains, and located on the southeast peninsula of the great state of @LOCATION2. Dad, @CAPS1 and I travel to @LOCATION1 annually, where my dad owns a wharf called the @CAPS2's @CAPS3. My sister and i usually travel with him to spend time with our grandparents, who have maintained a permanent residence in @LOCATION1 since my dad was a young boy. We also go to enjoy the great amenities this area has to offer, both business and pleasure. We go crabbing, commercial fishing, hunting and boating, but also enjoy hiking on the various mountain trails, located directly in the backyard. My sister and I busk every year, setting a guitar or violin case out and playing our instruments for the thousands of people that come into this waterfront town from the humongous cruise ships, to make a sufficient profit.On one particular memorable occasion, something happened that if laughter was not an element of, there would of been a totally different outcome.  This story takes place when my sister and i had just finished playing for the tourists and we biked over to our dad's dock. This is late in the @TIME1, and we are going to our grandparents home. But, @CAPS5 veers off from the highway and stops the small truck we are in. My father gets out of the vehicle, and tells my sister to hop in the drivers seat. She is visibly excited to try and drive this ancient @ORGANIZATION1 pickup, and puts the truck into gear. The vehicle suddenly lurches and in a flash, the engine sputters, and dies. Inquisitively, @CAPS1 looks at him and @CAPS5 replies in a calm tone that this model is a stick shift . Then, my dad looks back to see me squished against the rear window, lodging myself for her next driving attempt, and tells me to give it a try. Cautiously I ease in the clutch, barely pressing the gas pedal, and start a steady crawl. And instantly, the truck dies. Several days later, my sister leaves on a five day excursion, crabbing as a deckhand for my uncle. I have gone down for a couple days in her absence, busking on my own. On one day back to the house, my dad stops on the remote road again, and stops, getting out of the drivers seat. I get in, trying my very best to not expose my nervousness, and strap in. The pickup lurches as though stung by a bee, my dad purposely mushing his head and stiffening his neck into the head rest. Sheepishly, I put the truck into motion, and ease out the clutch as slowly as possible. In doing so, the accomplishment and swiftness startles me, and the engine chokes and goes out.  Throughout the course of three more days, after each days activities, I would drive a fair stretch of road, with hills, stoplights and other obstacles. Although the driving age is @NUM1, and I am of that age, it is illegal to drive without a permit in any country or state.My sister, after several days of strenuous crabbing, comes back and on the way home, we stop again at the designated driving spot. She gets the @ORGANIZATION1 moving for about ten feet, but when it comes time to increase speed, the engine coughs. @CAPS1 and I switch, and I play with the fact that she does not know that I have been driving for about a week. I falsely try to familiarize myself with the brake, gas and clutch and intentionally kill the motor, propelling us forward. Then, I cleanly start the truck, and professionally drive off, going onto the highway, and onto the severe hill where on the top, my grandparents three story house is.   As I get out of the drivers seat, I can see my sister extremely distraught in the back seat. She is literally in tears, because as departed from the wheel, my father said with a sense of pride swelling in his voice, ""that's my boy, you really have a driving knack, just like your old man."" @CAPS5 said this as to further provoke the hilarity of the situation, but it just pushed my sister over the edge. She storms out of the cab, and marches up the stairs of our grandparents house. My dad and I sit, perplexed at her severe emotional level, and then I go up and tell her, saying that i have practiced for every day she has been gone, and it was all a joke.My sister looks at me, stunned, then a sly grin creeps on to her face. She breaks out in laughter, and I then realize if @CAPS1 had reacted any differently, this story could have taken a different toll due to the illegal component, but mainly this incident could have ended in a ghastly way, her telling mom.",41.0,7.0
8,"  Laughter has played a significant role in my life, getting myself and my loved ones through hard times. Helping to keep the smiles on our faces even when every aspect around us @MONTH1 cause us to frown. In my eyes, with laughter every day seems a whole lot brighter.   When I was younger my family was very close, I lived with my mom,dad,and sister. My dad worked full time while my mom stayed home and took care of us, we had, what you can imagine, a pretty normal life style. Not rolling in wealth, but my dad made a pretty comfortable living. In my eyes everything seemed perfect. What i couldn't see was the cracks in the foundation of there relationship. Nor would i ever be able to understand, at my age of six, that some things are not meant to be. They role played such a realistic, fantastic, but fake happiness and mutual love for one another for so long. But they could no longer pretend. They were numb, emotionless. going day to day on auto pilot, a change was desperately needed. It all came to a screeching halt one @DATE1 after noon, I remember that day like it was yesterday. It was a normal morning. Then a fight broke out, I knew this had to be the point of one of them giving in.. They had never fought in front of us before. He stormed out and left us, just like every other morning. Except this time my heart was heavy, I could feel the salty tears about to fall.. I knew he wasn't coming back. Shortly he turned around and made his way back into the living room, where everyone was arranged along the couch. Next comes the talk, the dreaded talk that no one wants to hear. ""its not your fault, some things just don't work out...etc.""in the end though, all of those thoughts are already automatically lodged into your head. Then it was over, it felt so unreal. The family was officially torn between two, reality hurt. Although the truth is much sweeter than living a lie. I remember how hard my mom tried not to show her true emotions, @CAPS1 laughed and joked around with me and my sister to hide the depth of her heart ache. My dad moved into a small home, and my mom moved into a comfortable home of her own. Custody wasn't an issue because there was no way in hell my mom would even consider giving up custody of us. My dad knew that he was not going to win that battle, he settled at her request. We started remodeling our new home. It was a place where my mom would feel independent, accomplished. @CAPS1 would stay up all night working on the kitchen, making every single part of it perfect. @CAPS1 wanted it to be a place for us to grow and flourish, a place to call our own. Saying my mom was a perfect mom would without a doubt be an under statement, @CAPS1 took us on trips, kept the smiles on our faces, encouraged us to pursue anything we wished to do, comforted us, laughed with us, appreciated us, took care of us. Not only did @CAPS1 do all of that, @CAPS1 did it all on her own. That to me,still to this day, makes me smile. So many memories still flood my brain with colorful images of our past. We lived a very warm and fofilling chapter of all of our lives there. My mom met someone in the later years, who soon became a very important person in my life. My step dad. They were married happily, seeing someone treat her so amazing, was truly heart warming. Together they had my youngest sister and our life became very different. It was no longer the three of us. I couldn't grasp the idea of it at first but seeing my mom happy was a very good thing for me and what i came to realize is that it was the beginning of our new family. Our new life. Life sometimes will throw you off coarse, but a true test of character is what you do with the challenges thrown your way. Laughing and making the best out of every situation is truly something to feel accomplished of. My family has been through a lot together, in my opinion it has shaped us and made us stronger as a whole. laughter is a key element in my family's relationship, and even if we are past a lot of those hardships, it is always important to keep on smiling. Keeping the good energy flowing. With out laughter i couldn't visualize half of the good memories I have had. I can look bad at what we have gone through, and see the bad times. More importantly though, I can look back and remember what got us to how we are today. laughter is something that I will forever be grateful for.   ",39.0,6.0

8,"  My friends and I always have a great time together, it seems like all we do is laugh. Last @DATE1 while my friend @CAPS1 and I were hanging out we got a phone call from our other friend @PERSON1. She was all alone in her house and told us there was a ghost in her house and that she kept hearing footsteps. She asked if we would come over for a little bit, we thought she was going crazy but we went to her house anyways.   When we got there @PERSON1 looked terrified. She was getting mad that we didn't believe there was a ghost in her house so she told us to follow her and see if we could hear the same thing she was hearing. We all went in the back room, turned all the lights off, and laid completely still. At first we heard nothing, then all of a sudden it sounded like someone walking down the hall. Quickly we turned the lights back on and started back to whatever it was that we were doing.   Later that day, @PERSON1 decided to take a shower, so @CAPS1 and I just stayed in the front room and watched @CAPS3. All of a sudden we heard this big crash, it almost sounded as if @PERSON1 had fallen in the shower. We ran into the bathroom and asked if she was okay and she said she was perfectly fine but was a little frightened by that loud noise. She gets out of the shower and finds a picture frame that was hanging on the wall, on the floor and broken, we all wondered how that could happen when it hadn't been bumped or anything. Although we were hysterically laughing, all we could think of was the ghost!  As @CAPS1 and I are getting ready to leave @CAPS5 house and go home for the night we invited @PERSON1 to come stay with us so the ghost doesn't get her. When she asks her mom, her mom said no but that we can stay their if we want. @PERSON1 was begging and pleading with us to stay, so much it started becoming funny. Thinking it was funny we kept saying no, and that we didn't want to stay in a haunted house. We stayed for a little longer then we got up to leave and tell @PERSON1 goodbye while laughing so hard we can barley talk because of how scared she was.  In conclusion, laughter was a big part in this story. I also believe that laughter is an important part of any relationship. You cant have good friendships with out laughter, life would be dull and boring. As you can tell from this story, my friends and I, can find something funny or something to laugh about even in the worst situation.  ",36.0,6.0
8,"  Everybody laughs in their life time, sometimes they are good laughs other times they are bad laughs but in the end you have a good time wherever you are. Here is my story about why laughter is important in any relationship.  When you are in a relationship and they make jokes, you laugh because they are funny to you there for you laugh at them. If you didn't then why even say jokes anymore there would be no point in even saying them or reading about them or anything. Lots of people learn about them, study them, and say them to try and make people laugh so they would all have a great time. I think everybody has laughed and made jokes and just did funny things to make other people laugh because some people like seeing others happy. When you laugh that makes you smile and basically in a way that means your happy.  I know when i see my friends laugh or people that i know laugh it kinda makes me laugh and it makes me happy and then we all just make jokes and we all laugh some more and just have a good time. I love seeing people happy and laugh because it totally makes my day so much better especially if its someone I'm in a relationship with.  I think everybody should laugh in there life time because everybody should be happy and enjoy there life so laugh and be happy and your life will be amazing! I'm pretty sure there is not one person in this life time that has not laughed once in there relationship.   Your partner should always try to make the other person happy because that's just what you do and how your relationship work's. If the other person doesn't make you happy or laugh then why be in it because i was in a relationship one time and i was not happy at all because he never made me laugh or feel alive like you should when your with someone. We were so much better as friends then we were when we were together. So before you start dating someone you should make sure you actually like him and he makes you laugh and makes you happy before you guys get together. If you don't then you will always ask yourself why you got with him and when you should break it off and if you really should or not. You should get to know him more then you do and see if you guys are way happy as friends and then try being together. That's what i didn't do, i didn't get to know him enough and we were really good friends so i thought we would work but i was wrong. I had to break up with him because it was killing me knowing that he didn't make me laugh and he never will so i had to say good bye and i did. It was hard but sometimes its just something people need to do. So now we try and to be friends again but its not really working like i thought. We haven't talked in like a week. So sometimes that's just things you have to sacrifice.  ",35.0,6.0
8," Laughter to me is important in any relationship, whether its between friends and family or you beloved other. To me it's like the gateway to any conversation. Through laughter is how me and my boyfriend met. @PERSON1 is one of the funniest people I have ever met. I have always thought that a person that could make me laugh would be the right one for me. @PERSON1 right now, at this point in my life is the perfect match. When @PERSON1 and I just met it was more of a friendship. We got to know each other, we hung-out, and we both didn't want a relationship at this time in our life. The more we talked the more fun I had with him. I can't stand to be a serious person at all, to me it is so boring. When we talked there was nothing serious about our conversations. He would make me laugh about the simplest things. @PERSON1 liked to quote funny movies, talk about awkward situations, joke around, etc.. After the fist couple of weeks I realized that the only times I was always smiling or found myself having a lot of fun was when I was around @LOCATION1. It's what brought me to like him even more as a friend. Although he was always a fun person to be around and also the one to go to so I could have a laugh, he also used laughter to get me to open up when I was feeling down.  I've always had a rough life at home and at times it's really hard on me. When it get really hard I shut down and I won't talk to anyone. Even though @PERSON1 was the person to always make me feel better, I wouldn't talk to him either. I found it very hard to talk to him and tell him what was going through my mind. @PERSON1 understood that and he would try to make me laugh little by little. He wouldn't make me laugh at stupid things or anything or even my situation. He would make me laugh at simple things, the way he said something, or he would try and do something so he could grab my attention. While those times he would make me laugh, it also made me see that I could open up to him. He wasn't making fun of my situation or trying to just find out about my home life and what troubled me, he was trying to make me feel comfortable and get me to relax. It made me feel more relaxed and like he wasn't trying to judge me or say my problems would get better even though sometimes that isn't the real answer I'm looking for. I ended up opening up to him. I can now tell him absolutely everything and in the end he'll always make me laugh about it.  This story might not be the best story at telling how laughter is an element or anything but to me it's the best at telling how a person can open up and relationships are built. I in no way was looking for a relationship at all and yet now I find myself with a person that can even make me laugh at myself. Laughter cant cat also get people to open up. If I could open up about my problems and actually talk to somebody, it could happen to anyone else to. @PERSON1's benignity and laughter put together is what brought me to him.To me in this story it just shows how laughter is what got us into this great relationship.",37.0,6.0
8," I believe that laughter is a huge part of any relationship. It doesn't just help make the relationship stronger, but it also brings you closer. It shows that your having fun and that's what its all about. I mean who wants to have a boring relationship with someone? I know I wouldn't because life is all about having fun and doing what you enjoy most. If laughter didn't exist than this world would be an extremely boring place to be.  My best friend and I are always doing something to make us laugh. I think that are relationship of being such close friends is because we both have a silly personality. We are like to peas in a pod. We absolutely love to have an amazing time doing things we enjoy and always laughing at the stupidest things that aren't even funny half the time. When I get really down or depressed about something I can always count on her to cheer me up and make me laugh. She will also make me extremely mad sometimes, but she fixes it by laughing at me and then it tends to make me laugh as well. She is my other half and I don't know what I would do without her. The funniest thing that has ever happened in our six years of being best friends is when we were playing @NUM1 grade kick ball in physical education. We are both blond and sometimes the blondness tends to get to our brains. As we were playing we were both on the same team of course. We were in the outfield because it was the other teams turn to kick. Someone on the other team kicked the ball super hard as it almost hit the top of the gym. As it was flying up high in the air we were both going for it.  We weren't paying attention to where we were running because we were so focused on being the one to catch the ball. All of a sudden we ran right into each other. We fell to the floor laughing hysterically almost to the point where we couldn't breath and tears were pouring down our cheeks. Of course everyone else who was out playing kick ball almost died laughing as well. That is one story that I will never forget. Laughter could be a good thing to have if you want to succeed in life. It helps you get through the day and it can help take your mind off things if you aren't having quite the day you thought you would be having. I know that my best friend @CAPS1 will always cheer me up by laughing with me or at me. She is the type that loves to have a good time and we both just click. Our personality's are almost the same, but she is a little more crazy. She is loud and always has a smile on her face. We practically always have something funny to tell each other. I am the type that is always laughing at everything. People usually make fun of me because I laugh so much, but its not a bad thing because I am someone who likes to make other people laugh and have a good time. Laughter is a big part in life and I believe it because you can't have fun without having a smile on your face or laughing. I know that when I grow older I will look back at my past and laugh about all the stupid things I did. It doesn't just make you stronger it makes you want to live your life to the fullest and enjoy every moment you can because you never know when that time can come to an end.  Memories are always something you can look back on and laugh at. I hope that I will be able to have many more memories and look back and laugh at all the stupid things I did and the choices I made. You learn from your mistakes. Laughter is the best thing anyone could do. It puts you in a good mood and shows that you are a happy person. No one wants to be around a boring person. I sure know I wouldn't. I love to have a good time and Laughter is a big part in my life. ",38.0,6.0
8,"                       laughter is the best medicine @CAPS1 mother, @CAPS1 father and me have always been close. For as long as i can remember they have been @CAPS1 best friends. I would tell them about anything that bothered me. I am an only child so @CAPS1 mom is like the sister i never had. We used to go on picnics together. We would walk and talk and @CAPS8 would warn me of the dangers of the world. I liked those walks best. @CAPS8 would tell me stories of her childhood and make me laugh, we loved to laugh. As time went by I began to grow apart from @CAPS1 mother, I looked for friends to take her place. I think that hurt her the most. we would grow close from time to time, but lets face facts I was growing up. One day me and @CAPS1 mother were on our way out to the car after just finishing lunch. @CAPS8 and I had been discussing something and the conversation was taking a turn for the worst. It had turned from a mere discussion to an argument. You could feel the tension in the air, our tempers were skating on thin ice. I wasn't sure how this was going to end. We walked out to the car in silence. I remember thinking to myself (well wonderful @CAPS2, what have you gotten yourself into this time?) I opened @CAPS1 car door and stepped inside, I looked up and saw that @CAPS1 mother was watching me in the mirror. I began to feel these dark, cold, angry emotions twords her, emotions that made me feel sinister. I had never felt this way about her before. It was all so new to me. I thought back to those times when I had been sad, or upset and @CAPS8 would make me laugh. or the days when I had had one of those bad days at school where nothing went right and I would come home to her waiting smile and loving arms. @CAPS8 would make me a cup of hot coco and we would laugh and joke about those girls at school that made you feel like your life wasnt that important. I wanted one of those moment so bad right then I would have given anything for one. Just then it was as if @CAPS8 had heard @CAPS1 thoughts. I looked up and found her trying to suppress a smile. I too began to feel that small tickle deep within you that made you have the urge to laugh. A panic rose in @CAPS1 mind. (@CAPS3 @CAPS2, don't give in, you must stay mad or you will have lost the argument.) I tried and tried not to laugh, but it was @CAPS3 use. A giggle started in @CAPS1 throat. Then @CAPS1 mother began to giggle as well. not long after @CAPS1 father too began to laugh. pretty soon we were all rolling around on the floor of the car laughing histarickly. what we must have looked like the three of us laughing so hard. after a while we calmed down. Our stomachs aced from laughing so hard. ""@CAPS5 were you laughing?"" @CAPS1 mother asked. ""I don't know, I was laughing cause you were laughing. @CAPS5 were you laughing?"" I asked. ""I was laughing because your father had made a funny face."" @CAPS1 mother replied. ""@CAPS7 @CAPS5 were you laughing?"" @CAPS8 asked @CAPS1 father. ""I was laughing because I felt left out of the big joke and I couldn't believe I missed it."" Said @CAPS1 father. We all busted up laughing again at our ridiculous reasons for laughter. After awhile i couldn't even remember @CAPS5 i had been mad in the first place. I looked at @CAPS1 mother and the angry emotions were gone, i had @CAPS3 hard feelings twords her, only love. I believe @CAPS8 felt the same. To this day I cant remember the argument or how it had started. All I know is that laughter is the best medicine. A world without laughter would be a terrible thing to see.                                                                       the end",33.0,6.0
8," Have you ever noticed that if two little kids can make each other laugh then they instantly become friends? I don't know what it is about kids but they tend to just ignore the things they don't like about you and just focus on the interesting and good parts. I was in kindergarten and this happened to me. You would think it would be a small part of my life but its probably one of the biggest most important things that ever happened to me. I met @LOCATION1, to this day we've been best friends for over a decade and it started with just a laugh. It was the first day of kindergarten and I was stoked. I went to preschool in the building outside of my new school so it wasn't really that new to me but I was still excited. I walked into my new class and seen a lot of friends I haven't seen during the @DATE1. I seen a few new kids and immediately took interest. Their was this new girl, I heard the teacher call her @LOCATION1. During playtime she walked up to me and asked if i wanted to be friends with her. I laughed because I thought it was an obvious question. Why wouldn't I want to be friends with her? Shes a kid right? she just wants to have fun like me? I don't know why it was so funny it's just abnormal that she had to ask. After that laugh we've been best friends ever since. I'm not going to say it was easy staying best friends. their have been tons of bumps in the road. at times I felt we were losing each other but we just started noticing things about each other that bothered us. I was wondering why we didn't notice these things before but we were just kids. all we did was play and laugh. We still got through it, it wasn't easy but it was defiantly worth it. We've had our fights but we always end up laughing about them later and I think that's what makes us such good friends. As the days go on it still gets hard sometimes but we just laugh it out. we both have our lives and sometimes it seems like theirs no room to laugh but we find ways. We both changed so much and sometimes I wish I could just go back to finding just the good in people. I try but I always end up seeing the bad too. Today it's still important for us to make each other laugh. If we couldn't do that then I don't think we would even be friends anymore. Its a big part of our friendship and I'm sure it will always be. Shes helped me through so much by just making me laugh and I wish I could do the same for her. I think laughter is a big part of ANY relationship, @CAPS1 its between family members, friends, or even lovers. It's important to be happy and laughter is just happiness leaving the body to make room for more. Its been a big part for @PERSON1 and I and I'm sure it has been a big part for a lot of other people out their. I couldn't imagine myself being in a relationship with no laughter. It would be very boring and uninteresting. Laughter is the best glue between people.",33.0,6.0
8,"                            Laughter @CAPS1 I was a little girl I didn't know all that much. The only things that I was concerned about were what dresses to put on barbie or what names to give my stuffed animals. I did not know anything about relationships or what things were important to keeping one. As I got older, and more wiser, I realized that the two main things you need, in order to even start a relationship, were a sense of trust and a good sense of humor. After you learn to trust someone, then it's all downhill from there.  Laughter is what keeps things interesting. Without it, people wouldn't be so happy. My family has always had a good sense of humor, and the way some of them laugh, especially my dad, just makes things even more worth laughing over. My dad has always been the funny one in my family. I probably got my sense of humor from his side. My dad and I fight, a lot. We never see eye to eye; we are constantly butting heads. Whenever we have something worth laughing over it seems to bring us a lot closer. I guess you could say that is about the only thing that we have in common. My dad's brother, who is my uncle, has a sense of humor like my dad's. However, I would like to think that my uncle and I are a lot closer than my dad and I are @CAPS2 seems to always be there for me @CAPS1 I need someone the most. @CAPS2 is all ears @CAPS1 it comes to my problems or just play-by-plays of my days. My uncle uses laughter as a cure. Whenever I am down or just upset, @CAPS2 is always there to make me feel better with a laugh or two.  Laughing really does bring everyone closer, in my family at least. My little sister and I have never really got along. Now that she is growing up, she is becoming more distant from me, and I miss being able to just talk to her about anything. Her and I have a weird sense of humor. We find the weirdest and dumbest things the funniest. We could just be watching television and the stupidest commercial would come on. All it takes is for one of us to find it somewhat hilarious and we both start laughing until we almost cry. I guess that's what holds us together. It's not the fighting, arguing, or even the good times; it's all of the laughs that we have shared with each other.  I have always thought that @CAPS1 you lose someone, either because they have disappeared from your life or because they have died, that you wouldn't be able to think of the times that you spent with each other. I am the kind of person who likes to keep everything inside me and not talk about it. I'm kind of a stubborn person. @CAPS1 I was younger my best friend was my grandma. Growing up, I was always over at her house. She taught me a lot about life; especially not to fear anything. She was always very spontaneous and wanting me to try new things. I remember one time, she put a flower in her mouth and sat outside. She told me to do it too, but all I did was look at her like she was crazy. As I watched her sit there, a hummingbird flew up and began sucking nectar from the flower, the flower that was in her mouth! After it flew off I grabbed a flower and sat next to her. @CAPS1 my family moved away, I didn't see her all that much. Ten years had gone by and my family recieved a call. My grandma was very sick. We went and saw her that weekend. Although my grandma was very ill, she still had that glow, and that same smile that always reminded me that it is okay to laugh and not be afraid. I saw her once more after that, the last time.  My grandma taught me about laughter. It is what made us so close. Laughter has been what has made my dad and I closer, and my sister and I still talk.

8," Laughter in @CAPS1 A laugh is not just an action, it is also a meaning or connection. It is universal between countries and people for negative or positive reactions. I believe laughter breaks the tension in awkward positions, brightens a mood, or makes others smile when you laugh, but with the good comes the bad. People can feel outcast, betrayal, or embarrassed when they here laughter from different situations. An example of a negative outcome would be like giving a presentation to your boss for a promotion, when you get nervous you crack a joke to break the tension. Well it can end badly when the boss is to serious and doesn't laugh, then you start stuttering and lose confidence. Or another situation would be if you are a teacher or student passing a group of people in a crowded hallway, you hear your name and then lots of laughter, the assumption is that they are teasing you. Embarrassment is the result of this laughter. Laughter can hurt people if used in the wrong way. Laughter is also used for beneficial reasons. On a first date if he/she is nervous, trying a non-offensive joke might hit their giggle box and make the date a success. When someone is really mad the best way to steer clear of the storm is to make them laugh. Many bad situations can be turned into a good one by a smile, laugh, or a gesture of happiness. It is one of the things the whole human race shares. It unites friends, family, co-workers, bosses (sometimes), and just about everyone. Most people surround themselves with people who are good influences and make them happy. My boyfriend, when i first met him, didn't really smile or laugh at all. I, on the other hand have a very strong sense of humor so what i would laugh at he would look at me like i was crazy, he also looked confused. After three years I have finally come to understand why he was so confused. He didn't have a childhood. I mean that he was a child but he had to take care of himself ever since he was @NUM1 years-old. He only knew how to get satisfaction out of @CAPS1 by force and not by means of enjoyment so when he saw me laugh, he couldn't see how someone could be so happy. It makes my eyes water knowing the hardships he has had to go through but now when I look at him I see happiness and especially hope. He smiles and laughs a lot now. From him i learned a big lesson in @CAPS1 and for only being @NUM2, it is one of the most important so far. The lesson is that, no matter how bad your @CAPS1 is there will always be a better day. Laughter is the key to connections between anyone. It is what makes a day better, a person happier, and our world brighter. There will always be corrupt events happening no matter where you are but if you think about it hard enough you will see the up side to everything. In this world, @CAPS1 is worth living, education is worth learning, and relationships are worth being a part of, for every person, I believe they should have it all.",38.0,6.0
8,"  LAUGHTER @CAPS1 i was younger my friend lived on a ranch and had many horses on it. Almost every weekend i would go over there to hang out with her. @CAPS1 we first started hanging out we were in @NUM1 grade and i never had really ridding a horse before. My first horse that i rode with her was a pony named pretty. She was large for a pony and i loved ridding her. She was especially trained for training beginner, which i was. After a year or so they moved to a different ranch, and the horse that i rode was a @CAPS2 bred named @PERSON2. She was a very gentle horse and i was more experienced with her.  One day @PERSON1 told me that she got rid of @PERSON2 and her and her sister both had got new horses, @ORGANIZATION1 was heathers, and @LOCATION1 was @PERSON1. Heathers horse was a @CAPS3 horse and they have more energy in them then the other horses i ever rode. @PERSON2 was a @CAPS4 and there just hot tempered. We all wanted to go on a trail ride and they didn't have an experienced enough horse for me to ride, besides @ORGANIZATION1, so heather rode this huge horse named cowboy, whose very calm, but is very stubborn @CAPS1 it comes to stopping. @PERSON1 rode her house @LOCATION1 and her mom rode her horse @CAPS5. So i was stuck with @ORGANIZATION1. She wasn't the best horse for beginners, but she was the best out of them all at the time. The first trail we went on was with all of and i had to be tide to @PERSON1 because @ORGANIZATION1 wasn't cooperating at the moment and we all went together. Then @PERSON1 decided that she wanted to go and run around in the pasture with all the other mares. I said i wouldn't mind because i trusted her. We ended up going the back way to the pasture and playing cops and robbers with the horses. It was intense. Once we got in the pasture @PERSON1 found a tarp on the ground and wanted to see if her horse would react. Well she did, @LOCATION1 kept trying to avoid it and stepping on it made loud noises, which had spooked my horse and she almost started rear, and took off towards the gate to leave. I had never been on a horse in full sprint going down a hill and i didn't know what to do, i was holding on with my legs, which seemed to only make her go faster. I started to slide off and i knew i was gonna fall so i just went for it. I had landed on my back and lost my breath. I looked to my side and had noticed all the other horses running towards me. They ended up going around and i was fine.  After that i was afraid to get on her again but @PERSON1 had help me see that if you fall down you need to get back up, also that if you fall of a horse you have to get back on so that they know that your not afraid and that they wont always get what they want. Thinking back to it i laugh a lot and every once in a while me, heather, and @PERSON1 all laugh because it was a very fun time.",32.0,5.0
8," You know how the saying goes live, laugh, love. Laughter is an important part of any relationship you have, laughter is what brings you into people lives with the good times and good memories. Like me and my best friend for an example, i don't think we would be friends with-out all the laughter we bring into each others lives. Every time we are together we can just look at each other and start busting up laughing over nothing, or over previous memories we have had. Laughter is what has brought us closer and closer everyday, and has made our friendship stronger. I believe laughter is what starts any kind of good relationship or friendship.   Laughter is in everyday life i think that there are many good benefits of it, without laughter i think that we all would be lost. Its not just something you always just do when something was funny. Sometimes you can just sit there and laugh at the most stupid things, like something that was just so dumb that it was funny. It brings you and a person closer together because you and another person are laughing at the same things, so you are sharing an interest with the person. Pretty much you are finding out what you and the other person have in common, and finding out they think the same things are funny as you do. It shows that you are happy and that you are the type of person that know how to have fun.  Laughter is one of the most important things in life and in love. It is important in life because it gets you through the hard times sometimes, if someone can make you laugh then it can just makes your day a whole lot better. Its good to laugh because its healthy to be happy in life, and in the things that you do. Its also important in love to, when you laugh you show your partner that you are happy with them and that makes them happy to. If you never laugh they always assume that something is wrong, like your not happy, your sad, or depressed. Laughter is a very important emotion that we all have. It shows and it tell us a lot about the another persons and their personality and what they are like. I personally think that when people fall in love that one of the things they fall in love with is the persons laugh. It makes the other person happy when they know that they can make you laugh and that they can make you happy by doing so. Laughter is an amazing part of life the feeling of being happy and laughing just for that minute or however long it is makes memories you can never forget. With your closest friends you are always bringing up times you had together, reminding each other of what good times you had together laughing at something and couldn't stop. I think that everyone should laugh a little more and live a little more people don't do it often enough. If everyone would just laugh and be happy more i think that there would be way less bad things that people do if everyone just enjoyed life more often.Everyone should just make the best of what they have, and enjoy laughing and spending time with the people closest to you more. After all laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. With all these benefits of laughter it really does help you out in life.     ",39.0,6.0

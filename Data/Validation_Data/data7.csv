But I be patient and wait until @CAPS1 morning. When @CAPS1 morning comes I take a sigh of relief knowing that I’ve been patient all these days and I finally get to open them. Being patient is harder then it seems. Even if you just have to wait five minutes in a traffic jam or even waiting in the lunch line it can get really boring. Then we think everybody has to be patient sometimes so we should just stop and smell the roses and be patient. It will end sooner or later. Being patient can have lots of rewards.

7,"Sometimes being patient is a hard thing to do for some people. Also patience takes a long time to get used to. People who are patient experience difficulties without complaining. Patience is really tough, here is why! Patience is really hard. For example, you are in a waiting room waiting for a docter’s appointment. You are in it for about thirty minutes and you are bored. You want to see your docter right now so you can be done with it and do whatever you want. It has already been forty-five minutes since you walked in the waiting room, you start to become impatient and you start to have a thought of leaving. Just before you walked out the door, the docter calls your name because now he wants to see you. Patience takes a long time to get used to. For example, every appointment you have been to, you have waited about twenty minutes or longer to get started and you have no patience. Now you are stuck in traffic so far for twenty-five minutes and on a scale of one troughten on patience, you are at about nine. Eventually, people who have had no patience in the past can lead to getting used to patience. Patient people experience difficulties without complaining. For example, you are on an airplane ready to fly from @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 to visit relatives. There has been a five minute delay because people are still packing langege in the plane.

I looked up to see my uncle so patient, I said to him, “Are you ready?” @CAPS5 reply, “Of course you little wimp.” I gave a nasty glare. One, two, were almost there. I stood, with my arms crossed. “@CAPS6 fasten your seatbelts, keep hands on bars. Do not unfasten seatbelt during ride. Here we go. “The controller guy said to the people who went on.

The first letter we did was uppercase @CAPS2. to make it simple I first told him to draw a straight line. That of course was simple for him. Then I showed him how to make the @CAPS3 bumps. It took about @NUM3 tries but I was very patient with him and he eventually got it. The @CAPS4 was pretty simple for him because it was only one long line and three shorter ones. He finished that in about @NUM4. Then came the @CAPS5. I told him to draw a line then slanted one and then another line going up and down.

But I said, “@CAPS1 don’t we play mad libs!” it was a great idea and everyone go into it. After that are flight was finally here. “yes!” I shouted. We all loaded the plan and off we went.

That’s all just a plain passing grade. So to make that passing grade happen I made him practice for an extra two hours. I could tell he was getting mad at me. He kept rolling his eyes and muttering to himself but I still didn’t give up. After school I invited him over to see his grade on the test. When he got here he had a sad look on his face. Rigt away I looked him on the eyes and cried,” oh @CAPS3 I’m sorry I knew you worked hard on the test and that’s all that matters. All of a sudden he started laughing. He showed me his test it hadt an A on it. “You tricked me,” I screamed. I didn’t know if I should hug him or punch him. That day he gave me a letter. In it was a ten dollar bill.

Not the blanket,saddle, grooming-@CAPS1-of all things, it’s the bit on the bridle.Sometimes he will open the mouth and take the bit, @CAPS3 @CAPS2 of the time I have to wait and be patient untill he understands I don’t want to hurt him. First, I’ll  lift the bridle up  high ennough so the bit is just touching  @LOCATION1’s lips. Then, I stide my thumb in the corner of his lips so he opens his mouth and I can slip the bit right in. (@CAPS2 of the time he sticks his tongue out and forces the bit out of his mouth or I don’t line the bit up with his teeth correctly.) @CAPS3, I’ve discovered that if i force him to take his bit,neither one of us learn,we just get frustrated with each other,That was when i discovered that patience is the key to understanding. Besides,you will get better results with patience and understanding  than you do with fear. For example, if I pet and groom him while I’m bridling him,he  takes the bit easily. As opposed to getting mad and makin g him take the bit. (That just ruins our bond and relationship, @CAPS4 makes him afraid of the bit).This is how I use patience in my everyday life and how being  patient with someone gives u better result.",19.0,6.0

7,To me patience is time. You need to know how to spair time and relax. For example: if you need to go the the bathroom and the teacher say no you need to know how to calm your self down and spair time. To be patience you need to know how to be calm and how to not get frustrated and you need to times how to control you anger. That is what patient means to me.,14.0,5.0

7,One time I was patient is when I was at the doctors. At the doctors it takes forever to get called up then you would go in a room and wait for the doctor. In the room there is nothing to do except sit there it is just a plain room.

7,Patients is when you are focusing of listening and being quiet.  But when it comes to me I just want to get it done and over with. I mean I just want to scream at the people and and tell them to hurry up. But I will just have to wait and try to be patient. But I am unpatient because of my dad because I want to be just like him when im older.

All of us were going crazy with anger and anxiety but we survived. We were almost an hour away after a while when my dad missed a turn which made the trip much longer. My dog by now puked twice and I really had to use the bathroom. I was about ready to scream but my dad announced we were thirty minutes away, which calmed everyone in the veh except my dog.

That night my dad went on line and had me look at a whole bunch of different guitars. I said look I like that blue tinted acoustic guitar and it is only one-hundred and fifty dollars. Then it was time for bed so I down stairs and took a left to get to my scooby-doo bedroom to go to sleep. The next day I was going over to my friend @CAPS2 house to spend the night thinking my dad would have the guitar there when I get back but it was never there.

7,"A person I know that has a incredible amount of patience would have to be @PERSON1. He's the only science teacher for @NUM1 and @NUM2 graders. He is a really good guy once you get to know him more. The reason I think @PERSON1 has patience is because us as students are really loud and energetic all the time. I should know when our class is overly energetic, it's really noticeable. This is @PERSON1's first year teaching at @LOCATION1 crest charter @CAPS1. We are highly annoying at times and sometimes I get spaz attacks from my classes. Usually teachers will say ''@CAPS2 down!'' or ''shush!'' or something like that. @PERSON1 isn't one of those @CAPS3, he'll just stand still and cross his arms while looking at us. He never told us what that meant, but as times passed on we found out by ourselves, I don't think I have ever heard him shout at us or be really mad about it. In fact @PERSON1 hasn't even complained about it. Not even once have I heard him! Today during the meap, @PERSON3 said we could get a snack from our lockers quietly. @CAPS4 we did get our snacks from our lockers. But not quietly like he said or told us. @CAPS4 he just gave us the posture he makes when were loud, then we sat quietly for our next part of the meap. I'm really happy @PERSON1 is our home room teacher because he has a good sence of humor and he is also very understanding every single day. I think all teachers (including @PERSON1) have a huge amount of patience if I should say @CAPS4 my self. Right now, every body is either working hard and quietly on their meap or they are reading a book silently to themselfs. I can't hear @CAPS3 talking to each other @CAPS4 that means the class is silent. I don't know how this class would end up without @PERSON2 I know for a fact that @PERSON1 is awesome because he has good sence of humor, smart, and he knows how to keep us on the ball. @CAPS4 I know that @PERSON1 is one of the most patient person I know @CAPS4 far. He's always in a good mode and I've never seen him have a bad side. @CAPS4 he's a  awesome guy! Go @PERSON1",24.0,8.0

7,I have been patient so many times in the past years. Just last year I had to be patient for a whole year. The reason I had to be patient for a whole year was because I had just started school and I allready wanted it to be @DATE1. I've learned that patient was a good thing. It was good because it helped me be more focused instead of staring at the clock or calander. There were so many times that I wanted it to be @DATE1 allready and wanted to complaine to the teachers why the school years were so long. It was hard not to complaine but I stayed patient and waited for the school year to end. It finally ended and I did not complaine once.

There was one problem, a young ten year old was sitting in it. We politely asked him to move but he put up a fight battling for a seat that wasn’t his. Finally, he gave up and just walked away to another seat. I wanted to say so much and tell him off, but I knew that wouldn’t be a polite thing to do. I bet he was just cranky by being @NUM2 obiously it was past his bed time. Then we took off. That took a solid four hours. To keep me busy, I colored with my coloring book that I snak.

With patientey  then you will gain lots of respect and appreceation from others in your life time. Without patience you will lose respect and appreciation from others. I would really hate to have that happen to me. Your life will get worse & worse if that happen. If you are ever in any kind of argument, don’t just start to flip out and spuzz out, just calm yourself down, say “ we need to end this I’m sorry”, then you can just pick a new topic, and move on.

You will have lots of friends and lots of good people in your life. Just always have patience and respect for those in your life, and life will just end fine. I know know that some times it’s hard to not scream at the person your fighting with and let them have it. That won’t get you anywhere in life, but just staying calm and not dying mad all the time, now trust me, that will most deffinently get you to good places and situation in life.",15.0,5.0

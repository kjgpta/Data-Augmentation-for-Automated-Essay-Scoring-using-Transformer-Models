2,"Do u believe there are books, music, magizines, and movies in are libaries? These meterials could consist of nude pictures and so on. Most parents do not want to see there kids getting a hold of this type of material. You maybe think 'what could  we do about this things, or least come to a compermise to make almost everyone happy. I have so reasons why we should put this type of material away from kids sight and reach.     First of all, the books and magizines that have any nude in them, should have their own section and, be labled aduts only. I know this might be alot of work but it is needed, so kids aren't aloud to go in ths section. This will help ruduce what little kids see. There are also books and magizines that are offensive to children of a different race. These books should be removed from the shelves also because they hert peoples feelings, and this might make customers leave your libary. I am not saying ouhae to take ever single book of your selves, but a least reduce the number of books of your selves out of kids eyes mostly and some adults if they are offended.          Next thing that comes to mind is the music on compacked discs, or cd's which ever you perfere.  In this day and age there are alot of musicians out there that have alot of bad words in their songs. These songs; are songs parents dont like there children to listen to, because parents are afraid of their children here these words and repeating them at home. These type of cd's should be taken of shelves where kids are, and put in a section also labled adults only. I know this wont stop kids from hearing these words and say them, but at least the parents can blame you for their child saying these words, because you did the smart thing and put these cd's out of kids reach. There are songs that are ofensive to people but i know you cant go throught every song and take them off the shelves, but a least take the cd's off the shelve that you know are offensive to people.     The last that comes to mind that should be taken off the shelves that are material children shouldnt see is the movies. There are movies out there that are to graphic, to vilent, and to much nudity that kids dont need to see. These type of movies need to also get a section that is for adults only. Then you have the movies that need to just be taking off the shelve because they are to offensive to some viewers. I know that you @MONTH1 say but if it is offensive to them, they dont have to get it. This maybe true but a least move the to a section that those people that get offended dont go.     Those were my thoughts on what should be done with material thats to offensive and not aprobriet for eyes or minds.These might be a little extreme but i hope you at least take some of these things into consideration. You cant please all but you can try. Thanks for reading this and i hope it as changed your thoughts on material thats bad for kids to see",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I strongly believe that there are some materials that should not be allowed on the shevles. There are things in this world that kids should not see for a long time. If there are things that are offensive on the shelves, then kids can read it and it could lead to bad things.     When you enter a library, you don't want to see something that is very offensive. For example, one time my friend and I walked in to the library and the first thing we saw was a book about inappropiate things. We were young so that was the last thing we wanted to see. It was a horrible thing to see and I feel that no child should have to see that when they go into a library.     You can never unsee things. No parent wants their children going into a library and reading things they shouldn't. It @MONTH1 have an affect on their childrens behavior and future. If a child went into a library and began reading a book about drugs it could hurt their future. If the book was telling them that drugs aren't always bad, then that kid @MONTH1 grow up thinking it is okay to do drugs. This could really ruin someones life. I know that this @MONTH1 not always be true,but it could be in some cases.      If I was to walk into a library today, there probably wouldn't be to many things found offensive. I feel that as the years go on, there are less inappropriate things found on the shelves at libraries because people ask them to remove the book if it is offensive. If I was to find something bad there I would ask them to remove it from the shelf. I believe that everyone should have the right to remove a book from the shelf if it is offensive. I also think that eveyone would need a good reason to remove it because eventually there wouldn't be very many books left on the shelves.      I believe that these are all very good reasons to removes offensive books off the shelves at libraries. I hope that most would agree that no one should have to see these offensive books when they enter a library.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Do you think that certain books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves in a library if found offensive?Sometimes they should if found offensive by alot of people.Sometimes books are found offensive by a few people and the books should not be band. Sometimes books are found offensive by alot of people and they should be band.Sometimes no matter what library's do not band the books.     We have freedom to keep those books in the library.We also have the freedom to say what is offensive to us in those   books .wh should band some books and some should not be band. some people think we should band books .i think books should be band too because they can be found offensive to some people.     They @MONTH1 be offended by racist things in books.Murder books they @MONTH1 take offensive.Books about @CAPS1 they @MONTH1 take offenive.If i had a young daughter i would not read this stuff at all. Because she does not need to be reading those books.     Little kids do not need to be reading that bad books.I thinks that all little boys and girls should not read those things. They should stay sweet and inisent. Young boys and girls should read books for little kids. Little kid books are for kids and the other books are for adults.     We should band some books because they can be found offensive to some people.  Some people do not like to be offended. Some people are not offended. Books that people find offensive should be band and those books should not be read.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship in libraries should definetly be allowed. It is history for everyone in the world to know. Sure it @MONTH1 bug some people that stuff like that is being written about them; however, they probably read material about you like that as well. How is that fair? Words in the library are just people's opinions about other people, groups, or other things.      Sure there are facts about what that group or person did, but that's history. People need to know what happened in the past so they can move on in the future. Books about slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to blacks, but now that people have read about it and what it caused, they realize how inhumane and bad it is. It's necesarry information to learn. People who get mad at libraries for carrying that material in their books just can't let go of the past or they care too much about what other people think.     As far as movies and music go, they are just informative videos about @LOCATION1's history, and music is for entertainment. You can't take all things you see hear in a literal way. They are not meant to be taken in an 'in your face' sort of way. It's not like there isn't another movie out there making fun of the one that offended you. Libraries carry this reading/learning material to help inform the less than average person or the more than average so they can both become smarter.       Libraries aren't made to make people angry about what some guy thought or said once. It is just a place to gain knowledge. If you don't want to let your child have access to information like that then I suggest that you don't let them go to the library ever. That's is what it was made for and will always be made for. Yeah the person who wrote that book or movie @MONTH1 not have gotten their information from a reliable source and said some false things about a group or person. It happens. But they are stilling trying to educate the reader. Education is what makes our world survive. We have to keep learning and the library makes that oppurtunity available with all the information it holds.      Libraries should keep every book that they have. If people take offense to it, read something else. There are far too many opinions in this world to take one person's and get mad about it. Libraries are centers of education. They hold the information to our past and possibly our future. If we are willing to learn about what happened and accept it. Once again, it's not meant to cause anger among groups or people. So do what you do best and keep writing stories you hear about in the news or anywhere. It's good information that is informative.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Many books are helpful as you @MONTH1 know by now, but taking away books that are found, 'offensive' is repulsive. I believe that these books, movies, music, magazines, should be kept on the shelves. There are many reasons for keeping these books for the public, one main one is that who ever has a membership to the library paid to see everything.     These books that are found offensive to some @MONTH1 not be offensive to others, heres an example, lets say there is a recovering alcoholic and this person is flipping through a magazine and they see a alcoholic beverage ad in the magazine. This would be offensive to them but to the person next to him that collects fine wines its not offensive to him. This is all a matter of opinion, another example, there is a magazine that comes in that has a ammo add and one of the librarians finds it bad, but the others like to hunt game and they find it helpful to read an ad about ammounition for their next vacation to alaska.     As i said before it is all a sense of oppinions. Its one persons oppinion aganist others and its a never ending cycle, and its never going to stop. Basically this censorship is a game of he said , she said, and it is not fair to the people to take something away just because a few people do not like it.     Some people found racial profiling offensive others did not, some people seen what @CAPS1 @CAPS2 was doing was right, others didnt. Everyone has an opinion and everyone will express theirs no matter what its about, why they say it, and how you or anyone else feels, and that is how it will be until the end of time, and thats life. So holding books back just because a group of peoples opinion is outragous! This is a free country and we should be able to know that by not having people hide stuff just because a slight offense is brought into play.     This is my opinion on this matter and some @MONTH1 take offense to it, just hear me out when i say why let someone tell you what you can and cant read? Thats just wrong. Thank you for taking time to read what i had to say about this matter, and just understand the right to opinnions and how everyone has one and will express it.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Should good books be taken off the shelf because their not appropriate for @PERSON1 children? Should libraries be only child friendly? Censorship in public libraries isn't the answer to solve the problem with children in desiding on what books they want to explore. Public libraries have the title 'public' for a reason. Taking good books off shelves, that @MONTH1 not be good books for @PERSON1 children, instead should be catagorized in sections for @PERSON1 children, pre-teens, teenagers, and adults.     I beleive that censorship of libraries would be a very ignorant idea. Not to mention that it would create an uproar in the public tax payers. I don't beleive tax payers would appreciate that their tax money isn't going toward things that actually matter. A lot of the public @MONTH1 like those books and other media sources that's being taken away, @CAPS1 some @MONTH1 find the books offensive, but that dosen't mean that they have to get rid of the book, when they can just put the book down.     I do beleive that everyone should have a say in their public libraries to improve them, not disprove them. @PERSON1 children should be restricted from the sections that are not appropriate for their age and should be rederected to locations of sections that are appropriate for their age.     Censorship on this subject means sealing other ideas off and away from the public eyes. Some of those ideas can educate people very well with quality knowledge or not, but are brain candy and just are fun to read.      If people like Paterson are concerned about what @PERSON1 readers can read and uptain, they should be monitering what their children are reading and allow them or not, not the libraries. The libraries just carry the book.     Books that are offensive @MONTH1 show the reader new and interesting ideas. Some for example like 'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' show what life was like in that time. And even if the book has offensive language for @PERSON1 children means that it should be correctly cattegorized",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"A huge issue came to my attention today as I went to the library. I went to the computers to see if my favorite book available. The computer showed that the book was taken off the shelf for offending readers. I checked another list that listed numerous books, music, movies, and magazines that were also taken off of the shelves. Half of the list, I had checked out already. The librarian said the council is voting to take or not take specific books, music, movies, and other items off of the shelves for offensive content. As a regular library customer, I felt I needed to express my opinion of the topic. I believe that before these materials are taken off of the shelves that the librarians need to consider an age limit, a 'three strikes your out' rule, or how much these materials mean to people.     Offending people is not what these materials are meant to do. Some books can be perceived in that way which makes the readers angry. I can understand someone's feelings being hurt by a certain topic of reading, but that person @MONTH1 not be mature enough to comprehend what the book is intending as a message. My sister who is the age of ten has read a book which offended her, but she also didn't know what the book really was about. I believe that anyone the age of sixteen or older should be allowed access to these books, music, movies, and magazines. Age sixteeen is when most people are already in high school and more mature. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be allowed access to these items. If the readers are mature enough to handle the material, then people @MONTH1 not be offended as much.     Another new rule the library could try is the 'three strikes you're out rule.' @CAPS1 rule is when someone behaves inappropriately. Some people who behave inappropriately will tell everyone the book is offensive and make up stories about the book so their friends will laugh. Each person receives a strike every time they behave inappropriately. @CAPS1 includes in a school classroom as well as the library. After a certain amount of strikes, that person wouldn't be allowed to check out the material. The librarians could keep a record of @CAPS1 which could be accessed whenever. Even if the person is of age to check out the material, they couldn't do so if they had a certain amount of strikes on their record.     These materials mean a great deal to people. I am an avid reader as well as movie watcher. When I read a book, I feel like I have freedom. No one is telling me I perceive the book wrong, or that isn't what the character would look like. Reading a book is my own imagination making up the pictures of the story in my head. Taking these items off of the shelves takes away people's immagination. It also takes away from the writers freedom of speech in the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. The writers wrote their book under that @CAPS2 and now there freedom is basically being taken away from them by taking there speech off of shelves.     Overall, I believe that these materials shouldn't be taken off of the shelves. The librarians should consider either making up new rules or thinking about people's opinions of the subject. The librarians should also consider the freedom of speech rule when they are taking these materials off of the shelves. If they don't consider any of these options, then all offensive materials would be taken away. One person could say a book or movie is offensive and it would be taken off of the shelf. After awhile, the library would eventually become empty. What would be left to check out?",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Have you ever went to the library and picked up a book that you thought was good?     Well some people pick books by the way the cover looks,some pick it by what it says on the back,But some people pick it by what kind of book it is.If every librarian took the books off the shelf that were offensive, there would be barely any left.Just because the book is offensive doesn't mean that it's a bad book,and that doesn't mean that your not goin to learn something out of it because it's offensive.     I do not believe that certain books should be taken off the shelf just for the kind of material that it is.If other people don't like the material in the book then they don't have to read it.Some people learn things from lessons that are learned the hard way.So maybe if they didn't like the book because of the way it was written,they should read it anyways.Offensive books can teach people lessons about how other things in the world are.     Not everything that people read is going to be nice.Just like everything in the world isn't nice but we deal with it anyways.There's always going to be a really offensive person in the word,but you can't just take them off the shelve becuase that person is mean or you don't like what he's saying.If we killed every offensive person in the world, there would be barely any people left.     So i don't agree with taking every book off the shelf that's offensive.There is always going to be something offensive out there in the world,and we can't just get rid of everything that we think needs to go because it's offensive.That would make no sense.Not every thing's nice and sugarcoated,you have to see other parts of the world too,and i think that taking offensive books off the shelf is not the right way to go.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I believe by my beliefs alone, that nothing should be removed from the library just because someone finds the material offensive in anyway possible. So my answer is no, no books, music, movies, magazines should be banned from the library because one person, or mabye the majority of people find it offensive. There is no reason to tarnish anyone elses reading, listening, or watching anything of their interest because others find it offensive. The solution that could solve all this, is for the people that find them offensive, can just completely ignore that material.I can understand by my own experiences how people can find such materials a problem though. For an example, I've read books, listened to music, watched movies, even read magazines that were offensive too me. The biggest problem that occurs in those materials to make them offensive, is usually racism. Most people can deal with it though, so if they can you should be able to, right? As I have stated before, just because you don't like it does not mean that you should disapprove of it. If you disapprove of it and get the material removed from the library then the others who liked it, won't be able to read, listen, nor watch it.The statement I'm making here, is me pretty much saying that onless you only care about yourself, then sure report about it.If you are not a person that only cares of yourself, then you would let the book stay even though you don't like it, because others @MONTH1 like it. My observations of this sort of thing is I've seen people complain how they've read this book, and it was racist towards their well-being. From my own personal readings I've understood that many people have a lot of pride for themselves of who they are and what they are. People need to understand though, it was written by someone else.You @MONTH1 judge, but out of your own respect, should not report to remove of something for their ideas.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Here is what I think about materials being removed from the shelves if they are offensive. I think that some people have different things they like to read and listen to. Someone might like a certain type of book, and another might think it's offensive. So what do you do about this situation?     Yes, there might be some books that could be offensive to people if they are about certain things. What if a little kid is in the adult area looking at books and they find a book they shouldn't have seen? Well most parents would want those books to be removed from the library. There could also be books that are just offensive to adults because of what they are about. I've seen people at my library get offended by something they read and they didn't want it back on the shelf.     What if there are some @CAPS1's that a little kid checks out and it has language in the music? I don't think that any of that music should be in the library at all. Especially with little kids roaming the library. The music in the library could be offensive to other people to. Not just young kids.      When you walk into a library usually the first thing you see are magazines. There can be some pretty inapropriate magazines with inapropriate covers. Is this really what you want people looking at? Especially young kids?      There are also movies at a library. Yes, most of them are old movies, but some of them are also kids movies. What if one of those old movies had a bad cover on it, or bad language? A lot of movies are also offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3. I think this because, back in the old days there was a lot of racism, and that is still in alot of movies now. There could also be movies against someones religion. That could be very offensive to certain people.     Most of this stuff in libraries can be offensive to young kids because of the covers. Some can be offensive to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of racism. I think that if you have a problem with something that you see on a shelf, you should tell the librarian and see if they will take it off the shelf. You shouldn't have to be offended by something at the library. I think that people should have their rights to get certain materials off of the shelf. Especially if they think it's offensive to them, or anybody else that might happen to see the same thing. Is this really what we want in our libraries is offensive materials? Just remember to think about what you put on the shelves at your public library",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I think books, movies or magazines should be aloud in libraries. Some people @MONTH1 not beleive in this, maybe there is a solation to help this problem. And this way is to keep all these in the library.      Some people @MONTH1 need to learn these (offensive) books or moives, so how else are they going to be able to research them? The people that are affended by these need to try and avoid them as much as possible. There are other ways to avoid things you don't want to see or read.     A way to resolve this problem is that there should be a adult section. This way people @MONTH1 be expecting offensive thing's a little more. And people can be more meture about it and if they see something they don't like to just set it back down.     How well we know what is offensive and what is'nt? Well every person is differnt to the next person. This is way I think books should be left where they are. If everyone picks a book we think is offensive I believe there well not be many books left to read.      People have rights, and by that you can read watch whatever you want. And if you don't like it don't watch or read it. Maybe the next that comes along will enjoy it.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books,music,movies,magazines,etc.,should be removed from the shelvesif they are found offensive?      No, I think that it should not be removed because other people will like to learn about the things that the shelves would be offering to the public.if the people don't like what they see it should be a certain area that warn people that they might get offended so enter at your own risk.     Secondly, people should know what they are walking into in a library because they have signs that let you know what topic is what and where they are located,so if people walk into a section knowing they might get offended it would be there own fault and nobody else's.     Last but not least. If someone gets hurt it will most likely be about religion and that is basically a sign within its own name saying someone might get hurt so do not be so quick to jump into the topic or section you are going to look at.     In conclusion I think that materials such as books,music,movies,magazines,etc should not be removed.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I will persuade you to agree with me on why somethings need to be sensored at the library.  And why somethings do not need to be sensored at the library.  I will help you to understand what young teenagers or younger children should and should not be able to see or borrow from the library.      There are somethings that should be kept from the kids eyes.  What are some of the movies, books, or magazines that should be hidden from children? This is probably what you are woundering.  The first thing that kids should not be allowed to borrow would be movies that have any that is over there age requirement to see at the movie theather.  The reason this is so that the teenager or young child does not watch anything that @MONTH1 scary them.  Another thing that should not be seen would be the movies that are meant for a mature veiwer meaning an adult viewer.  There are a few books that kids should not be able to read until they are an adult.  And these books would be the ones that have a harsh backround on past events that happened.  Like what happen during a war to a captured soldier or a prisoner of war.  And what they to go through during their imprisonment.  These are the books that should be hidden from younger childern.     There are some movies, books, music, magazines that do not need to be sensored for people to see.  Starting with why some movie do not need to be sensored.  First is because most movies are funny but have just a little need of maturity.  These movies are the ones that have alot of comedy and as most adults know most kids are into the funny movies.  So why take away a movie that is something a kid would have a great time watching.  There are some books that should probably be read by adults but there are some teenagers that are mature enough to read this stories.  Or if they need to learn about a specific topic for school work they should be allowed to read that book.  I do not think that any genre or group of music should be sensored.  This because music is a way for someone to express themselves without even having to truely say anything.  about who they are or what kind of a mood they are in.  music does much more then just that though it helps some people vent on there anger or even how sad they @MONTH1 be.       But in conclusion I think there are many things that are good but still need to be sensored for most of the young childern and teenagers to be able to see.  And on the other hand there are alot of good things that do not need to be sensored like music and book and even certain magazines.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that everyone in our town should have the same right to check out books, music, movies ect. I also believe that libraries should put the ratings on the side of every book, music, movies etc, so that parents and care takers can see what type of books and music their child is checking out from our local library.               You have to remeber our local library has a very braud selection to choose from and there are some books and music in our library that I dont think are very sutible for our younger children.          Then again I think the children should be reading on there own level, but for that to happen we would have to trust our children to know what kind of material they should be looking at and what they shouldnt be looking at. Alot of younger kids come into the library not even knowing how to read and go right to the advanced section just to be cool, the library is not a place to come to act cool. Its for learning new things and advancing your reading level. If things keep going the way they are all of our books will be gone except for all the little kid books becuase those are the only things that dosnt get checked out. so please local library  would you please think about puting rating labels on the cover of everything in the library so we can put some order into this place.

2,"Dear newspaper, we all know that everyone will that persons will find something that is offensive to them. No matter who that person is we all have something that is offensive to us and thats that. This does not mean we need to take books off the shelves of libraries that some author spent his time an money on.     Books in libraries are either in there for informational use or just to hear a good story. No author is going to try an offend any one in anything thier writting. Why would they do that if they want their book to be well liked and bought? Truth is no one wants to be offended or talked about in a hastily way.     There is no need for censorship  in libraries. Libraries were made for educational information, history, and non-fiction tales to please our minds. If we censored all of this how would we learn what's good, what's bad, and what's acceptable in life. If a book, movie, magazine, or music is to graphic or not apropriate for that person then they should just not look at it or view it.     It's clear that every human being is different and special in their own way. We all have our own idea on what we think is right, wrong, and just plain offensive. No human on this earth is perfect, we can't decide or know what will be offensive to another. And if something is offensive, you just have to be the bigger person and go on with life",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"For many years, libraries have been allowed to put certain books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelves that could be considered offensive.  I believe they should allow these certain category of books, movies, and magazines to be allowed, however to an extent.  Libraries should open up an area for people above the age of @NUM1 to view this material with a special membership.       Books and magazines in libraries are, and should be seperated by categories.  The books and magazines that could be considered 'highly offensive,'  do not belong on the library shelves at all.  However, books and magazines that give out informative data with proper conduct should be allowed.  If libraries create an area in which peoples' prefrences are to view content over the age of @NUM1, they should be required to have their own membership.  In order to even look at material that is uncensored, visitors need a special pass; this way people who get offended by material that is not censored do not have to pass it while inside the library.       Many people who do not want to go out and spend @MONEY1 on a movie rental like to go to the library.  Libraries should allow movies from the ranges of ratings @CAPS1(@CAPS2) to @CAPS3(@CAPS4) to be on the shelves of the library.  Going into a public library should not have any more restrictions that going into a public video store.  However, videos that are considered 'pornography,' should not be in any part of the library.  Just like in a public video store, libraries should not contain any footage that is considered pornography.       Much of the popular music today is considered offensive.  The music in libraries can still be the same songs, but they need to have clean content in them.  I believe that edited music in libraries is okay under any circumstances.  I do not believe that explicit music is okay.  People inside the library could be listening to this explicit music before they take it home, while others in the library get offended by it.  People overhearing music would not happen often, but we need to make sure it does not happen at all.       Overall, material in libraries that could be considered offensive should not be allowed to be viewed except under special memberships that have proof that an individual is over the age of @NUM1.  We all need to work together to make sure our libraries stay clean and unoffensive.  Libraries are some peoples resort to peacefulness, so lets keep it that way, and respect the feelings of others",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Absolutly not this is a free country. It is basically the same thing as freedom of speech. If someone finds the material offensive then they shouldnt read it! Sure im sure libraries in communist countries take books off the shelves, but that's because theyre communist! If you take away freedoms of people then eventually our counrty will become one of those communist countries nobody wants.     Why would anyone not be able to read a good book its a story. Music is music no matter what they say in the lyrics, and movies if you get rid of movies well then whats the @LOCATION1 coming to certainly not a free country. I enjoy all kinds of different movies. Lets see I like dramas, comedys, horror, and action movies they're all great! So what if its a little rasict or sextist all its doing is telling a story. Same with music I love songs my favorite genres are hip hop, classic, and country. Books I do not like very much but some people do so you have to keep them.     So if you ask me people that want to take books, movies, and music out of libraries to protect people then that means your just trying to protect yourself. Maybe a section in the library should be made saying these books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. I do agree with that because some people really dont know what theyre about to read, listen to, or watch. So that is my conclution on this topic.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"@CAPS4 I do agree on removing offensive or negative books from the shelf. Music, books, magazines, or even movies should be atleast vision proof, in other words fix everything so kids can watch or read to.          Music, is a very popular trend on the world now. Everybody listens and feed into it, but some music and also lead to problems. You know how most songs can be played and have alof of 'negative' lyrics? Well I believe that can be fix, because not everything you say do not have to be with a vulgar word or end with one. Music is not about '@CAPS1, @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3', music suppose to make you feel good inside or maybe even down in some people cases, but music is a positive fact and people do not suppose to turn something positive into negative.          Books are influencional on me because I like to read, I enjoying reading books that I can relate to and understand cause most people can read something and not understand a thing. As little kids we all were tought to pick up a book and read but as we get older we fall off, but what people do not know is, books help develop your reading and vocabulary skills. Even if you read a magazine, anything would help as long as your reading something. Magazines are basically about the world, celebritys and how the media react, but like a book a magazine do not stick with one topic.     Movies especially movies are a big deal in the world. If you havent notice what ever kids/teenagers/ and maybe even adults see in movie they eventually going to do it. All movies should be @NUM1 which mean, everybody could see. People fail to realize movies are not reality, what you see in movies you can not do in reality, it might be base on real stuff but its not. I love movies and im sure everybody else do to but they should really vision proof it.          In conclusion, @CAPS4 we should take the offensive stuff form the shelf just for the childeren stake.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"If anything the libraries should never take book from the shelf because someone does not like it. That would make someone who really like the book that they took alway upset. Libraries are suppose to have books that everyone can read and learn from, so if they don't have books for everyone the library should'nt be there. I disagree with removing certain material from the library and here is why.     First, the reason why i would'nt remove certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., because the library is a place where people come to learn about new things. Just because one person does'nt like the book does'nt make it right for them to remove it. If people don't wont their children to read the book don't let them go to the library. They go buy their child some good books to read.     Also, no one would want to go to a library that does'nt have what they are looking for. That would'nt be a good look for the library, because if someone goes there and find that all the books their looking for is not in and this is the only library in town they would never want to go back there again. Then they would tell moe people about how that library does'nt have anything your looking for in it.     Then, the library would get old close down then get knocked down, and in the shot were the library use to be would be a mini mall, food store, ect. so i really don't think it's a good idea to take book off the shelves at the libraries. We need those books because you never know when something can come up and you need that one book that is not there.     In conclusion, removing books from the shelves is a bad thing to do. No matter what people think about the books the person who made it made it for a reason thats why he/she is a writer.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I believe that certain books and other things should be removed from the shelves because, those offensive things are getting to the little kids heads. Kid's reading offensive things and seeing offensive things will hurt them due to them still learning basic things in life. Once when I was little, I picked up and read a book about drugs and sex. They talked about how they feel, where you can get them from, and what they looked like. For a minor reading on how to get drugs and use them, that's telling them to much.        It is not a good thing to tell kid's so early in their life about drugs because, they are going to get curious about how the drugs feel. When I was told about drugs I was very curious and I wanted to learn more about them. The older and boring we become the more we will want to try the drugs we learned about earlier in our lives. More people every day try drugs because there is nothing else to do. When I learned about sex while being a kid made me want to try it because they made it sound good in books.         Being teached offensive things in libraries is a bad thing because, who would think something bad could be in a library? You go to the library to learn good things about life and if their are offensive things in books and in writing you will pick them bad things up in your life. For all minors do not read nothing about drugs, sex, or anything that does not have to do about education or life.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"While reading a book do you ever think that kids shouldnt be allowed access to reading this, especially not for a public library? If they think that book is too offensive should they be allowed to take it off the shelf? Should they just complain to the librarian? Some people will have very different opinions when answering these questions. What's the right answer though?     The way I see it, they should not be allowed to take it off of the shelf. Everyone has different interests. People @MONTH1 read one specific type of book and only that type. Others will read all types. Some people @MONTH1 think that books are too scary, violent, or sexual. Others @MONTH1 enjoy the thrill in them and want to read these books. There are many ways in which a book could be inappropriate. This, however, does not mean libraries should have censorship. Libraries should have sections that are age appropriate. That way if a book is too bad in some way then the mature audience would read it and an audience that should be reading children's books would not be in that section.      Another reason they should not be allowed to take books off of shelves is because it's disrespectful to the author. The author took a long time creating their book aimed towards a specific audience. For someone to take it off a shelf and ruin peoples chances for being able to read that is awful and it should not be allowed. Taking a book off of the shelf is like and author coming up and destroying all of the hard work you have worked for.     Many people might find a book that is very inappropriate and want it to be disposed of but as you can see, its not right. There would be no books left on the shelves. It would be very disrespectful to destroy an authors hard work. People have a choice in what they read and we should not take that away",3.0,4.0,6.0

2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exaclty the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  -@ORGANIZATION1 quote moves mountians with its wisdom. In @ORGANIZATION1 day and age, many of the things we read/see in magazines, movies, the news etc. are considered to be quite offensive to many. Would a mother of a fifteen year old be upset if @CAPS5 found her daughter reading a magazine that stated, 'safe sex is great sex', or a father finding his teenage son watching a movie with pornographic scenes? The answer is no. The magazines, movies, music and books that are being sent out into libraries all over the world are not exactly '@CAPS1 rated' and many adults would be shocked to realize exactly what it is teenagers are viewing; but is it right to then remove everything some one finds to be wrong or offensive?     Lets think about religion for a second. Atheists would find the bible to be a lie, maybe even find it offensive. So in turn to be considerate of their beliefs does that make it 'right' to remove the bible from libraries and open access to the public? Think about the novel, 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4'. English scholars around the world will state that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a novel of its time; that it will continue to be read hundreds of years from now at schools around the world. Some though, would find @ORGANIZATION1 book offensive. The word 'nigger' is placed in @ORGANIZATION1 novel many times and is set in a time when slavery is not frowned apon. Just because one parent finds @ORGANIZATION1 book to be offensive does that mean students from all over should no longer be allowed to read it; that @ORGANIZATION1 book should be 'removed from the shelves?'     The questions posed here are not simple questions, they require much time and thought. If a survey was posted asking: Should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? The outcome would be intangible to think about now, considering people have many different views on the aspect.      In reading @ORGANIZATION1 and contemplating the questions asked you will realize that @ORGANIZATION1 is not a black or white concept; there lies a large area of grey in the middle. Something that one @MONTH1 find offensive, another would not; something a teenager views as interesting an adult @MONTH1 view as crude or vulger. Does @ORGANIZATION1 mean that everything would be taken down from the shelves then? Yes.     In the quote above by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS5 states,      '.. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 is correct in @ORGANIZATION1 because @CAPS5 realizes that everyone has different views on what is appropriate or not. @ORGANIZATION1 statement shows that although libraries @MONTH1 allow inappropriate novels, magazines, tapes etc. to be open to the easy access of customers there is no way that they would be able to make everyone feel content without completely wiping out the building of its contents. The right to take a book away also is a right to leave it; leave the books then and let the ones who enjoy them, simply enjoy.",4.0,4.0,7.0

You just want to throw the book away or call the artist of the song and ask them what they was thinking!

The way you like something is all based on opinions and how you think.     Everyone is different. Even if its by skin color, religon, age, where you live. We are all different.

Your taking away privelages of everyone else, keeping them from wonderful stories and lyrics. Would you want someone to take away your favorite book or song? No, and neither would anyone else in this world.     I agree with Katherine Paterson, everthing would be gone in the end if we had the power to take something away that we didn't like.

Now moveis, muics, and maguzins are diffint then books. Becuse you got rap which i think is stupped. theres rock and roll, cuntery, pop, hard rock, jazz, and others.Movies are diffent to cuz you got movies that kids dont need to see. Good movies for kids is like @CAPS1, hopp, and so on. Maguzins are about like movies there are things in maguzins that are just as bad in muics, movies, and books.

2,"I'm writing about my views on censorship in libraries. I'll begin by asking; what is censorship? Think about that question while you're reading, or stop and think a moment before you continue. I hope what I have to say will give you a clear idea or a new perspective, and that you might understand what I think the importance of censorship in libraries really means, and not just to me, but to all who pick up a book.     To answer my previous question, censoring is the removing of suggestive or otherwise offensive materials from any or all sources of information, or entertainment. Now I'll ask another question; why do we have censorship?     Most believe that all children have a right to know things they'll learn about eventually whether or not they want to, and therefore don't care when their children are exposed to that knowledge. Those people don't consider the consequences of that knowledge in the wrong hands, or wrong minds.     Children don't think on the same track that most adults do, and therefore are incapable of handling certain knowledges that adults have long since known and otherwise dealt with. Those who know of the consequences of certain knowledges in the wrong minds have tried to keep the information from those who can't or shouldn't worry about them untill they're older and more capable of understanding what it all means.     A lot of ideas we have @DATE1, from science and technology, from philosophical thinking to common sense, most everything has been written down in the past, or is being written @DATE1. That's where the problems arise. Almost everything is written about or recorded in some way, therefore increasing the chances that someone will hear or see this knowledge and, not knowing it's importance, might even abuse it eventually.     Think about the crimes that go on @DATE1. Are all of them simple? Do they all focus on the same things? How do they come about? All these questions are able to be answered in the simplest ways; the people who commited them learned about something too early in life and grew up thinking it was ok, whether they learned it from books, or music, or movies, etc., and eventually repeated these things they learned.     Of course that's not always the case, but for those people who don't know why so many people ended up as the people who get thrown into jail, or get into trouble, a major factor is what they learn at an early age, and not having sensible people to help them to know what's right and what's wrong.     To conclude, I think the best ways to avoid the wrong information getting into the wrong hands, is to have censorship in libraries. Without it, people can just walk up to any shelf and pick up that one book, even a nine-year-old child.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Some books, music, movies, and magazines or other types of information or entertanment are innapropriate. I dont believe that they should be removed from the library or other puplic places for that reason though. You have to take a lot into conciteration before decideing weather it should be censored or not.     Age is one aspect. If the material is not sutable to a sertain age then it should be organized into a different age category according to the library. I believe that there should be age limits like the ones they have on movies or video games.      Rescently there was a book, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, that was questioned on the use of language in it. I think that the author wrote their book the way they want it and would like it sold that way not have it censored.      If you find something offensive that doesen't mean you should keep getting involved with it. If there is a book or movie that is offfensive to you, you can stop reading or stop watching it at your own will.     Often on the radio there are songs that use innapropriate language and it is bleeped out. Why should we bleep it? Some people could find it more offensive to hear it bleeped than to hear the words just said. And thier oppinion should be the one that counts.     The questin weather there should be censorship in libraries is all about a persons perspecitve. Someone is always going to see it differently than you. There is nothing bad about that. I remember watching a show one time and there were these characters in a book club and they were debateing the book its self. Not always is everyone going to like your oppinion of something but you shouldn't despise people for that. I believe that the libraries should not have to use censorship when we have lived as humans long enough to be able to make a decision for ourselves. We should stop being told what to do by rules and laws all the time and have our oppinions heard.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I believe that our libraries should stay the same as they have always been. People have the right to read or watch what they want to. I thought thats why we are @CAPS1. Our public libraries have always been safe and clean enviornments and if its not broke dont fix it.      I never even heard of a problem in the libraries about things offending people before but sometimes people just need to grow up. There's a certain point to where yeah things should not be writen or films that should'nt have been made but if you dont like it, then dont read it and or watch it.      People all have a right to the libraries. Nobody forces anyone to read or watch something, its by the readers choice. Theres no sence in ruining many peoples enjoyment just because a selected few people dont like something. Thats like the @ORGANIZATION2 not having any football just because the players feel like they dont get payed enough @MONEY1 to play it. Taking books and magazines off the library shelves is like the @ORGANIZATION2 locking out everything. Just because a few people arent happy, doesnt mean that everything should be taking out so others cant enjoy it. Why even have a library if your going to change everything because people get offended. Is @ORGANIZATION1 going to stop carrying penuts because some people are allergic to them? No. If people dont like something they have the choice to buy or take it if they want to or not.      Its a simple fact that some things should just be left alone. People are all different. Its going to take a long time for people to figure that out. In fact, people @MONTH1 never figure that out. So in my opionion I believe that the libraries can carry anything they want as long as it is appropreit.      My thinking is that it will be best if we keep libraries the way they are. In the end, more people will be unhappy of a change than the happier it makes people after the change. in other words the numbers of people who are happy with the change will be out weighed greatly with the people who are unhappy.

Now in high school I think its ok to have those bad words in the book, movie, music, etc. If they choose to read it, or listen to it, or watch it then I think its fine.

2,"Imagine. Imagine a little girl about the age of four walking through differnce sections of books in a library when she finds a book that cacthes her eye in the adult section. The book is baby blue and has a little bird on it. However, the book also has a half naked man on cover besided the cute little bird. The girl grabs the book and goes happly to find her mom. When the mom looks at the book her face is in shock. What would you do if that was your daughter? Most likely we'd put the book back and explain why she can't have it. While, others would go screaming to the check out and asking, 'how is it possible that my daughter got this? Shouldn't the libraries be wacthing the kids to make sure they don't go in that section?'. I believe that certain materials, such as books,movies, ect., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact people will still find way to get the removed material and that it's just a part of life.     My first reason that certain materials, such as books, shouldn't be pulled from are shelves is that we live in a nation that prides it's self as the '@CAPS1 of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. That doesn't mean we get everything for @CAPS2 when we go to a store it just simple means that you, the people of @LOCATION1, have the freedom and right to speak your mind. So you can say whatever you want in newspapers or  in books because the government gives you that right. However, you can't say 'I have a bomb' at the airports because of the many attacks the nation has encountered over the years, but that's common sences.     My second reason that certain materials should say on the put, even if someone is offened by it is that no matter how many books or movies you take of the store shelves, the people will find a way to get them. One way to get them is the black market where people sell drugs and weapons. Do we, as a country really need another drug on the market even if it's a book? I think not. Also, if you look at the whole picture people will be losing jobs because the televison today is not the kind they had back in your grandma's day. Nearly @PERCENT1 of everything on televison has something to do with the little three letter s-word every parent hates to talk about.        You might be thinking that if we take the unrated movies and the books with the naked men on the cover we'd be saving are children which leads me to my last point. Seeing unrated movies and such is a part of life. So what are you saving them from? Children sooner or later will grow up and learn about the types of subject matter so why take it off when you will have to teach them about it sooner rather then later? Millions of parents around the @CAPS3 each and every year have to teach their kids about the birds and the bees. It's a part of growing up in a way. Now a days though, the birds and the bees are all people seem to talk about. So like it or not your kids will find out just like you did and your parents before you. Plus, your not going to make everyone happy. Someone will always be offened by something.     Imagine. Imagine that same little girl, now an adult, having to deal with that same issue of the same baby blue book with the same little bird with the half naked man on the cover. The truth is that this way my mother when she was little and it turns out that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree because I had the same issue as well. I know that one day I will also have the same issue as my mother did before me. So I believe that certain materials, such as books and movies, shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because of the right to @CAPS2 speech, the fact that people will still find a way to get the removed material and that it's just apart of life.

2,"Dear @CAPS1,          I am writing you @DATE1 because I think all media such as books, music, movies and magazines that are offensive should be removed from shelves from libraries because they do not set a role for people. The media should be for everyone to enjoy and not have to worry about offensive material. In @DATE1's world there are offensive media out there and they often start up problems. We need to do something about this problem.     If there are offensive media out there the kids of the future are going to look up to them and try to be like them or hate the same thing that the media does. Let's just say there was a song about school and how people dont like it don't you think our kids are going to hate school too? I don't think that is right. We need to teach our kids that school is very important and not to take in what the media says because they are not always right.    We want enjoyable media in the world. We want good things for our future kids to see and hear. We don't want kids picking up bad words. We need to watch what we put out in the world. If there is something offensive remove it from the shelves as soon as possible or just not put it out to the public at all.      Offensive media can often start up problems in the world. Weither it's in the @CAPS2.S or somewhere around the world. If a book talks about how bad a certain race is those people that were disliked in the book are going to get even with the people who made the book or other media. Many issues @DATE1 are over media out there in the world. People that work at libraries should keep an eye out for offensive materals and shoud remove them to prevent even more problems.     I'm sure libraries all around the world have some kind of offensive media in it. We need to stand up and fight to get rid of all offensive media and make the world a better place.

2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     @CAPS1 of us would agree with Katherine Paterson when she said that there are books we hope our future generations do not chance across. @CAPS1 of us would also agree that she made a very good point when she said that if any of us present-generation people were granted the ability to take the said books from the shelves, there would no longer be any reading material for anyone to read. Truth be told, there are many ways for our offspring to not have the availability of those books. There is what I believe to be an appropriate division on the materials in our libraries and bookstores, the fact that we can always monitor what our children read and watch, and not to mention that we can use the internet to back up any doubts we have on the literature and lyrics.The question that remains is: Are we using the ways of preventing this problem to the best of our abilities?     I believe that our public libraries and bookstores do a splendid job of diviying up what is deemed appropriate for each age group. Teens know a fairly good amount more about things than all parents invision they shouldn't, and I think the bookstores and libraries keep the youths knowledge in what they're listening, watching, and reading to what these kids already know. Comparing what is considered a 'young adult' book and an 'adult' book, you will find an atrocious difference. Young adult books only hint around things such as drugs, refraining from abstinence,  and grisly murder scenes whereas adult books go into a great deal more detail.  Middle school level children's books are even more less detailed than teen books, so it is save to say that as long as the parents are directing their child into the appropriate section in anyone's given local library, they will be in good hands.     There's also the option of monitering what our young ones are listening to. By simply being interested in what it is that the child is singing or humming along to, us parents would find that they wouldn't be reluctant to let on about what was being said. If in any case we feel that the lyrics are too harsh for the kid, we are still their parents and have the right to deem it as something they shouldn't be listening to and suggest something different to them and/or ban them from being able to listen. In @CAPS1 cases though, we should try to listen to what our kids are. In this way, we can be reassured that the range of materials they're plugging into their ears are not what we would consider to be grotesque for something our children's age.     Another useful tool would have to be the internet. If we don't feel the need to ask about the literature or music, but @MONTH1 still have a few doubts, there are plenty of book and music blogs across the world wide web that can help us out. Even by going to a bookstore website and reading the description about the book, or a lyric website that will tell us what is being said, or even a movie website where we can see a rating and the content of the movie, and the comments left by people that go with it respectively, @CAPS1 of us would find all of the information we need.  Even author's, director's, and artist's websites would be useful. Looking at their  discussions would be a big help as well, considering that @CAPS1 of these people have a vision of what age groups would be attracted to their material.     In conclusion, I think our children are fairly wise about what they choose to read, listen to, and watch, but then again, it all depends on the preference. Not every child is the same, just as not any adult, or any one person. The prefernce tends to lean towards the things we think are appropriate. Paying attention to what the young ones are like says alot about what they read, and what they listen to and watch, for that matter. We have all these ways of keeping our children from reading, watching and listening to inappropriate things, we just have to make them and asset",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"For many years libraries have had books, magazines, and movies posted in their shelves of the library that are very offensive to many people. Many people ask how is it ok for that material to be open to teenagers and possibly children. In my opinion I think that it is not right for libraries not to do anything about this problem, especially when this is happening across the nation.      In large department stores such as @ORGANIZATION1, you are required to be eighteen years old to purchase adult items, sometimes you must be twenty-one years of age. It is considered illegal for anyone under the required age to purchase an item with an age limit on it. Music is a totally different type of profanity, @CAPS1 albums are sold with much innapropiate material in them that is open to the public, but the @CAPS1's sold in stores are usually edited into a more appropiate version. Days like today nearly no one ever buys @CAPS1's anymore, its all about @CAPS4's and @NUM1's where all you have to do is find your song on a site and download it for free in about four to five seconds. It would not surprise me if libraries had music and @CAPS1's with just as much adult profanity, and language that is not edited out.      So if most of the things in this world that are adult rated and can not be purchased  unless your considered an adult by age, why should it be ok to viewed by any age in a library. I myself believe that it should be illegal for materials such as the ones mentioned to be banned or atleast taken more respected with the viewer of the materials. It would really hurt a parent for them to take a kid to a library and tell them to go find a book they like, and they return to their mother or father with an adult book with many things a child or possibly a teenager should not see. I believe times like those could tear a parent or even a grandparent apart, having to explain to their children or grandchildren what they just saw. Because most of us know that most children always want to know what something is when they see it, and for a parent to have to explain to their child at that age has to be heart-stopping.     In all of this that I have explained is only my opinion, but I believe many other millions of people agree with me. If it is not aloud almost everywhere else in this world, why should it be ok a library to do it? Is it because its some little rule about freedom of decision? Do libraries think just because they are old fashioned and have been here longer than the @CAPS1's, @CAPS4's, and @NUM1's that they dont have to follow rules and guidelines. It is a shame that they are ruining the lives and visions of the children and teens today to think its ok for anyone to see, listen, or watch these materials.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"There are many books in the libraries. Some people take them offensively. Materials such as books, moveis, and magazines should be removed it they are offending people.     Books that are offending someone should be removed. One reason is that they relate to people lifestyles.Some books relate to family issues and have negativity about them. Others relare to home issuse where they involve abuse. There are also book that are on bullying. These should be removed because children can read them and start bullying other children. Also they can b threatening to children that are being bullyed.     Also, movies can be offending. Movies that are based on bad action should be removed. Most of these movies consider harsh words. Children that like action movies should not be listening to anything like that. Action movies have a lot of abuse in them. Young children can act these movies out and hurt other children. Some movies also have violence in them. If children see people using violence in the movies they would want to do it to because they think its cool. Also people in these kind of movies use bad treatment toward people. This can effect people lives.     Also, magazines that are offending people should also be removed. Magazines show and tell things that celebrities are doing. Not only will young children do these things but young adults. Magazines also show people criticizing politics. Some @MONTH1 include talking bad about the @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS1. Young adults @MONTH1 take this the wrong way and start doing the same thing. This @MONTH1 also make it seem like they are bad people. Also, they use verbal abuse and use bad lauguages.     Some books, movies, and magazines should be removed if  they are offensive to people. Young children and young adults are the most effected by this. They are effected because they see what adults are doing and want to do the same thing. Especially people that they think are role models. All books that are offensive should be removed.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Reflecting newspaper views on censorship in libraries. I say no that the books, music, movies, or magazines should not be removed from libraries, because if the books or etc. are that offensive, those things shouldn't be in childrens reach anyway. There should be a section limit where children can't go by to get to the offensive type books and others. Why take things that older people would insist on looking at off the shelf just because someone didn't separate the adult books and etc., from the childrens.     Taking away the things that adults look at would be just as bad as taking the things that children or teens would like such as the music and movies, even though the music sometimes influnce some children to do bad or get off track from being who they really are. I don't understand why take those type things down when you are getting benefits off the things that people buy that will help keep libraries open such as fun rasier type. If you don't have things in a library that will capture a young persons attention like the movies, music, or magazines then children or teens will not be interested on going to libraries.     Adults nor teens will sit in a library with under age books, movies, or music. Reason being is, becuase they are muture and not exactly looking for a book with lots of pictures and cartoons unless they are reading to an under age sibling. When that child has to go to library with his or her parent for example to do a project that parent would rather not just sit and wait the whole time for his or her child to finish. That is where the magazines come in ; magazines are very interesting books such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 those magazines occupy peoples time while they are waiting just like any other places.     Everywhere you go children are going to see things that they shouldn't see at their age, because television and the internet has so many componets that will cause a distraction to a childs mind that will make them question everything they see. That child will soon have to learn. That is how most children are becoming so blunt with the things they do or say, because either they seen it or heard it.     I know you @MONTH1 think that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves to keep out of reach of children, but I think that if you are able to separate all upper age group books, movies, music, magazines from all children and other young adults, the library would become more beneficial to everyone that has access to a local library.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.  Materials should not be offensive in any way to chilren, or any human being.  Now, I will tell the many readers that will read this article what I think should be and what should not be on the shelf.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories, should teach lessons, and should not be offensive.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell stories.  When I sit down to read a book or magazine, or to watch a movie, I want to read or watch an interesting story.  A little child is not going to want to read a book about history or science, they will want to read about @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @LOCATION2, or @ORGANIZATION1.  Children will not sit still unless they have something to read or watch that is interesting and appealing to them.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should teach lessons.  I believe that libraries should have books, magazines, etc., that teach them how to tie their shoes, to count, or to say the alphabet. Children love to sing, so simply put a @CAPS3 in that sings the alphabet, and the child will be singing along shortly. When a child pulls a book off of the shelf at a library, that shows a pretty picture, the child will be attracted to it, and learn as they read or watch.       Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be offensive.  Kids should not read a book, magazine, etc., if the author is talking about harming someone or something.  If the book, magazine, etc., has inappropriate language or insult someone, that book needs to be taken off of the shelf and immediately thrown in the trash.  The last thing a parent wants is their child to learn something bad from a book and repeat it at school, because that will only lead up to the child getting in serious trouble.      Again, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned from the shelves if they are found offensive.  Parents do not want to get a phone call from the schoool principal saying their child is using inappropriate language, or being offensive to others.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should tell wonderful stories, should teach children things that will help them in school, and should not say harmful things about someone or something.

I mean why take out all the information if you can learn from it.     I do think the books, movies, magazines, and music should be age appropiate. I think this because little kids should not be reading high school text. They would not understand it and not learn anything from it. If it is age appropiate I think it would be very helpful. I also think everyone should be able to go to the library to have some quiet time.     Magazines to me are very helpful. They are very helpful because you can read a small paragraph, and learn a lot. Me myself I love to read magazines they are very informational. They also have great pictures in them unlike books. If you take these out of libraries they would be no help.     I love going to the library to have some quiet time. I think that if you take out books, and magazines there would be no point in going.

2,"In libraries today there is a big controversy going on about wether certain books, music and magazines should be taken out due to explicit material. There are just to many views on what is explicit to discern between what should be allowed, and what should be expunged. In many cases libraries have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in which books, that the majority of people would consider explicit, are held. These @CAPS2 are normally closed off and a person has to exert some sort of physical motion through a barrier in order to enter, therefore they are in full knowledge that there @MONTH1 be offensive literature there. One also must take into account the meaning of the term '@CAPS3 @CAPS4'. That term has a key phrase in the title, @CAPS3, which is almost a warning in itself that the literature in it @MONTH1 be offensive to someone. These points show that there should be no restriction on the books, magazines or music in @CAPS3 libraries.     The first topic of discussion is the definition of obscene. There are @NUM1 billion people, in the @LOCATION1 alone, that all have their own views of what they consider obscene to be. If one asked an avid conservative their thoughts on obscenity, they would differ by a tremendous amount of those that a free-spirited individual would have. The inconsistency of views is an obvious reason to keep all types of books in libraries. Not only that but also the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 allows libraries to put grossly obscene literature in a hidden, but accessible area.     @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are made for one purpose, to sheild the general @CAPS3 of things that would be seen by the majority as obscene. These @CAPS2 are not out in the open where anyone can stumble upon them, they are usually in a corner of the @CAPS4, closed off, and marked '@CAPS1'. These @CAPS2 allow a little bit of compromise between the two sides of the debate for censorship, by still allowing all types of literature, but also sheilding anyone from seeing or hearing any of it unpurposefully. Because of these @CAPS2 there is no way anyone could complain about obscenity in the general @CAPS4 setting. For the libraries without @CAPS1 @CAPS2, there is the warning on the door of the @CAPS4, the word @CAPS3.     @CAPS3 libraries are intended for the @CAPS3. Walking into one, under ones own power, dispells any complaints one would have about obscenity. This is because the act of entering a @CAPS3 @CAPS4, puts one in the atmosphere of the @CAPS4, whatever it @MONTH1 be. Libraries should not be held responsible for whether or not the literature on their shelves is offensive. The word @CAPS3 in the term @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is, like said previously, a warning of its own, letting anyone know who is entering that there is a chance there @MONTH1 be some things that person could precieve as obscene. This and multiple other reasons put to rest any thought one would have about removing certain literature from libraries.     The three reasons given, along with the many more out there left unsaid, make it inevitable that libraries are not ment to be censored. The fact that the word obscene can not be tailored to fit everyone's personal views, the existance of @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and the word @CAPS3 placed infront of @CAPS4, warning everyone any type of literature could be in said @CAPS4, are enough to disspell any thought of censoring libraries. Underground bunkers were designed to sheild and censor the @CAPS3, not libraries.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Bad @CAPS1 Should be Removed     I think that they schould be taken off of the shelves in libraries.  I  am going to tell you why I think they should be taken off of the sheleves. I am also going to tell about one of my personal experiences with something like this.     The reason I think @CAPS1 like this should be taken off of the shelves, is because of little kids coming in and taking them off of the shelves and looking at @CAPS1, that aren't apporate for little childern to see. And older kids looking at them and getting some ideas from them and going home and doing them. Which could cause harm of even death.     A personal experience with something like this when I was in fourth grade. Is I went to my teachers bookshelf and picked out a book to take home. That night when I got home I asked my mom if she colud read it to me before I went to bed. So she did and when she opened the book it had alot of bad words in it. That are bad for little childeren to hear. So she to it to the principal the next day and showed it to him and he fired the teacher for having the book on the shelves.

2,"Should certain things in life be censored? Absolutely, there are many books, magazines, and music selections that should have never reached the shelf. Life has many choices. The people of this world have a choice on what they read or listen to. At a young age we are taught right from wrong. Everyone has different rights and many different wrongs, that they are taught by their parents. It is those morals we our taught that help us decide what we should listen to or what we shoud read.     I am a high school student that is very aware of right or wrong. Though my choices @MONTH1 not show as much. I am very aware of what I read and put into my head. Who wants to have certain magazine sex stories in their head? Not me, thats for sure! That makes any guy a perverse guy. I don't read books the tell me how to get in a girl's pants, that is wrong and I belive that should be censored. As a high school guy looking at a girl can be tough on some and then deciding to read about how to get a girl only encourages those types of attitudes. It is the exact same for girls too. Reading wrong stuff puts it into your head. What goes in your head comes out.     Music is very influential in todays world. Rap for instence talks about money, sex, and drugs. Like I said garbage in is garbage out. Rap does have a good side too, all music does it is just an example. Then you have rockstars that do the exact same thing. All music depending on the genre you listen to, does say a lot about the person he/ or she is. Christen music does not need to be censored, because it is positive and up-lifting. Not all songs on the radio need to be censored either. Yes the ones talking about sex, drugs, and other terrible things need to be censored. Why would you want to put that stuff in your head? It makes no sense  if that is who you want to be, a unintellegent person that no one likes, due to your moods.     Movies could do without all the vulgar language and the sex scenes. Movies are meant to be enjoyed. Movies recently have not been family oriented. Transformers for example is a go out with your friends movie. The @CAPS1 series should never have been created. The person that made the @CAPS1 series has a very dark and twisted mind. Scary movies have a purpose for @CAPS3 and other festivities. Scary or not it should have less sex scenes. You should not have to worry what your child is going to see if he/ or she goes out to the movies with friends. Movies play a big part in our economy and that means many adults, teenagers, and children our watching something that is or is not good for their mind and well-being, but movies still have positive impact, jsut depends on what your watching.     It is very obvious that our society has different views on, if things should be censored or not. People have their own lifes to lead and live, it is their right to decide what is right and what is wrong. Books, music, and movies influence our society in many ways. Yes some things need to be censored, because music and movies are making some things socially acceptable. When growing up not all things are socially acceptable, or so we are taught. Schools should not censor many books or our music selections, because it is high school it is when we discover ourselves. It is the morals that we are taught that define us, and what we learn from those morals of what is right or wrong to; read, listen to, or watch, that is what builds us as people to grow. You put garbage in your morals with what you do, you are only going to get garbage out",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"During my freshman year there was a lot of controversy over whether or not the classes should be allowed to read 'The @ORGANIZATION1' in school. The debate was due to the fact that there is a rape scene in the book, which many people find too innappropriate for freshman to be reading about. However, it seems to me that we are exposed to offensive things every day and it is not plausible to simply censor every innappropriate thing we come across. In terms of censorship in libraries, it is outlandish to think that we could do the same thing.     When people visit libraries, they are there to check out books that they want to read. While there @MONTH1 be many forms of offensive media avaliable to the public through the library, that doesn't mean that people are obligated to view them. We are all perfectly capable of choosing for ourselves what we put into our minds. Because the media advertises offensive things all the time, we cannot block out everything. However we can chose what it is that we want to read when we visit the library. Since it is a choice, it shouldn't be necessary to censor everything there because you don't have to chose to view it.      Censorship is also very subjective. What is deemed offensive to someone, @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. If we oblige to sensor everything anyone claims to be offensive, there would no longer be any forms of media left. This is much like the quote from Katherine Paterson, where she says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We rid the libraries of what each person finds offensive and what do you have left?     Being around things we find offensive is, sadly, a part of life. That does not mean that we have engage in such things. It will never get to a point where everyone is completely happy with the way things are being censored unless everything is done away with, and that would only bring about new issues. We have to have the self control to provide censorship for ourselves, we cannot leave that job to other people.",3.0,3.0,4.0

Heres an example, I saw this really awesome video game that I wanted once. But my dad said no. Cause its language and themes were bad. At first I thought I hated my dad. But now I'm glad I didn't buy it. Cause what good would a video game do in the long run. Will it pay bills? No it won't. Will it bring food to the table? No it won't. Will it help you get married? No I think not. The point is the choices made now is what is going to effect you in the long run.          I really think its choice. If you make the choice of buying a movie or book,music etc.With that kind of offensive behavior. Then, thats how your representing youself to others around you.

Anyone that picks up a book does it for a certain reason, they could be interested in it or they @MONTH1 just want too @CAPS1 at it and think why would anyone want to read something like @CAPS3.

Also almost every library has a childrens section for a certain age group and under to pick out a book for themselves to read. If they go to the adult section and get a book it is their parent or guardians responsibility to make sure they @CAPS1 at the books the child has picked out. They can choose to do that or let the child get the book.     I have not personally seen a book that should not be on a shelf in the library, but my mom has told me about something she had seen. My mother had seen a magazine that had said, '@CAPS1! To @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!' I dont think they should take things like that away because it could be something someone wants to read. If a child sees it then the parent was not paying that good of attention to them. @CAPS3 can be prevented to where it is not a problem.

Someone a little bit older then me picked up the book and checked it out, my mom said you can read that when you get older just not right for your age.

Plus @CAPS3 would limit all the good choices to pick from in the library,     I think its not fair for the other people because not everybody thinks the same. The people that do like the action or humor or romance books would probably be upset @CAPS3 they took them away.Its also not fair because @CAPS3 takes away what they actually come to the library for in the first place. People that are offended by things always have other places to go to find books and movies and things like that.     Not everybody has money to spend on movies. The library is a great place to barrow free movies and books and magazines if you cant afford to buy any. My family didnt have mony to buy any movies so we would go straight to the library to get free ones. Movies now days are very expinsive to jus be buying all the time. In the long run those movie cost are going to add up.     Removing everything offensive would really limit the good choices in the library. If you are just left with all the boaring material nobody will come but the ones who got offended. People want the good stuff thats why majority of the folks go. I useally go for the music, books, and movies, but i would just leave if i saw they took all the good choices away. I left the library once because they took away my favorite book, 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I loved that book and they told me they no longer have @CAPS3.

Why would you keep offensive material in the libraries anyway? If it was you in our shoes and you found a book offensive, wouldn't you want that book remove? Having material that is offensive to people in libraries is just plain wrong.     The reason I believe that libraries should remove offensive material because, I always see books and movies that are racist toward @CAPS1. Like these qoutes '@CAPS1 are fat and lazy people.''@CAPS1 are border jumpers.''All @CAPS1 are good is farming and cleaning.' @CAPS5 on now, not all @CAPS1 are fat. Some of us have jobs and are tired from working long hours. We are not border jumpers. We have our passports/ green cards.All of these things are offensive and should be removed.

'@CAPS10, how many @CAPS9 does it take to clean up the house? None because they're dirty so way does it matter.' I know then you would want the library to remove that book.

2,"Should we be censoring what people read in libraries? Absolutely! I believe we should, at least for the children. There are some pretty bad things out there that I do not believe are quite appropriate for children, or even teenagers. If I were a parent, there are many things I would not let my child read or look at. If we don't even give them a chance to see them, then we wouldn't have to worry.      Chidren these day are not what they used to be. What would their great grandparents think if they saw the way today's adolescents act, dress, and even talk? Where do you think they get this from? The answer is simple. They get it from today's movies, books, music, and magazines. We cannot keep going on like this or eventually we will have toddlers acting inappropriately!     I know from experience that when children are small and they see or hear something, it sticks with them for a long time. If child is looking through a magazine and they see a questionable picture, they are not likely to forget that picture very soon. Or if they are listening to a song with bad words, don't be surprised if they do not forget them or even start repeating them. That is just how small children are.     My last point is the fact that parents would probably be much happier if offensive material was removed from libraries. Parents would be able to bring their children to the library and not have to worry about what they are looking at or listening to. The children would feel a sense of freedom and the parents would, in return, feel a sense of reassurance.     Offensive material should definitely be removed from our libraries in order to keep our children pure and their parents happy. I understand that others would argue that if we take out offensive material then eventually, there would be nothing left for our children to read. Well, obviously not everything can be censored, but I think a lot of it should be. Censoring material in libraries is definitely the way to go, not just for our children, but also our teenagers",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Libraries          @CAPS1 we would do without books? We wouldn't have libraries, right? And @CAPS1 if someone decided to remove certain books? Libraries are very helpful to us. They are our number one resource material. Libraries could teach us many things. We could learn many topics; history, biographies about important people from the past and our present, fiction and nonfiction stories and many more. Libraries are for all ages, from youngest to oldest.     Libraries have many books, movies, magazines, sometimes even music and ect. Their is always something to learn in a library. I belive many topics are unappropriate to certain people of different ages. Yes, they are maybe to young to learn these topics, but @CAPS1 about when they get older and want to learn? We need libraries. We need books. Kids, teenagers and ect. will enentually learn the topic, either in the libraty or at home, even at school with friends; so why take our books away?      I also belive that even though I don't like certain topics, they should not be removed from the libraries. I peronally agree with the author Katherine Paterson, she thought many books were offensive to the audiance, but if someone had the power to remove a book from the shelfs, that made everyone to have this power, and @CAPS1 would we have left? We would loose very important information of our lifes and our ancestors.      People have different taste, fellings, thoughts. If we listen to every person's dislikes over our books in the libraries, our shelfs would be empty and eventually we wouldn't have libraries. I'm please asking you, don't remove our books of the shelfs. Don't take our past and our future. We are who we are because of the information books have thought us during the years. Books, magazines, movies and music are part of our lifes, taking them away, you are taking our lifes aswell",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Its an @CAPS1     Have you ever been in a library and you are looking for a certin book, but just cannot seen to find it because everything is out of order? Many libraries have trouble organizing their material, in ways that will help people find what their looking for easier. I believe that books movies, magazines and music should all be separated. I do not believe books that some people find offensive should not be taken of shelfs, because they @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people.     Books should be seperated by reading levels in libraries. Having a kid, teen and adult section, will help organize a library. This will make it much easier for children to find books that they can actually read. Also if children books are seperated of adult books parents wont find any book offencive to their children. Having books organized by reading levels will make life much easier for a person looking for a certin reading level.      Music should be put in to certin catorgies such as rock, jazz, rap or country. Childrens music should be in the kids section along with the books, magazines and movies. Doing this for the children will keep them away from unappriate music, books, maganzies and movies. The music section should not have any bad language in the music that they allow to be checked out. If anyone considered any of the music in the library offensive the library should remove it.     Movies should also be seprated by age levels. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, and @CAPS3 should be the catorgies that the movies should be put into. The only exception should be the childrens movies which should be put into the children section. No one should be allowed to check out a book unless the are old enough for the catorgie they are checking out.     This is my view on how libraries should be set up. I think by doing this it would keeps the younger children away from books that might be offensive to them. I do not think that books that some people find offensive should be taken off the shelfs, because they might not be offensive to other people",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Should certain books be removed from a library just becouse they ae found offensive? Types of movies magazines and music should all those be removed becouse some people come to find it offensive. No,Everyone has a different oppionion so in the end everything is offensive one way or another to people  thier would be no books left on the shelf.     First, of all I believe that books,movies,mucic, and magazins ets... should not be removed from the shelves becouse everyone has thier right to thier own oppinion. The author of those things had the right to publish thier work its thier oppionion lots of people @MONTH1 agree with what that piece of work as well as many people @MONTH1 not agree at all and come to find it offensive. Its your choice to listen or read certain topics,everything has a title or a gender so you should know wether that piece of work is for you or not. If you know you are going to come to a decagrenment then the easy choice is simple just to not read it or listen to it.It is a very easy choice to make, therefore not causing any type of problem.     Second, of all is thier needs to be all types of variety in library's therefore bieng books,movies,magazines music ect...for everyone to enjoy or anything you'd like. I mean thats what libraries are sapposed to be like. I like how I can go to the school library of the local town library and be able to find right about anytype of topic from it being on animals to information about drug abusers.     Last, but not least comes in the parential control. Yes, thier @MONTH1 be many parents out thier of not mostley all of parents @MONTH1 find many things in a library that they would not like thier child to see or hear. But thats just life. Parents should know what thier kids are up to so its up to them to them to teach thier child ffrom right from wrong.     In conclusion libraries should not exclude any type of music,magazine,or any type of book just becouse someone @MONTH1 come to find it offensive everyone has the right to thier own oppionion and just becouse you come to find it offensive does not mean eryone else does as well people work should be shown to the world and if you choose not to take it in then dont",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Over the years many materials such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., have been removed from the shelves of libraries all over the world. Well I find this to be sad and dishonorable to many people.     In the past children were able to remove book, etc., from the shelves without being questioned by anyone. Isn't @CAPS3 the job of the libraries to supply book and more to children for learning purposes weather they are in or out of school, children have the right to learn the same as everyone else in which Katherine explained, 'If you take books of the shelves then we will have no books left on the shelves for any of us.'     I have seen what this does to people, they sit around all day doing nothing just thinking about the happiness that these things brought to them and trust me @CAPS3's not a pretty sight. Just because something looks bad or inapropriate doesn't mean you can just take @CAPS3 off the shelf, due to the fact that there are others who would want to read, watch or listen to that sort of thing. I have also experienced this when I wanted to check out a @CAPS1 that was produced by a raper, I went to the check-out desk showed them the @CAPS1 and then they said, 'I'm sorry, that souldn't be on the shelf anymore.' @CAPS3 was outragious just because of @CAPS3 being produced by a raper. Now I ask you this, 'Think about @CAPS3 if you were in our shoes.'So in conclusion, the fact that the things you want to check out are being taken out dosen't feel right not to us, not to the children, and of course not to the future generation to come. We won't stand by while this happens, @CAPS3's time for them to make a choice between the right or the wrong.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Offensive reading, music, and movies are popular with parents who are trying to sheild their young children.  Not all people find this type of reading, lyrics, and appearences on @CAPS1.V. offensive, however. To some people, offensive has different meanings, and the object wouldn'@CAPS1 be out for sale if it wasn'@CAPS1 popular in some way. I don'@CAPS1 disagree with the use of offensiveness, but that is just my opinion and I have reasons to back it up.    Parents in our generation listen to the music that kids and teenagers listen to now. Some find them disgusting and vulgar, while others are singing along with the tunes on the radio and with their children. Now a days, the artists' music appeals greatly to the younger children because of the upbeat background music and not all because of the lyrics. My mother has told me time and time again about how she hates some of the artists I listen to such as @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because of the vulgarity in their lyrics. My response is, '@CAPS4, it's all life experiences, and that's what attracts us kids to their music and they know it. Plus, sometimes I just like to listen to the songs because of the music, not just the lyrics.    Children can back up their beliefs on the music, but somehow the parents always 'know what's best.' So, they try to take away the music that the kids have come to know and love. Sorry parents, that won'@CAPS1 work. All over the popular radio stations, the hosts are playing these songs trying to get more loyal listeners, and they are succeeding. Parents can'@CAPS1 stop their children from being exposed to what they think is offensive music; sadly, it's all around them, from billboards and posters sold at malls to the so called popular music and movies of today's generation.    The famous artists wouldn'@CAPS1 be making the vulgar and offensive music if they thought no one would buy their albums. In this generation, sex, drugs, and alcohol sell, so the rap artists and the popular choice in music put those factors into their songs. Teenagers will buy their cd's and the artists will keep making music to please their buyers.    Not all music out there now is offensive though. There is country music, blues, oldies, and I'm sure more that don'@CAPS1 put vulgarity into their songs. But, if you listen carefully, more songs are starting to add curse words and talking about drinking, because they know what the people want to hear. If the parents don'@CAPS1 agree with the choice in music, they can change their presettings in their cars to more resonable music that they approve of. Eventually, I believe that vulgarity will increase and it will be all around us, not only in music, but everywhere we look.    Also, in movies, directors and producers know that the viewers want to see action. Sex and drugs sell big time in the movie area because it gives the viewers something exciting to see and to tell their friends about. People now a days don'@CAPS1 want to spend the seven or @MONEY1 to see a movie that is about praries and horses, the majority want to see something with more hype and excitement.    Most movies have been upgraded to the @CAPS5 rating instead of the @NUM1 or just @CAPS6 movies because of the reasons of offensive language and actions. To attend these movies, we all know you have to be of the age of eighteen, but what about for the teenagers that don'@CAPS1 want to sit around and watch animated movies full of made up characters? I understand that the producers and directors are shielding our eyes from the obscenity, but it just makes the movie that much more appealing to the younger children's eyes.    I believe, that as we get older, the offensive language and actions, the vulgarity in music, movies, and books, and the rude and crude message that has been displayed in front of us, will increase greatly. I'm not saying that it's okay for offensive language and actions to be in movies, books, music, etc., I'm saying it's what sells and if people like to listen to it, no one can stop them.",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Censorship or No Censorship    You walk through huge metal and glass doors. As you do so your eyes fall upon huge shelves full of books, magazines, movies, music and everything else that you could imagine. Then you  proceed to walk in and out through the various forms of liturature gently touching the spines of each book, magazine, movie case, music case. But suddenly something unusal catches your eye, the sight stuns you at first. What sight would be so stunning that it would make you stop in your tracks immediatly? The answer is, the sight of your favorite section being censored. Just imagine; all of the books being taken away, all of the music being thrown out, magazines being thrown into dumpsters and so on with all of the other forms of writting, speeches, songs, and acting. That @MONTH1 be okay with others, but it's not okay with me.     How many books have you read? How many of those books did you like? How many of those books, that you liked, could be offensive to someone other than you? the chances are that everyone has probably read at least two books that could be offensive to someone else. But the chances are much greater that someone could read that book and possibly have a good reaction and maybe even be changed for the better. Take @PERSON1's book of theories of evolution as example. The book could being offensive to someone who believes in a higher power and they might think that their religion's bible is the one and only story. But to a medical, science or even history student the book could help them understand their field of study and research better. Therefore, making one side strongly against the book, but one side strongly in favor of the book. No matter which side you're on, one will almost always lose to censorship.     During the time of presidents such as @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1 and various other there has always been a war under the surface and it's name was censorship. It went further than most would think. It went to files, books, music, and eventually movies and magazines. When @CAPS1 was president there was censorship with books and newspapers galor. The books would be censored when something was considered racist, un-american or even political. The newspapers would be censored when an article was considered political, racist, un-american, rude, kind and an other reason you could possibly think of. Another case of censorship was when a famous singer was not allowed to sing for the president and first lady because of her ethnic background. Finally the first lady's persuasion was enough to get her favorite singer to sing for her with one complication, the singer had to sing outside on the front steps instead of inside like past performers had.     The new victims that are falling to censorship is music, movies and magazines. Where the main reason why the past forms of liturature were to be censored was on ethnic backgrounds and racism; it has no been shifted to gay, straight, bi, lesbian and other sexualities. This @MONTH1 not effect some people, but it could change someone's life by helping then realize who they are. A sad part is that this could also go in reverse it could open an oppurtunity for bullying. Again no matter which side someone is on, somebody will lose.     To be completely honest I think that cecnsorship is completely and absolutely wrong, especially in libraries. When someone is in their childhood all of the way into their adulthood, they go to the library if they want to find a book, magazine, movie, song or even sometimes a newspaper. Should their eyes be shielded from what others think are wrong, offensive, stupid or unethical? I think not, I think that the information is put out there for a reason and should have it's own voice.",5.0,4.0,8.0

2,"Imagine that you are a middle school student going to the library to check-out your favorite book.  When you go to find the book, you realize that it is no longer there; the book was removed from the library because it was believed to offensive.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because authors have freedom of speech and press, censorship is based off opinions, and censorship affects everyone within a community.     A part of living in the @LOCATION1 is having freedoms such as the freedom of press and the freedom of speech.  Those freedoms apply to everyone.  Censoring a book is like taking away those freedoms from the author.  Their book is their voice and no ones voice should have to be silenced.  Some books that are censored are not written by @CAPS1 authors, but that does not mean that the books should be taken away.  The books still represent some person's feelings and beliefs in the world and those books might relate to someone who is living in @LOCATION1.     When books are chosen to be censored, it is because of a person's opinion and opinions vary greatly from person to person.  Some people live a very sheltered life which would result in an opinion that many books are offensive and inappropriate for students to be reading.  Other opinions can be based off of religion or politics.  If people with these opinions are allowed to remove and censor all books they found inappropriate, there would be nothing left for children to read.     Parents usually pass their opinions onto their children and this will affect what they read and watch.  While these opinions should be respected, they should not affect the books and children within the school.  If a parent tries to remove a book from a library, another parent will try to keep it in the library.  Instead of a meeting with the board and an argument that goes along with it, parents should only enforce their rules within their homes.  The parents should sit down with their children and explain their rules and expectations about what their children should and should not read.  This way the children will know their boundaries and it will not affect anyone else within the community.         Censorship affects all people everywhere: it affects authors, students, parents, etc.  When books become censored, opinions clash and arguments begin.  Censorship should not be allowed because it goes against the the rights we as @CAPS2 are given, there are too many opinions to be able to satisfy, and it affects so many people.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship in libraries can be not only a benefit but a loss as well. Censoring books in a library is understandable when it comes to offense, but it is also difficult to satisfy everyone when it is based on just that. If libraries allowed any person to remove items that they find offensive, there wouldn't be much that a library would have left on the shelves. Everyone has different opinions and are offended in different ways, so censorship could benefit people, but it could also be a disadvantage for others.     As a standard citizen, I think that censorship in libraries is not a good idea. If a library censored every item that offended someone, there wouldn't be many things that they could reveal uncensored. There are things that some people @MONTH1 find inappropriate in important pieces of literature, things that are an important part of history and such. I think that if a library was to have a rule on censorship, it should be limited and made so that people will understand the guidelines. For instance, if there were some extremely vulgur context within some items, the library should have a designated section for those pieces and it should have some kind of sign or warning letting people know what they are getting themselves into. A library should also organize its' layout so that there are different sections for each level of maturity, such as adult, teen, children, or something along those guidelines. I don't think that censorship is a bad thing, but I also think that it should only be taken to a certain degree that can somewhat satisfy everyone.     All in all, library censorship depends on how the management feels the library needs to be ran. Many libraries can be ran in many different ways when it comes to censorship, but I don't feel that everytime someone takes offense to a piece of work that the library contains they should remove it from thier contents. Censorship can benefit many people if they get their way so that they feel more comfortable knowing what they are going to see when they get an item, but it can also be a loss to those that wish to explore and learn new things; a process that a library is supposed to be used for.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"You Can't @CAPS1 That On @CAPS2     I don't think that certain materials should be moved from shelves because others don't like them. To speak bluntly about it I would have to @CAPS1 if you find it offensive deal with it. We still have that right as @CAPS3 citizens don't we? Once more, why should others have to miss out on something that could potentially help them in some way just because you see its vulgar?      To go into depth I would like to state that what people believe to be offensive to others was created by an immature society. It is a wonder why we don't know everyone in the world personally seeing how everyone likes to get into others business. Hypocrites are the only people who would be supportive of something such as this. If you would let me take it deeper; you can find fault in any and everything the world has to offer if you look for it. But who would be the inconsideraste narcasistic asshole to do such? I'll explain who.     You might've heard of the recent @PERSON2 incident if not I'll elaborate. @PERSON2 was going to be on the childrens show @CAPS4 @CAPS5. As a childhood fan this was a very big deal to her she explained it as being probably the best thing to happen to her. But while shooting the show @PERSON4 wore a strapless sundress and someone became 'offended.' The show was never released and her dream of being on one of her favorite childhood shows was crushed. Parents @CAPS1 she was too suductive and her clothing could be chalked up as too sexual for children. Yes, that is what I said you don't have to reread it. My argument is this; if I wanted to be ignorant and trash @CAPS2 I could very easily do it. Some examples of this are as follows. @PERSON1 is way too sexual for a cartoon movie with a @NUM1 rating. Ariel the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be changed immediatly because she only wears clam shells over her breast. Tinkerbell's attire should be changed because her dress is way too short. @PERSON3 the iconic female cartoon character looks like a prostitute.      All of the characters above are characters seen by children or are well know be children and adults. What is the difference between them and @PERSON5? Some mighjt @CAPS1 for one she's not a cartoon character but we do have a word for people who have a fetish for cartoon characters. I won't go into more detail on that but just know it makes no difference. No one would even dare to tell @CAPS8 that their characters can be seen as vulgar and not very child friendly. So neither should @PERSON2 be said to be vulgar. If you haven't already become offended and are still reading allow me to shower you with more interlectual reasons. I like to call these reasons common sense.      My first reason is the same sundress that @PERSON4 wore is being sold in children sizes. So it's ok when a child wears it, hell you could probably @CAPS1 its cute. But when a woman wears the same dress you @CAPS1 it's sexual. What kind of insolent moronic thing is that? If the dress is seen as sexually explecit when women wear it then it is no longer fit to be worn by @CAPS6 girls.     My second reason is that @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a childrens show. This means none of those children are going to pay attention to how sexy the cast is. They are going to be enjoying the humor, lights, and music. And anyone who tries to @CAPS1 otherwise is the exact definition of the word idiot. I don't remember most of the episodes of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 let alone what the characters were wearing.     And my final reason is you have to be some kind of pervert to watch a childrens show just to see how the women look. That is the prime example of having no decentcy or morals. This also tells me how hypocritical these parents are. This means they went to the show and instead of listening to the message that was being sent they had their eyes all over @PERSON4.      In conclusion I would have to @CAPS1 no one has the right to judge others by any means. Now am I saying you should be able to go to your local library and rent some pornography; not at all. But I am saying is people need to stop trying to be some uptight about simple things. Nothing in this world is done without reasoning this goes double for books, movies, magazines, and music. No one will write a book just to write it. There is always a meaning to it and for you to try and take that book off of the shelves because it offends you sickens me. Bottom line if you find it offensive deal with it within your family. Don't try to speak for everyone and don't try to censor everyone",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"I don't believe that there should be the removal of offensive materials because there always is a person that is offended by everything. If there was the removal of all offensive materials, there would be no information to read, listen to, or view. If the content is offensive, then they should put an age limit on it. Just like if a movie has a lot of violence, it would be rated @CAPS1 and only people over the ages of @NUM1 would be allowed to view it. It should be used with all the media we have around us, like barriers on songs that have explicit lyrics in them or books with foul language in them.                     There should be at the very least a system to reenforce this idea. It would keep the easily offended people happy and the ones who use the media at a content level. It would just be obsured to keep the people who want to view it from watching the videos and watching the movies with dirty things in them. The inability to access such materials would cause a big uproar in the national public. It would anger the public to the point of not buying media related things.                            People would stop buying @CAPS2's and @CAPS3's. Then the economy would be crappy because of the loss in the revenue of the @CAPS2's, @CAPS3's, and all of the other countless offensive materials.I believe that it would be wrong to take away the very thing that this country relies upon because then the country would be in the toilet.

2,"In my opinion I do not think that certain materials should be taken out of libraries for any reason no matter what they are. If something is really bad and people do not like it that doesn't mean we should deny the people of our society the right to learn about it. Whether the libraries mix the material in with all of the other books in the library or make a section devoted to offensive material, I still think libraries should carry any material made with information that can be used to learn.     There are probably a lot of arguments that you can use to try to say that we should not put certain things in libraries, but there are also a lot of reasons on why we should put them in libraries. I will start with saying that we live in america where we have rights that represent freedom. We have the right to learn about whatever we want no matter if it be good or bad.      Next I will talk about why books, music, etc., should not be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. If something is found offensive than that means someones opinoion has been used negatively towards something that they dont like. If we were to start taking stuff out of libraries just because we thought they were offensive, then there would be nothing left in any library because everything in there would be found offensive to at least one person. So just because someone or even more than just one person finds something offensive, it doesn't mean we shouldn't let people learn about it.     Now I will give an example on why it would be a terrible idea to take material that is offensive to some people out of libraries. In the @CAPS1.S.A we had a horrible tradegy occur on @DATE1. Terrorist came to our country with only one thing on there minds and that one thing was to destroy us. If you thought what I just wrote was something interesting and you wanted to learn about it then I would tell you to go for it. But what if all offensive material got taken out of libraries and there was no way for you to research it or find out what had happened on that day. Yes, this did offend millions of people when it happened, but we still have the right to learn about it.     So no, I do not think we should take any material out of any library no matter how offensive it @MONTH1 be. Learning is a very important thing to every living thing on this planet and to take the right to learn away from someone is just proposterous.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Some people consider that now in days theirs a lot of thing that are more offensive shown in movies and books; things that are shown in public libraries. And some of those people want to take out, all of those thing from the shelves. Why? Because they think that things like that are a good example for their childrens.     But in my personal opinion I think that no one has the right to take away from someone something they like to watch or read about. Because not all of the people think the same way. And because some people like to read or watch those type of things. I think that is very simple if you don't like a movie or a book just don't watch it or read it.",2.0,2.0,2.0
2,"There are many books on the shelves of libraries containing information about war, violence, have sexual content and other things that you @MONTH1 not want your child to read about, but you can not make it all go away.  If one person starts taking books off of the shelves of libraries, then everyone will want to do the same.  If there is a book that someone wants to read, then they should be allowed to read it.  It is that person's choice whether to read it or not, and it is not our place to judge them.       If you are someone that does not believe in violence or war then that is your choice.  That does not give you the right to be able to take away everything that teaches people about it.  Other people are curious about war, and want to know what it is all about.  War is apart of our world's history, and if you take that off the library shelves, then it is like you are taking away a big part of history.  Taking these types of books out our libraries, will result in taking these subjects out of our schools as well.  This would really hurt the kids of learning about history in their history classes.  You can not just take that away from them, and expect them not to find out about it.  They are going to learn about it someway, and books will help them understand it so much better.  Just becuase books contain information about war, it does not mean that they do not teach us about good things as well.  Yes, they @MONTH1 go into depth about the struggles and what war is all about, but they also teach us about overcoming struggles, coming together, and teamwork.       If one person begins to take books out of the libraries then so will everyone else.  It is like a monkey see, monkey do kind of effect.  Before you know it, all books will be out of the libraries and no one will be be able to read about anything.  Doing this would greatly affect your child's learning abilities in a horrible way.  Reading is the main way that kids learn in school, and without books it is almost impossible for your child to learn at all.  This would decrease the development of your child's learning, and their skills would not be at their full potential.     If you find a book offensive, that does not mean that you can just take it away from others.   People @MONTH1 want to learn about things that you do not, and that does not give you the right to take that away from them.  Let people read about what they want, it is completely their choice and their choice only.  It is understandable that you @MONTH1 not want your child to read a selection of books in the library, but do not take that ability from someone else.  There should be no censorship in our libraries.  It is a great privilage to be able to read something you are curious about, and it would be horrible to snatch that away from others.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"No I don't believe that those certain materials should be removed. Sometimes its good to have those things on the shelf because most of those things are telling whats going on around the world and what some people are interested in.     Books are something to read and learn and also to refresh your mind depending on what you are reading. I read books that interest me such as horror, action, and poems. The thing I read could be different from what others read. Thats why it should be a variety of things on shelves because its always people that have a different taste of books.     Music is somthing everybody listen to. You have those who listen to rap, hip hop, r&b, rock, and also gossip. Thats why there are different radio sations for those who have different taste of music.      Magazines are facts and someones opinion that is about someone famous or someone that have alot attention drawn to them. Its also alot of news reporters that post pictures and get some news about them.     Thats why I say no because everybody does not read, watch, or listen to the samething. That why it should be a variety of things for everyone to enjoy what interest them",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship Does @ORGANIZATION1 has always been an issue in society. Dictating what media is in citizens reach would rarely result in good thing. Examples of this can be found in literature, such as @CAPS1 @NUM1 and in the real world example, the population of modern day @LOCATION1. Getting rid of all offensive material would prevent people from having a choice of what they read. It would also eliminate some of the most important pieces of literature in history from the shelves.      For many people, having a choice is very important. Gay rights and abortion political issues are perfect examples of society's need for choice. Taking away all said offensive books, movies, magazines and more would loudly take away the choice that people have to read them. If one wants to read To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3 @CAPS4, he or she should be able to have access to that information, even if others @MONTH1 find the racism themes and language in the dialogue and narration offensive.      As adults and young adults, people are responsible for themselves, and have control over their actions. If one doesnt want to read a book or magazine that contains offensive or inappropriate material, he or she should maintain this responsibility and put the book down and find something more suitable for his or her taste in the vast ocean of books in the library; that is the purpose of the library. In addition, book and movie reviews are easily accessible on the internet. A reliable resource commonsense.com. On this website, thousands of books, movies and television series are reviewed by parents and rated based on content. It is free, and almost anybody could visit this site before venturing to the library to make a selection appropriate for his or her self.     In a quote from author @PERSON1, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. @PERSON1's statement is completely true; @ORGANIZATION1 has their own opinion of what is inappropriate or offensive. By the time these people all express these feelings, so many books with so many different contents and topics will be removed from the shelf. An example of this is @CAPS5; his work will be studied and marveled by many for years to come. However, in several of his plays, sexual innuendo and gestures are used. This doesn't make him any less of a poet or writer at all. People that enjoy his work should still have access to it, despite others' opinions of it.       By censoring the media on the library's shelves, one is deprived of the choice of what he or she takes in as well as easy access to some of the most noteable pieces of literature. The option of eliminating these materials should be avoided by all to keep literature alive and easily accessable",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I think that everyone is different, everyone has thier own opinions, and everyone is interested in different things. Who is to say what is aproprite and whats not, because there are alot of people in the world, and what I said aplies to all of them. It is true there would be no books to read. It would also cause alot of fighting over the simple fact that some one had someone eleses boooks removed ect.     So no I do not agree with books being taken off shelves. What is being published in these books they are refering to cant be any nore harmfull than the nightly news or whats happening in the world. So live and let live there is no one that is forcing you to check out the books you dont prefer.     This would just be another reason for the states to fight, and bicker amungst ourselves.

2,"Do you think that the library is an interesting place when you can decide if you want to read something bloody or even something perverted? Do you think the library should only hold kid books and some educational books? The library should be a place for you to adventure, believe, and create in.     The library is a place where people that write what they think is interesting in books for others to enjoy. Free publication of speech right? Well if you get rid of everything that some people think is offensive, then you might as well get rid of the whole library. No one is going to agree with everyone. I mean some educational books, like the ones about @LOCATION1, have pictures of half naked men and women that walk around with their breast showing, but that's just @LOCATION1 and they are trying to inform you about their culture.     I understand somethings, like half naked girls on the car magazines, can be tossed out. Those type of things are pointless and if some teenage boy wants one of those magazines, they can buy it at a store. You need to understand, some of the offensive stuff you read is helpful. It's no ones fault but your own if you pick up a book and start reading it and then figure out there is some offensive stuff in it. If you dnt like it don't pick it up, but don't make them take all the offensive stuff out.      Think about the old people, they still like some romance in their lives, so they like to read romantic novals. Believe me I have read some of those and they all are not so religious, but it's what the older generation likes. What about the younger, hopeless teenagers? They love to read about killers and muders. Do you think that these books are all rainbows? I don't think so, but at least the average teenager is reading.     Coming to my conclusion, I just want you to think about your favorite series or author. Are they family friendly, or do you like to be naughty at times? Remember, you wouldn't want them taking your favorite books away from you.",3.0,3.0,4.0

2,"Yes, i do feel that certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the libraies.Some of the things in the libraries can cause children, teen, or even adults to do, learn, or hear the wrong things. I feel that book such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' are not a very good choice for reads of any age because, it entertains witch craft and things of the devil.I believe that book like that are encouraging people to want to try and experiment things some reads do read things like that for fun the take it heart and try to become the book in a way, which could lead to problems.     There are, differnet types of magazines. Some are ok and some are not. I think that out of all the things the magazines should constantly be check. There are ne w issues out atleast every week and some @MONTH1 contain certain pictures or articles that are not right for the libraries. I think that this is a verty bigissue because too many times i have went past something that I felt were offensive.       Some of the movies can be classified as inapropriate as a well. There are many diffrent movie out,but i don't think that certain ones should be allowed in the libraries. Some movies have to much sexual content as well as volgur language. Not every movie is ment to be put on library shelves. I think that what ever movies or books that people would like to read or whatch that are not appropriate should come from the libraies. Many differnt types of people with different beliefs pass through libraries. Some @MONTH1 feel the same as i do.     There should be a nice variety of music in the libraies but i think that it should be screened before put on the shelves to the public. Some songs either have too much bad laguage, downgrade women, bad laguage, sex, or talk about killing, robbing and or stealing. The full @CAPS3 should be heard by one other head librarians orr who every is over that deparment,just because one or two songs sond okay or the beging does'nt sound that bad doesn't meant that it is still appropriate for a library setting.     In conclusion, I strongly agree that some of the  books,music,magazines, and movies in libraries should be properly reviewed. If a person happenes to come past something in appropriate I think the shoul notify someone in charge of tha section so that it can be removed and replaced by something more suitable. You never know who is looking at the things that  are displayed on the libraries shelves it could be children, teen, or adult. Thats why I agree that cetain things should be removed from the libraries because some of things are offensive.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries from all around the world consist of materials that are found offensive in many ways.  These books are being looked at in many views, by children, teenagers, teachers and even parents. Parents have to wonder what their child is researching at school and if things are being talked about, that should not be talked about. Censorship should be happening in certain libraries around the world but in some libraries you should take it upon yourself to stay away from those certain materials.     Children at an elementary school should be involved with 'The @ORGANIZATION1' books, or materials on animals. No child should be looking or reading materials about sex or drugs at such a young age. Censorship of those materials would be encouraged, not only by teachers but the parents of those children going home and telling mom and dad about sex. Im sure thats not the reader the author intended on reading the material but sometimes it happens and could lead them into trouble.     Teenagers on the other hand are a little more grown up. By saying 'a little more grown up' I mean, they are considered to be smart about what they do in life and the choices they make. In the library at my school you are going to find those materials that invovle sex and drugs but as a teenager myself, I know what is wrong and right and take out of it the lesson the book @MONTH1 have on me. Take drugs for a instants. If I start reading a book about a teenager who was invovled in sports but started doing drugs and lost a scholarship by doing so. I would think this book is appropiate because it shows what drugs could do to a dream you @MONTH1 have. I love playing basketball and by starting drugs, I could end my whole career in a few seconds. Teenagers around the world need to read what authors have to say about their experiences and learn from them.      Overrall, I do not believe that authors made their materials to encourage students and others to start doing things such as sex and drugs. I take it upon myself to stay away from these materials but sometimes things pop up in books and you just have to go on and not make a big deal about it. Those things are part of life and we need to handle situations even if that means not banding certain materials from libraries. It would help many concerns people have but also your taking away the opportunity of showing the teenagers and even others what the real world is like and what to be aware of.      I believe there should be a line drawn to where those materials are, considering the age of people looking at them. Also the surroundings of the location.  Like at a highschool where students are pushing to get through high school to graduate and go on to college, not to take the day to read about topics that could get them into trouble and ruin something great from happening to them. Not letting sex and drugs take their chances of going on in a sport, ruining their lives, or ruining the life of someone else. If those certain materials are left in libraries children should be kept away from them,  and teenagers need to think about what they are reading and make good decisions",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Do you find that censorship is a part of your everyday life? It is awful how many times a day someone hears or sees someone use a swear word or some type of offensive gesture. There are lots of book, music, movies, and magazines that use inappropriate language or something that might offend someone else.     I believe books should not be removed from the shelves if it has vulger words in the story. Its a part of the story and sometimes the only way to convey the message is to get someones attention by using those type of words. It is used to tell the story the way it was. It wasnt intended to make anyone feel offended. I would suggest to do away with some swear words but not all of them.     No matter what type of music you listen to it could be rap, country, hip-hop, or r&b you know that there will be censored words in the songs. I think a lot of rap and hip-hop in the modern day has changed tons. It seems like every song you listen to you can not go more than two or three words with out someone swearing. Censored music should be done away with! You do not want the youth of @LOCATION1 to learn these words at a young age. I think most parents would agree that they do not want their kids listing to this type of music.     Magazines are available almost anywhere thses days. Young children have access to them at almost all times. Those kids @MONTH1 see famous people who they @MONTH1 look up to drinking, giving people the middle finger, or smoking. Kids will see that and want to try it. Magazines should not put anything of that nature in any articles. Like i said before, you do not want the young of @LOCATION1 to learn these type of actions.     It seems like movies started it all. From shooting people to swearing, movies have everything we do not want. If someone takes a child to a movie they will be influenced by the movie and maybe do something that is not right. If movies were less graphic and cut down on the swearing it would make a difference. Movies dont have to be done away with just limit the age range to where young people can not watch graphic movies.     I think libraries are the culprit of it all. The offer everything such as: access to computers, magazines, movies, books, and even music. They don't check everything to make sure there isn't anything censored. They allow just about anyone to check out anything. If the libraries would check more often maybe we would'nt have the issue of children of offending someone or saying swear words.     No matter if your for or against censored material being removed from the shelves you should realize the facts. Children of @CAPS1 or being surrounded by these things everyday. Its almost impossible to avoid, but maybe if we did away with censored items you could see the difference with the children. The least @LOCATION1 could do is take this into account and try to remeber that censorship is all around, if everyone tried to avoid censored items there is no doubt that @LOCATION1 would be a better place",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Cencoring     @CAPS1 in the @LOCATION1 is something that seems quite unusual to me; we are given the @ORGANIZATION1 to practice what we believe in, do what we want (within legal boundaries), and live a free life, but we are subjugated to the mighty power of another @CAPS2 or a plathera of our own fellow @CAPS3 to @CAPS1? We are allowed @ORGANIZATION1 of speech but not the @ORGANIZATION1 to read, or watch, or even listen to something if another @CAPS2 says that they do not like\condone it? Are we truly as free as we believe?                           @CAPS1 on Books     @CAPS5 I am quite the reader myself, I believe that people are allowed to ban some materials, even if the majority of us like it. Books @MONTH1 be one of many ways that people can escape reality and enter tranquil serenity but @CAPS13 are some books that can be quite...whats the word....vulgar. Some books @MONTH1 have material that seem extremely prejudice to one person and an eyeopener to another, which @MONTH1 lead to that angry person issuing out a ban on that book for use of prejudice but for those people that have not yet seen that book @MONTH1 never experience the life changing words written inside. Say the ban was issued; how many people will know what say, @CAPS6 @CAPS7's @CAPS8 was, or @CAPS9, or the @CAPS10 @CAPS11? The easiest answer to the question, little to none. Say the ban was not issued; how many people would know the history that many people endured and fought to prevent the future from becoming and try to become a new after reading said book? The easiest answer to the question, many. In the book @ORGANIZATION1, you can read about how they read about what life @PERSON3 and the other @CAPS12 had to go through, and what how their own lives, compared to hers, was similar, but the difference they saw was that @PERSON3 was a prisoner with little to no hope for @ORGANIZATION1, they on the other hand have that oppurtunity and they remembered that book and it helped most of them to continue through life remembering that their own can never be as bad as hers. now if that angry persomn that was mentioned earlier saw this, do you think they would still like to issue that ban or do you think they would want that book to be broadcasted?                                       Music     I, myself, must admit that if I could ban some music, I would, but would that be fair to others that like that music? I do not think so; for example I have a friend who loves scream-o, but he hates rap, I on the other hand hate scream-o and love rap, so would I ban scream-o if I could, no, why not, because I would not like if someone tried to ban the music I like, besides music gives people energy and makes their day better.                                       Movies     @CAPS13 are actors tyhat we all love and hate, but censorship on  movies because @PERSON1 or @PERSON2 is in it? C'mon. @CAPS5 some people view movies as prejudice or just horrible some do not. Tropic @CAPS14 for example had a black movie character who actually believed he was @CAPS15-@CAPS2 and this offened alot of people, but to some, myself is who @CAPS15-@CAPS2 it was quite the treat. Was the movie almost banned, yes, possibly, but @CAPS13 were some @CAPS15-@CAPS2 people who protested against the banning because they felt that it was fine; they did not break any boundaries in which we would feel offended but they kept it at a constant.     The moral of this story is to not judge a book by its cover (cliched I know but it works); @CAPS5 you hate hate something does not mean someone else does not so don't knock it until you try it",3.0,4.0,6.0

2,"Do you think that just because it would be harder to get that younger kids won't try to get it anyways? The books in the library are organized in sections adult and childrens. The younger kids should know that they shouldn't be in some sections. It's not the library's fault they look at the book their parents should tell them they can't not just the other adult in the library. Some high school students use some of that to do homework and projects.     Today more and more books, music, and magazines have inappropriate language and pictures. Parents should be aware of all of this and just because they don't like it doesn't mean somebody else don't enjoy it. The more people talk about how bad all of this stuff is in front of children is making them want to go look at it to see why and how it's so bad. Parents blame the library when their kids see these kinds of things in all these materials when it's not their fault, because when children come into the library they shouldn't have to have a babysitter. There are many different places for younger children to see these kinds of things, and just because its easier to see in certain places it's not the owner or managers fault they see it.      The library tries to seperate the books, the music, and the magazines. When the younger children see their older brothers and sisters looking, laughing, and joking about these things they want to see what it is as well. Parents don't blame their children it's easier to blame somebody they don't know. Some adults look at these thing and if they are all taken away then it's not doing anything but giving them a reason to look around for information. Eventually they will hear about it and go looking for books and whatever else they can find over what they hear. There are worse things on the internet then in books, songs, and magazines.      The internet has everything anybody can think of, and parents let their kids on the internet just as much as the let them go to the library. The internet is more descriptive and has more detail compared to any book. People all around the world put things on computers that they think most people wont see. They might do it to show friends and family that they don't see very often, because they live in a different state or whatever it is. If parents are okay with their kids to play on the internet why do they want reading materials taken away from people who can use them for school.     Parents act like just the younger kids are the only kids that look at these things, when some people use them for important matters. If these things are taken away form everybody becasue one kid does what they know they shouldn't it's not fair to the people who don't abuse their privileges. Why should people who use these things responsibly have to lose their privileges of using books and magazines if they look at them and don't destroy them and let younger kids that shouldn't see them look at them. Either way younger kids are going to see these kinds of things so why take them away from others that can use them responsibly.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In the world today not much is done to censor library items and this is wrong.  Censorship needs to happen because what if a random child picks up a book that is inappropraite for their age and they read the book, the book might give the reader the wrong idea.  In a time of increasing amounts of inapropraite behavior, censorship could be a key to stopping innapropraite behavior.       If a reader picks up a book and reads the book, the contents and text of that certian book @MONTH1 become an influence for the reader.  If a book showed how gang violence was benifical to society, the reader @MONTH1 develop an urge to join a gang, and the reader has no idea of what they are getting themselves into.  Books, movies, music, and magazines all influence the reader.  If a reader takes a magazine that is pornographic from the library, than the reader @MONTH1 begin to show an intrest in pornography, and develop an addiction to pornography.  All of these behaviors are innapropriate in today's society.  No matter what the case is a library should have censorship over its material, and take out all uncensored items that are deemed inappropriate for the reader from the libraries shelves.  Also, the libraries should be accountable for making sure the item that the reader is checking out is age appropraite.  By doing all of these things readers will be less likely to see inapropraite content and not be influenced by the wrong contents of a library item.     In the world today people are influence by friends, family, and television.  However, library materials can be just as influencial as all the other items listed above.

2,"Everyone has their own beliefs. A library is provided for anyone to come and check out books, magazines, etc. However, those could all contain offensive contents.

If they're younger, they should have permission from their parents to check something out. That way, nobody is disrespected.      There should be separate sections in the library.

In my school, we can check out whatever book we want. I have read some with words/graphics that would be offensive to some readers. In my opinion, if you think the book would offend you in any way, then you shouldn't read it.      Everyone has a right to write what they want. I think it would be wrong to not sell or provide books from certain authors just because of the offensive words, etc. it contains. Libraries should be like the movie theater, in some way.

I think everyone has been on both sides of this predicement, i know people have said and/or things that have offended me, and i problably have offended someone as well.     Offending people with a sense of wanting to hurt them is @CAPS1, but my friends and I are all about the same when it comes to this subject, we joke around and 'cut up' alot, and sometimes people take offense to that, but we really dont mean to piss them of, we were just kidding. I am the type of person who will tease someoneand stuff, but that means i like u, so if i dont mess around with u, i problaby dont care for you to much.     I try to think that people arent really as mean as they are and that they were reallyjust kidding, but i know people are hatefull by nature. People who try to hurt other peoples self asteem are not good people and should be in more trouble than they get in for picking on people.     From @CAPS2 i have seen in school is that people, I think try to be offended by things as a reason to get into a fight or cause trouble and be the center of attention. Its sad that people resort to that but its happenig every day in my school.' @CAPS2, u called me a fag, im gonna beat ur ass,' is a term I have heard to many times to bear any longer.

I do not want my children to ever be exposeed to that kind of negativity. That is for adult's only, not for your little childrin. All @CAPS1 @CAPS2's should take off the shelfs anything that they would not want their children to see.      Imagine going into a @CAPS2 and see some ten year old boy looking at a bad magazine. It would break your heart and make you think wow that kid's to young to be reading about bad stuff like that. All @CAPS2's should take that into mind not only does it make the @CAPS2 look bad it also makes our community look bad. To let little kids see bad images their not ready for.     If @CAPS1 librarys are going to promote that kind of behavior then they shold make you be eighteen. Or make you have a parents consint not just say here ya go without their parents even knowin that they got it. Every @CAPS2 should monitor what they put out on the shelves.     To sum up my collusions all @CAPS1 @CAPS2's should monitor what they view to the @CAPS1 to borrow. They need to think about if their preants seen them reading it or watching it would they get mad?

Secondly, I believe there is nothing wrong with the censor movies, books, and ect.

2,"Are there book that you have read to make you feel offended? I have not read any offending books in my life but other people have. Do you think we should take books off the shelf that offend or taint people?     Some libraries have more books than others. Most of the books are read by the librarians. The librarians might think that some books do not offend them but they don't know what has gone on in other people lives. Perhaps, someone had a family member die and the book made them feel uncomfortable.     If someone is offended by the book should the library have to take it off the shelf? I don't think they should have to because that book might not offend someone else so they could enjoy the book better.     I truely don't think it would be fair to some people who enjoy reading books. For the simple reason that it is going to offend many people whether they like it or not. When you take a book off the shelf because it offended someone you will not be able to augment anotherone on the shelf because it will offend another person.     If I ever read a book and it offended me I would go to the library and check out another book. I just say there is no need to blow it out of proportion. It is only a book and it shouldn't offend someone that bad.     That is why I think you should not take books off the shelf if they offend someone. It will not offend everyone who reads it.

2,"Acoording to the quote by Katherine Paterson, @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 has, or should have the right to remove a book or magazine or etc. off a shelf if @CAPS1 finds it offensive. There are bad books out there, and we could or our childern could be reading these books too. But do I think we should just be able to reccomend the removal of these books or to remove them ourselves off shelves? No i don't, I think that everyone has the freedom to do as they please, within the law of course. So if a kid, or an adult sees a book that might look offensive to the naked eye they should not pick it up and look at it. And if they do then they cant complain or ask to have these books removed off shelves. Kids know between right and wrong and so do adults, so they know what kind of books, or any kind of situations they can/cant handle. The only time i would ever reccomend a book to be pulled off a shelf or have removed for good is when a school makes you read a book that would offend you, or your culture, or ways of life. And this isnt with just books this is with music, movies, magazines, etc. But my main opinion of this whole subject is that we know what we can handle and if we cant handle a book, or a song, or a magazine, then we shouldnt consider looking at, or listening to, or watching. That is my opinion about weather or not i think that a book, or a song, or a movie should be removed if it is found offensive",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Sometimes I ask myself the same exact question. I ask if I think something is appropriate or not. People usually don't have a choice if they wanna see inappropriate things or not. It is just shown to them in an advertisement, article, or even said in a song. At the same time, some people like to see these things and are immediately attracted to them. That is why people put these things in advertisements.     Most advertisements that you would see on the television these days include sexual content or bad language which shouldn't be allowed. The reason you would find these things in an advertisement is that most people think its funny or they really like it. I personally like to see some inappropriate things in an advertisement but sometimes they get carried away with what they put in them. The ones that get too carried away are the advertisements with sexual content in it. The viewer should either be warned or not see the content that is in the advertisement. If they don't want to see it then it shouldnt be on there.     Overall, I think that advertisements need to cool down. And by cool down, I mean they shouldn't be able to show or say as much as they do in the commercial, article, book, or song. There could be little children looking at your advertisement and getting in trouble with their parents and possibly ruining their future. Allthough there are some parents out there that don't mind if their children see these things. I personally would think that it was unacceptable for the children to see it. They usually do not have a choice to see or hear the explicit content in these advertisements. Advertisements should not be allowed to show this content if there are people out there that don't want to see it.",4.0,4.0,7.0

A book, or a song @MONTH1 have words in it that is racist but look at it thought the book writer, or the song makers eyes.     I also think that book from/about the slavery days should be in schools, so that students can become more educated about the past history. And also how colored people lived their lives as slave workers. I also think that if all the books are getting taken off the shelfs, what do the people do if they want to read a book that someone thought was a bad book, or what if the person took a reading in the wrong way? How is that fair for someone else that @MONTH1 have wanted to read that specific book?

So many opions and so many different answers, but we all seem to continue to bump heads. In my opinion I would try to help everyone out but, I would  get rid of things that are offensive and not appropiate for children, but we can't just get rid of everything that is pretty important to others then we would have bigger problems. So how do we fix this problem?      A great place to start at is the public library, everyone goes there so anyone is aloud in and out. So to make things a lot easier for the children to not see the inappropiate and offensing things, they should put the books and magazines in the back were there can not be seen by them. So now everyone is happy, they all get @CAPS1 they want after all.      When it comes to other areas it will be a hole different story, we can't just tell them to put the stuff in the back, because those are the things that they want to sell to the world. People can have many arguments of how they should remove it, but at the end they wont. Even though I also agree they are bad but we can't just please ourselves.We can try to make them put them in an area where kids can not see but it wont last for a long period of time. A better solution for this would to just keep the children from looking at these things and teach them good from wrong, because kids will be kids and will try to find a way to look at things they know they shouldn't be looking at.

2,"Libraries are a very useful source of information. They hold information on the past, and they also hold fictional stories. Many libraries throught the @LOCATION1 are being censored for material that is seen as inapropriate. My belief on this topic is that libraries should not be censored.     Books are the main source of information in a library. If a library were to have a censorship over books, then the information in the library might decrease. Books are an important recource when studying, or when reading for fun. There would be a smaller selection of material on the shelf if the libraries were censored. If libraries were censored almost every single book would come off the shelf, because of all of the different ethnic groups, and religion groups, almost everything could be found as offensive. This would defeat the purpose of the library being a place for information on all different subjects.     Music is a growing and popularizing way to express and convey your likes and dislikes. Music is an important part of culture and history. Libraries have music for the purpose of educating the minds of people who havent experienced the type of culture that they are studying, or that they are interested in. There are so many different types of music that it is almost impossible to find music that is not offensive to some people. Music can also help younger generations understand what life might have been like in the past. If Music were to be censored then younger generations of people wouldnot have the complete access of information that they deserve to learn from.     Movies are also a very essential part of culture. Movies can be one of the most useful tools for learning about a specific topic. Movies can not only explain what people think about a specific topic, but they can also show them visually. Movies are a very important tool in a learning process. If movies were to be censored in libraries people would have a harder time accessing the information that they need. Censoring movies would deprive people of being able to experience a specific topic of information in a new way. Some movies @MONTH1 be offensive to people, but to other people they are a good learning experience.      My opinion on the topic of censoring libraries information is that we should not censor libraries. Books, music, and movies are a very important tool to be able to utilize to our advantage. Books have been around for the longest time and have helped explain how events in the past might have occured. Music is a very important tool for understanding the culture of a different ethnicity, or understanding the culture of a different country. Movies can help the person to experience the information they are trying to learn in a new way that music, or books could not do. If any of these materials were to be censored in libraries, the result would be that people would not have the full access to information that they deserve.",4.0,4.0,7.0

So why have someone else control you? Some reasons that I do not agree with everyone else taking things off the shelf that they think is offensive is because some people might not think it is offensive, the other reason is because the parents of the children can always control what they read instead of controlling what everyone else reads, and the last reason is because if we control everything there won't be any more music, book, or even movies.     Wouldn't you like to read a book with out someone saying it's offensive, and taking it off the shelves. Well, I would. If we take every book off the shelf that someone thinks is offensive we might not have any books to read. We won't have books to do reports on, or read even for fun. We should not let everyone else control what we read even if they think it's offensive, plus if you think it's offensive you dont have to read it.     So some kids like watching horror movies or reading dramatic things in the magazines. The parents can control that if they don't approve of it. Why does everyone else have to suffer because it's taken off the shelf by the parents, it should not be that way. I know kids can be kids but come on, they are kids you can control what they read, watch, or listen to.      What do you think the world would be like without music, movies, or even books? It would be probably boring. Would you want to be sitting at home without some kind of music to listen to or even movies to watch?

Like for an example for teenagers, they can read about losing weight if they are big or not because some most people think if you want to fit in then you can't be big.

If people are so affended then they shouln't go to the section where they found that novel, magazine, record or film.

Sould materials that expresses oneself or something be removed? No it shouldn't, because those authors, publishers, artists, and @CAPS1 worked very hard to get there voice out to the world.

Here is a story that happened when i was younger in elementary school.  @DATE1 visits happened frequently in @CAPS1 family when i was younger.  @CAPS1 family and I used to get up around nine and eat breakfast.  After that we would go up to the @ORGANIZATION1 for our weekly book that we got every week.  As soon as we pulled in I remember racing out of @CAPS1 moms car and sprinting to the door.  Walking in was amayzing!  The @ORGANIZATION1 was the name and it had marble statues, polished wooden floors, stairways leading up and down.  There were never ending waves of books.       But one day was different then the rest.  There was a door that had adult only written above it.  When a youngling comes across a gigantic door that lets only certain people in, you know they're going to be curious.  I said, '@PERSON1 have you ever been in there?'  @CAPS1 brother replied, 'No, it says only adults can go in there.'  '@CAPS2 since no one is around do you want to go check it out?' I said.  'We better not mom would be furious if she caught us.' he responded.        '@CAPS3 me you will not go in there,' @PERSON1 said.  I promised him and walked to the kid books.  Nothing was going to stop me from going in that door.  Sneaking @CAPS1 way from bookshelf to bookshelf i found @CAPS1 way back to the door.  Walking in was like something I've never seen before.  Row after row of naked people and censored videos.        Apparently @CAPS1 brother had seen me go in and was waiting for me to come out.  @PERSON1 had been in there before kind of the how I did.  Curious, rebellious and doing your own thing is exciting but can get you into some serious trouble.  Because @CAPS1 brother went and told @CAPS1 mom which made her go ballistic.  No one under eighteen should be aloud in there she said.  Grounding me for a week was punishment enough.       So reading this story is a perfect example of why you should not have that stuff.  It's simply inapropriate for children period.  As you become more mature and are able to handle nudity and censored items like that then you have the opportunity to do so.

I dont think you would be to happy about it. what im trying to say is just cause you don't like something doesn't mean that someone else don't like it and won't have fun with it. thats why i don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I personally believe that anyone can write whatever they want.  If someone finds a book on the shelf that they find to be offensive, they don't have to read it.  If they choose to read a book that they don't like then it's their fault for reading it.  If the author of a book found out a local book store had removed the book they wrote, I think they would be pretty mad and they would possibly stop writing because they think people don't like what they write.     You shouldn't worry about censorship if it doesn't relate to you personally.  The only way someone should be able to remove your work from being published or released is if the story talks about someone in particular in a bad way enough for the person to find it offensive.  One time I was at my local book store and a younger lady was looking down at a book that had a title that offended her.  She went and told the librarian and the next day the book had been removed from the library.  You shouldn't be able to do that.  If the lady found the book to be offensive she shouldn't have looked at it, she should have just ignored the book and kept on with what she was doing.     In my opinion, censorship is not acceptable.  People should be free to write what they want.  The author of the book shouldn't be blamed for writing offensive material, it should be the person finding it to be offensive that has the punishment.  If you don't like the book then don't read the book.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I think that certain books should stay on the shelf. One of the reason's that I say this is because they help us understand things better. Books also help us locate something if we can't find it on our own. Some books on the shelves @MONTH1 also be very old, or possibly falling apart.      Books @MONTH1 be very useful in helping us understand things better. For instance, if we need help on homework we could look it up in a book. They also help us understand things better by giving details about something.      Some books have been very useful in helping us find things. Like, if you can't find a street or something some books have maps that shows how to get there. They also help us locate where we can find answers at if we can't find them.      Books have been around for many years. So some books @MONTH1 need to stay on the shelf because they are very old. People might have books that have been passed down to them, and the books might be falling apart. These books @MONTH1 also need to stay on the shelf because they don't want them to get ruined somehow.      Why do you think that books should stay on shelves? Well, these are just some of the few reason's why I think books should stay on the shelves. Many other people might have more reason's than what I do",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe the libraries should keep the books, movies, music, and magazines on the shelves. They are enhancing the vocabulary and minds of children and adults. People would understand more about the world we live in. We are free to express our feelings in books, movies, music, and magazines.     It enhances the mind and vocabulary of kids and adults. When we read something from the magazine we usually want to share that information with other friends, kids read @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because @CAPS1 interest them. Back in elementary school I know for a fact that my friends would only get @CAPS1 @CAPS2 from the school because they didn't have to pay for it. Libraries shouldn't remove the shelves at schools or public libraries. Kids' @CAPS5 magazines are good for classes at schools as well because they have straight facts and teachers could give quizzes on them, and it gives a better understanding to kids. Adults can get novels and magazines from public libraries and they can teach them stuff that they have never heard or seen of. It could enhance everybodies mind and vocabulary. We do it everyday.     People would understand what world we live in, and how we are affecting it. @NUM1 is a good example for this. I was in kindergarden when @NUM1 happened. I didn't know anything about it until the @NUM3 grade. Everybody was still talking about it and I felt dumb for not knowing what evrybody was talking about. So i got a @CAPS5 magazine and read the whole thing cover to cover, I read about @NUM4 of them until I found out what it was. When I found out I about cried because I was little and I was starting to put peices together. I went home and asked my parents if we had family over there, they said no. I still felt bad. It heightened my emotions and I found out we were at war. It makes us who we are today with a library and all the information from the books, magazines, movies, and music.     We have the freedom to express ourselves in whatever shape or form, but mainly in music and movies. Movies can creat a person and so can music. SoI think only appropiate music shoud be on the shelves in the library.     I guess what i'm trying to say is @CAPS6 all the books. magazines, movies, music, etc. we wouldnt't be the people we are today. Would you be the person you are todaty @CAPS6 this stuff in your local library or school library? really, think about it.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Censorship is not only a problem that newspapers are facing and is becoming more prevalent in libraries and book stores. All across the country, book/music/movie carriers are taking certain books and other materials off the shelves that they deem inappropriate for their clients. The problem is, even if that book is taken out of a store, that doesn't mean is in accessable. Also,  shouldn't the library or media store simply move the books and materials so children @MONTH1 not get ahold of them. Whereas adults who @MONTH1 enjoy whatever that piece of entertainment @MONTH1 be, will be able to check it out or buy it, thus the stores or library don't lose any customers either.      Libraries are generally in charge of buying or ordering the books or other materials they want or chose to hold in their facility. Because they are giving this freedom, the administrators would already have an idea of what they would or wouldn't want to buy, depending on what they believe would be appropriate for anyone using the library. Therefore, the library shouldn't even have any material to be thought of as 'offensive' in their system. If something isn't generally accepted as offensive, the library would most likely carry it, and it would be up to the parents' discrestion to determine what their children are reading, not a library.       As for various stores selling books, or music, or movies, they should simply move the materials to an adult only section in the store, and/or make the customer produce an @CAPS1 in order to purchase that item. Though this @MONTH1 be a hassle, it prevent unnecessary censorship and infringement on our rights guaranteed by the @ORGANIZATION1. If this causes the sale of that item to go down, then many stores @MONTH1 not carry it, or the company would get the hint that their song, book, movie, magazine, etc. was too sketchy for the public, and possibly @MONTH1 prevent its likeness from reoccuring. The problem then just solves itself, and censorship doesn't have to come into play.     Another point, said in the quote from Katherine Paterson, states that even though you @MONTH1 want a book removed, if everyone removed a book they deemed inappropriate, then there would be no books left to buy or read. The same thought can be applied to the new music we listen to, where if we all were able to prevent a song from being recorded based on whether or not we find it offensive, we'd have not music, and such follows with movies and magazines. The problem with censorship is that there is no clear cut line on where to stop, meaning if one thing gets censored, it could end up being completely changed or completely removed. This could also lead to censorship bleeding over into that genre of book or music or movie, and that whole genre would end up censored or cut. There is just no clear cut end.     As a person who has been or is a teenager, one would no that with today's access to the @CAPS2, censorship inadequate. Even if a child is prevented from reading or listening to something, now days they can just look it up online. The stores and libraries @MONTH1 try to rid of offensive material, but in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, once it's out there, it's out there. Kids will find ways to access something even if they can't legally buy it or aren't given permission to read it. Therefore, it becomes the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids read and listent to, and to install their own limits on the @CAPS2 they receive, and not the store or library who merely carry what will either make money or attract customers.     There is only so much that can be done to shelter people from offensive material. The fact is, offensive material exists, has existed and will probably always exist. Everyone has a right to publish or read what they will, and the opposite (not publish or read what they will) is true. The cold truth is, parents now will have to step up their ideals for what their child is exposed to, rather than rely on society to do it for them. We are all given the right to read, say, and publish what we want, and even if we don't agree with the material someone else has produced, we don't have a right to completely censor it. The best we can do and hope for is sheltering our children from offensive material, which is really no responsibility of a store and little responsibility of a library. As a newspaper, the views on censorship are very harsh, and should be in any case of censorship in any other print or media setting.",5.0,4.0,8.0

2,"Censoring anything these days is a huge deal. To me it seems the stuff we are censoringhas already become a part of our everyday lives. I can't even walk down my high school hall way with out hearing someone droppin the @CAPS1-bomb. I mean about one fourth of my school has some sexual experience already; @CAPS2 of my school has either drank or done some kind of drug. I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm simply saying almost every teen knows about these things. So censoring anything these days is almost pointless, but is for a good cause.       Almost every good book that has been written contains sexual content, violence, swearing, or alchohol and drugs. I think these things are interesting to read about. It kind of gets readers hooked. I can't remember a book that I've read that didn't contain any of these things that was good. There are very few books these days that don't contain swear words, sexual content, or drugs and alchohol. I think that most high school students are mature enough to handle this problem on their own, if they think the book is offensive they can turn it in and find a new one.     Today there are very few @CAPS3 rated movies that dont contain nudity, drug refrence, violence, or sexual conent, in fact there are very few @NUM1 movies that don't have these things in it. Once I was watching a movie with my mother, and three minutes into the movie there was already nudity. These movies are just becoming a part of our everyday lives. If parents want to keep their kids safe, they might want to watch the movie by themselves first to make sure they want their kids watching it.     The music these days is very different than the music our parents and grandparents listened to. There are tons of different genres and more than @CAPS2 of them refer to sex and drugs. Rap is becoming very big right now. And the lyrics mainly consist of swearing, sexual intercourse, using drugs, or alchohol. It's hard to find a song on the radio that isn't censored. There is an artist that is very popular right now, and about @PERCENT1 of his songs are about smoking weed. And it's hard to keep people from listening to music, becuase all someone needs is a computer and they can listen to anything they want.     These days its hard to censor things. There are some things I agree on censoring, but there are some things that people need to lay off on. These things are becoming part of our everyday lives. And it's hard to get used to and some people will never get used to it. The generations have changed, and will always keep changing.",4.0,4.0,7.0

What if their little kids want to watch a movie or something and they can't because all of the materials are gone. I think that the librarians should keep all the materials.    Maybe if all the libraries would all get together and pass out flyers to the people in the community; maybe the libraries would be saved. I think that the neighborhood would like to help the community keep the libraries the same as they've been for many years.   I don't know why parents are trying to take over the libraries the parents should have control what their children watch ,read ,the music, and books they read.I think the parents are really over reacting because children need books to learn how to read ,and listen to music if their bored.    All parents should pick their children movies,music,and magazines they look at and watch, and listen to",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"The first thought that comes to my mind when I think of censorship is control.  This is because that is exactly what it is, people are telling other people what they can and can't write about. If that book, newspaper or whatever it @MONTH1 be is not approved of it is then removed from shelves of public libraries, thus never giving us the chance to learn from it.     Recently I have had personal experience with censorship, in my sophmore english class we read 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'.   This book has attracted a lot of censorship over the years. That is becuase many people find the book very offensive.  I understand how people would find offense in the language used and the way certain people were treated in the book, though would the book be near as good if people talked more like we do today, when the book was set for the @DATE1?     I am not just saying that we should keep certian books just becuase the language in them makes them more interesting. These books give us prime knowledge as to how things were way back when, when there was slavery and there was a lot of offensive words said, but these words weren't so offensive then.  This day and age we know that people are to be treated equalling and with respect so we know to looks past these small meaningless words.     Now we all enjoy the child story '@CAPS3' right?  Well it appeared to me that not everyone did enjoy it.  As I was looking up facts about censorhip when I was doing an english project, I came across a website that showed some books that had been censored and I found '@CAPS3'.  I was dumbfounded at first becuase, what could be wrong with this amazing book(that soon became a movie)?  Well the reason it was censored is becuase in the story @PERSON1 runs off into the jungle with @CAPS3 and they weren't married. I know little children can be rather curious and I know that sometimes they see something and they want to do it, but I know that running off unmarried is not one of those things.      Children read books for the story, not to analyze everything about the book.  It lets them imagine and it opens their minds up to new and interesting things!      I have gained many new things from 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' one of them is that this book strengthened my want for everyone to be treated equally and fairly.  Books should not be censored if there is valid information in them that allows them to show how things are or were even if it is offensive.  After reading the children's book '@CAPS3' when I was young, I have found that even though @PERSON1 runs into the jungle with @CAPS3 I'm still here learning about the way a proper young women should behave and not off in some jungle somewhere living with a man I'm not married to.     When it comes to censorship things are censored way to hard, even though many things in books can be offensive doesn't automatically give the need to take the book off of the shelves of libraries.  People can not hide themselves and their families from everything that @MONTH1 have the potential to harm them,  they need to just grit their teeth and bear it.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"For some people, a local library can be where they spend most of their time. Everyone remembers going to the library as a child, and picking out your favorite book to read. The wide variety of different subjects or stories found in these books are practically endless. There is one question, however, that many people wonder about the library. Are some of the materials- such as books, magazines, movies- too offensive to some people? I believe the offensive material in libraries should not be removed, however, it should be isolated to one particular spot, so everyone can know which area contains the material.      There are many reasons I believe this. One reason is that I believe that some materials are not ment for children and some young adults to see. The least a library could do is keep one section for just the children, and another section for the potentially offensive materials. However, the responsiblity of keeping the children from wandering near the offensive material should be in the hands of the parent.      Another reason that the offensive materials should be one held in a particular section of the library, is that sometimes young adults, or even adults, can unknowingly pick up a book that contains offensive material. I'm sure that nearly all of us have been in a situation in which we started reading a book, and the story ended up to be something completely different from what we expected. If the offensive material is held in one section and contains a warning, this will not happen.     One reason I believe the material should not be completely removed from the library is illustrated in the shown quote by author Katherine Paterson. If a person could just remove a book from the library because they thought it was offensive, then more and more people would start doing this. Then, before we know it, there would be no more books left to check out.     All in all, I do not believe that the offensive material should be removed from the library. I do believe, however, that the offensive material should be kept in one section of the library, so that no one accidentally picks up a book/magazine that contains offensive material.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"'@CAPS1 me liberty or @CAPS1 me death!' were the exact words from a man who wanted freedom to express himself, then if he can have this freedom, why can't we? For the material that gets sent to libraries @CAPS2 of freedom to all students who choose to read it, for those who don't want to read it @CAPS2 up too them but, why take it away from all? On the other hand some can say that for the books and materials that are in the libraries does provoke those too read it becuase of the interest they have. As a teenager I can relate because when my parents or teachers tell me not to do something, your mind tells you different. For the books to be in the library @CAPS2 of great concern to some, but can be the smallest problem to others.     Censorship in libraries @CAPS2 getting of great concern to many parents, guardians, and teachers. They don't want the children of today to be drawn into books or materials that are negative in any way and @CAPS1 out the wrong message. These things should not be allowed into the public libraires, but be bought by those who choose to read it. When a parent sends little @PERSON1 off into school they want to be certain that he will be encouraged to learn positive things, not knowing that he will have the option of walking into the library and picking up a book that @CAPS2 negative in every way. In that situation parents want to be assured they have nothing to worry about, but in todays society, every child @CAPS2 at risk.     In my own opinion I believe censorship in libraries @CAPS2 wrong and does not @CAPS1 kids the ability to expand there knowledge on other things happening around them. For parents to be so concerned, that they are willing to fight censorship in school libraires @CAPS2 in my opinion disrespecting the freedom of speech itself. Those parents should have raised there kids right to where they don't want to be provoked or interested in negative writing. And for these things to not even skim there mind and keep on living there lives. These books, magazines, articles and etc. were all written by those who believed in the freedom of speech and wrote it for othes who have the same beliefs as they do.           These materials should not be of concern to anyone becuase you should have the mind set to know that it @CAPS2 wrong and to just leave it alone. And too let someone who does like it read and or listen to it. For those whose take offense to the materials I believe should not even care about it. It @CAPS2 there own choice to rather read or listen to it. And for them to listen or read it and say they don't like it but keep on doing it anyways @CAPS2 contradicting there own selves.      So for censorship on materials that enter libraires @CAPS2 forsure going to be an ongoing thing that many @MONTH1 try to battle, but in the end I know where I stand on this topic and so do many other people who strongly believe that it @CAPS2 wrong to keep such materials in the chool enviroment.

Most of everything in a book can happen in the real world and it's your choice to read it or not.          If you think a book is offensive in anyway, why pick it up? In most circumstances, the books that have any offensive language or pictures are set aside so people who enjoy those books can find them apart of every other book.           Certain things offend certain people. I'm a teenager and most of my age group like books and movies that are exciting. For an example, the @ORGANIZATION1 series are very popular to teenage kids. The books and movies have inappropriate language and other material that might @MONTH1 offend some people but it's how the person looks at it.     If you have kids and you don't want them to see movies or read books that are offensive, don't let them. It's your choice what you read or watch. They have it labeled on most movies or books that tells if the content is offensive at all.

In this esssay I will explain my position on the subject using my own experience, observations and through reading.     First, let me start with my own experience. When I was about five or six my family lived with a friend and the friend had a book that my mom considered to be offensive to me at a young age. I ignored my mother and read the book any way and come to find out she was right.     Second, I will talk about the observations I have made on the subject of offensive material. When I was in @CAPS1 grade in @CAPS2 class at @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the teacher, @PERSON2, was trying to think of a book to read to the class and I made a suggestion. She said that the book I suggested my be offensive to some of the other students. I was to young to understand what she meant so I asked, she explain as must as she can so that I could understand.     Third, I will talk about reading. I have read a lot of book in my days most of them do not talk about how things are offensive to others but some do. Though reading the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 series I learn that some spells are offensive to other students. The three unforgivable curse are used with @PERSON3 and his death eaters and are offensive to @PERSON1 and the rest of his friends at @ORGANIZATION1.     Now we come to the end of this essay. To recap I have talked about how materials can be offensive to other people.First I talked by how my own experience show me how things are offensive to other people. Then I talked about the observations I have made. Then finally I talked about the things I have read that showed me things can be offensive to other people.

I asked a librarian and she told me that someone is found offensive by love story books.      I think everyone has exactly rhe same right. In this case, I would like to say that the person had a right of choosing a book to removed which he or she found offensive. But if someone did that, some people would be dissapointing.

But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so dose everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' ---Katherine Paterson     @CAPS1 quote is true in many way. If everyone takes a book off the shelf that they dont agree with or that they might find affensive then there will not be any books left on the shelf, because everyone has there own beliefe or opinion on different subjects. I dont think everyone sholud have the right to take a book off the shelf just because they dont approve of it.      People know what they believe in or dont believe in. It should be there choice if they read that book or not. You can't controll what people like to read beacuse everyone has their own opinion. If people got to band books that they dont like then it would be a insainly boring place. What is @CAPS2 or even the @CAPS3 without stories. There would'nt be anything to talk about because there is nothing that you are going to get everyone to agree on. There will always be somebody that dose not like what you are doing or saying.     There is a more intelegent way to handle the situation of people not wanting there children to read some books. Leave that decision up to the parent or caregiver of the child. If you do not want your child to read a book then you as a parent have that right to say no to that certian book. It is the parents responsibility to teach there child the values and morals that you have.        Not all parents are responsibile thougth and some will let their child read whatever they want, but that is where the teracher comes in. The teacher should also have a say in what the child reads. Maybe not at home but at school the teacher should make sure that they are protecting the children form book that they do not need to read. Everychild is different so let the teacher make a disicion at school on what they think that the child is mature enough to read if the parent is not setting the example for them in the first place.      In the child point of view i know that i would not always want someone telling me what i can and can't read. It would feel like i had no freedom and that i was always being controlled. If everyone had the right to get rid of books that they did not approve then it seems like more children would want to read those books just because they were told not to.         If everyone takes even just one book of the shelf there will be no more books to read and @CAPS1 place will be boring and simple. I agree that not all books should be read by children but that dose not mean they are not good books and that they dont serve a purpose in what they are saying.

2,"In this passage I have just read about censorship is about how kids are getting offensive over books, movie, magazines,and music. I will write about how the kids could be getting offensive or up set with all the material (movies, books,and music). Also how the kids might be getting the materials . Maybe even how they are feeling after the material.     First of all, how the kids could be getting offensive of the material. The material might have raceism in it, or just really bad things that kids at that certain age should not be watching. Furthermore, the music that they might be listing to might have alot of bad words in it or even talk about bad things that kids at that certain age should not be learning. The books at the library could be the same way as music, and movies they all could be offensive to some people in different ways ,because the book might go into detail. All in all, evrybody get offensive over different thing and for this case parents are offensive over this because, they want to make sure that there kids won't go down the wrong path.     The second reason for censorship is how the kids might be getting the material ( music,movies,and books) that are unsutiable for their age. The kids might get the music from the internet ,and there parents dont know about it then they might walk around say those words that are bad for there age. For instence, when I was little my parents were the same way and my parents were right about it.The books at the library should be full of all kinds of thing that are not suited for kids, so I would talk to the librarian to make sure none of that stuff gets checked out of there. All in all, most kids are good at not going this, but i would make sure it won't happen for good.     The third reason how they kids might feel after they hear the music, or watch the movie, or read that sirtin book. The music when i was little was just like to same music now , but my parents would not let me listen to it because of all the bad language. The books might show them how bad of a person they might be if they act  like that. The movie might show them how a person that acts like that might in up in life. Most movies and music are not like that.       In conclusion, I wouldn't take censorship to far unless you know that you'r kids is going to act like that",3.0,3.0,4.0

I some what agree with Katherine Paterson when she said ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken of the shelf. But if I have the right to remove the book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone alse. Are school labrarie has no rules on what books we can check because the more we read the more we learn from them.     The book called @CAPS1 dosn't have any valger words in them, but it gives you a pucture in you mind of what happened to the people during the @CAPS5, and what they had to go throw to live. I belive that this book shouldn't be taken of the shelf, because it is part of history during world war @NUM1 and @NUM2. At first I din't like the book @CAPS1 but near the middle of it it got insuting all of a shuden and i did more and more recherch on it and did a project on it in speech class and I got a good grade on it.     There are other book I can't remember right now so in conclusion I would like to say, dont judges a book by the cover intel you have read the book.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship in libraries has been a heated topic to discuss among many people. There is the argument that it is alright for offensive books, movies, and music to be allowed in libraries, and the argument that anything that could be found offensive should not be tollerated. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, because if anyone could decide that a piece of material was offensive, there would be no material left on the shelves at all.      It is only fair to assume that parents want the best for their children, meaning protecting them from something before they think they are ready to handle it. Parents believe that it is wrong to expose their children to a mature subject, such as sexual activity or vulgur language at a young age. What parents need to realize, is that they can not protect their children forever. If parents prevent their children from learning material especially if the child finds the subject interesting, only creates suspense for the child, leading to rebelious behavior. Children, teenagers, and young adults are going to find out about mature subjects no matter what, so why not have them learn about the material in a library? If they learn about the material in a library, they are getting facts. Learning about mature material, especially material that can be found offensive, is better off being found in a library, rather than on the streets.     If censorship was to be allowed in libraries, it would eventually lead to a lack of any type of entertainment possible in libraries. Many people can think of some type of material that someone in the world could find offensive, but if that was to be able to be removed simply because of that reason, there would be nothing left for anyone to read. The people of @LOCATION1 will always be able to find some type of flaw in any topic in the world. People will always be able to find something controvercial in a material that a library posesses. If a libary contains material about history, there could easily be a discription of sexual activity in that book. Does that mean that if someone does not like the book, they can take away other peoples ability to learn about history?      The people of @LOCATION1 have rights. The library is a safe place where a citizen should be able to go and pick out material whether it be to read for pleasure, research for school, or learn many new things through the wonders of a book. The content that is held in libraries is not mean to offend someone. If a book, magazine, movie, or article in a library offends someone, they should not read it. It is common sense that if something is found unapropriate to someone, they simply walk away from it. Americans have the right to say yes and no, so they can say no to something they find offensive. Someone else can say yes, because they find the material enjoyable, helpful, or interesting.     There should be no such thing as censorship in any library in @LOCATION1. Censorship will only create more of a problem if people start to loose their rights, especially people who love to read. The best way to handle censorship in libraries, is to let the people of @LOCATION1 decide whether they want to read certain material or not. Libraries are safe, and nothing in a library is purpously meant to offend someone.  If a book is found offensive to a person, they should simply walk away and let it be read by someone who finds the book interesting. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed, because if anyone could decide that a piece of material was offensive, there would be nothing left on the shelves for people to read at all.",5.0,4.0,8.0

2,"Certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Some of these materials are not to be seen by younger children. They include violence, fornification, and drugs. Children are learning too much too fast from these materials.     Violence in books aren't as common in books compared to music. Young people are affected most by the music that's out today. Artists are always talking about who shot who and how they are going to catch who ever. If these materials are in our libraries then anybody of any age can easily check it out.      You read about fornification in alot of books now and days. Personally, I read my first book involving fornification at the age of @NUM1, which i checked out of a library. Younger children should not be able to just check out any book. These adult books should be taken out of the libraries and sold only in adult stores.     Alot of teens and adults are into the drug life. Many people listening to music and reading books about drugs would make them want to try it. In just about every song that you hear on the radio involves drugs. Alot of  the books in the libraries involve drug related topics.      In conclusion, certain materials that are in these books, magazines, and music are highly unappropriate to be on library shelves. In taking these materials off the shelves, there will be less of a chance of our children growing up too fast.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"People think that offensive things are about things that are about sex, or drugs, but not all things are about the topic they are about other things has well. People think those things shouldn't be seen by our children but if you think about it when you were a kid you would try anything to see what your parents were reading, or listening, or seening and must likely you did your children might have already seen what you seen your not sure but they might and takeing away something that will make you happy but others angry you think you are saving yourself and your children but your over protecting them they will find out sooner or later. Katherine Paterson says a quote that gets all of us thinking what we do to protect our children from hearing, seeing, or reading.     For some books there are such things in there that could be offensive to some people, but not all. Its not fair to take a book, music, movies, magazines away for one person that thinks one thing is offensive. When certain people find something in a book, or a lyric to a song, or a line in a movie, or an article in a magazine then they shouldn't read, listen, or watch them if they are going to be offend by it. Katherine Paterson talks about how some people have the right to take books off, they do, but when people think about it its not right to others, Katherine is right when she says 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people are offensive and argue to keep one book off the shelf others will follow and get more books off the shelf then we are left with nothing.     In my life there was a time at our high school library that some adults, and students where affend by this one book, it turn into a tertasafee that cause books to be remove from the library even magazines that metion one little thing about sex to cause the whole magiazine shelf to be taken down, one little article, and it was down. Some students were upset that there magazines were gone that one magazine cause the whole shelf to be taken down, you have the right to do anything you want and say freedom of speech, but people can't just think about themselves but about others and how this @MONTH1 affect others in someway.     Offensive is a little meaning word that can cause so much trouble in a school, or a town/city. I have read articles, seen movies, read books, listen to music that are offensive to me, but I'm not going to go to so much trouble for others to get a magazine taken off the market, and book taken off the shelf, a movie to not be shown in a theatre, or a song taken off itunes to download or make the artist take the song off there @CAPS1. Its unfair to others for me to be happy when I can just not listen, watch, or read anything thats offensive to me. To understand what other people have in their brains are chanlleging but in yours it's simple to understand you have to think what if this happen to you where they did what you were about to do, its unfair to you and you don't like it very much, but you fight for your book, magazine, favorite song, or movie to stay alive for others to injoy.     In conclusion, people have rights to do or say anything to get something of the shelf, but they don't have the brain to think about others and how it will affect them it's not offensive to others just to that one person and that is something that is are to handle but people have to think make one person happy, and millons angry, or one angry and millons happy, that is a question to you",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"There are many types of books that are offencive. The shelves of libraries are filled with them. My views of cencorship @MONTH1 be different from some peoples, but it is my opinion. What is considered offencive; religion, sex, occupations, certain topics, curse words?      No matter what an author writes about can be considered offensive. I believe that cencorship isn't possible in a library. They would have to take every single book off the shelves because every book is offencive to someone out there. Everyone wants to read the certain kind of books they like wether it be gory, emotional, meaningful, fictional, or whatever it @MONTH1 be. If the books were cencored it would be harder to find the books you like, the results of that would be less people coming to the library.     The only possible way it's even a little bit possible would be to have an adults section and kids section. Most libraries are already set up like this anyways. When a kid is looking for a book  they are most likely not going to look for chapter books with no pictures. When an adult looks for a book they probably are not going to pick up a picture book.     In conclusion, cencorship is not really possible unless there are kid and adult sections. Children will always have access to things they should not see, hear, or read. The cencorship begins with the parents of those children. What people choose to let their children see is up to them",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I dont think there will be offensive books, movies, or magazines on the shelfs of libraries or other family places but if there are I think they could be taken off the shelf and brought to the person in charge.

What would be the point of spending so much time and effort of getting all the bad stuff you don't like off the shelfs. It might be offensive but it might also be history.  So what if your child see's it, thats how they learn about it so they can stay away from it. So what if you dont want them asking you embarrasing questions, thats what parenthood is about.

2,"Almost everyone has a different opinion. I think we could almost agree on that. So, how do we decide what is wrong or right?     Huckleberry @PERSON1 is sometimes considered one of the best literary works ever written. So how is a book this influential removed from multiple schools and libraries across @LOCATION1? It is such an old book that much of the slang terms used when it was written are now offensive to many people.      Many magazines are fun to read and are not offensive. Educational magazines in libraries include @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or @ORGANIZATION1. Many magazines that seem harmless have advertisements for alcohol, or male enhancement. Most parents try to keep their children sheltered from these type of ads, but when children have access in a public library it is not an easy task.      I believe the best solution is the create a board of elected officials who make the decision. With that plan, more than just one opinion would be used. With multiple people on a board, it would be easier to make wise decisions. Another way to censor libraries that could be effective, is to have the librarian create a list of books that can only be rented with parental concent.      Since everyone has their own opinion it makes dicisions like this tough, but with creative plans and proactive parents, censorship in libraries is possible",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Many people @MONTH1 find certain topics, included in books and other publications, offensive. However, there should be no exclusion of a book because of an opinion of one person. Libraries should have the right to put out whatever publications they feel they public wants to have. A single opinion should not make a book disappear from a library. But, many opinions @MONTH1 be able to change that situation.     I believe that libraries should a sort of flagging system. In the flagging system, readers of that library can suggest that a certain publication is offensive to a group of people, and should be removed. The library should then total up the amount of flags a certain book has, and once it reaches a set number, then it can be removed from the library or set in a seperate section aside from the other materials. This kind of petition system can be very helpful to a library.     A library does not have the ability to know what everybody thinks is offensive. If a library removed every publication that one person thought was offensive; many people would not have anything to read because that is the genre that they enjoy reading about. However, if a book gets a large amount of suggestions that it should remove the book, it could become obvious to a library that it should consider the removal of that book. In my experiences I have noticed that one person can tend to ruin everything for everyone else. If a system was setup to make people provide a valid reason why they want this book to be removed from the shelves, then they @MONTH1 think over what they are doing. This @MONTH1 cause that person to realize they @MONTH1 ruin everyone else's chances at reading that book.     On the slip that a reader would hand into the library they would need a valid argument or reason against that specific publication. A valid reason would give the library a chance to realize what that book's flaws @MONTH1 be. If a library recieves many complaints about the same topic in the same book, they @MONTH1 need to go into a deeper investigation about what the book is really about. The population of the library would have to correspond with how many slips they would recieve before removing a certain publication. People @MONTH1 just end up ruining another person's chance at reading an excellent book, unless a library takes this topic seriously.     In conclusion, this topic cannot be taken lightly. Libraries need to take a serious look into why a book or other materials are found offensive, and if they are found offensive by many people. If a library notices a certain race of people are taking offense to a story the library @MONTH1 need to look into it more than if a certain age group is taking offense to another story. Overall, one person should not be allowed to have their opinion affect another person's chance at a great novel.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Dear @CAPS1,        In most states believing that certain books, music, and movies should be censored in librarys. The people should have the choice though on that should be in librarys, and what should not, cause freedom of speech. I do not want to have any foul language in books, in the music they have in each library, and movies they sell, they should be education not vulgare and degrating. I support the censorship and so should you.          In all of the librarys, you should see what you like the most action, horror, comedy, adeventure, etc., what you do not want to see is racist books, making fun of others, and books that contain excessive cussing. Books are about giving information out and keeping us entertained to read more, learing about history and outer space is my favoirte subject cause there are so many known facts, that just want me to learn more. Cursing in books are unnessary, it only gets your attention for a second, books like these should be thrown out of librarys, cause books are setting a bad exapmle for the young.          Music is a big part of society today, more and more artist are showing up in the world, I am a big supporter in all music, but I disaprove some music in the librarys.

The music you want to listen is your @CAPS2, and it should not be blaring so others around could hear. Music offered to you is educational and someone reading it to you.    Librarys, rarly contian movies that are bad to the public, movies in librarys should contain teaching the subject you want to laern and not something you see today in movie theathers. Moives today all are for adults, r-rated, half of them contain sexually, making fun of others, so why would you want to put those in a library for the younger population to see?     Censorship to some books, music, movies, etc., should be the peoples choice, if they feel that will educated everyone else.

Some people find it entertaining to read or watch these offensive materials because it @MONTH1 not be offensive to them.

2,"I think that censorship in libraries is a good thing. Censorship in libraries, in my opinion, is good because if the child is too young to know what the words mean, they should not even have the chance to be exposed to them. Depending on what age the person is they should not read, write, or listen to anything that should be censored.     I believe that any material that has to do with cursing should be censored. Books are a common thing that has cursing in it. Books that have curse words in them usually refer to any type of slang usage. Music on the other hand is a major item where censorship should be used. Most rap, rock, and hip-hop artists tend to curse or talk about sexual preferences while they are singing.     Movies are also a major item where censorship should be used. Cursing, major sexual preferences, and drug usage is where censorship should be used. Certain magazines also have a lot of things that should be censored. Such as things that have to do with curse words, nudity, and things that show drug usage.     I have had experiences with these types of things when I was young. I did not understand them and still do not know that much, but I should not have even seen those sort of things. The things that a child learns from these things is because the item is not censored.

I personally think that these types of books, music @CAPS1, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves.

The library made a section for people to buy, or check out the books that are @NUM1 years of age and older, people were happy about that becuase their business had come back after they rearanged things.

Therefore, I believe that all books and magazines should be checked for inappropriate materials in all schools. If they are not sutiable for our children then they shall be removed. This will help lead to a safer, appropriate environment for kids and staff of all ages.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Answering the question, 'whether or not libraries should be censored?',  can be tough. I personally believe that censoring libraries is unnecessary for a couple reasons. While some things can be offensive or unappropriate for small children, if they are taken off the shelf then no one can read them. Everyone has a different taste and a different outlook on certain books.     It is true that many things in certain books shouldn't be read about by children. But when children are that a certain age, parents need to monitor what their children are reading and listening to, untill they are mature enough to pick appropriate things that would be of their interest. Parents can tell children about books that they believe they will enjoy, or books with moral value that the child can use later in his life. But in the end, when the children are grown, they have the right to read what they want and develop there own opinion about the books they have read.    Besides, if we censored librararies to the point of letting people decide which books reamin on the shelf, then we @MONTH1 be denying many people some of their potenially favorite books. Like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work that I abhor- then you also have the same right and so does everybody else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone has a certain take on a book they read. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next.      People @MONTH1 find certain books offensive for many reasons such as politics, religion, relationships, or whatever. But people need to read many books in their life, and will figure out on their own, what they think is right to read. They @MONTH1 hate a book you love, and you @MONTH1 love one they hate. We don't have to believe everything we read, but it can be good to at least understand different authors views and understand why they wrote the book how they did. I personally have come across several books that I loved, but my family members disliked and had no interest in reading.      Reading is an opinionated hobby so there is always going to be that book you love or hate. But if you don't think it is right to read that book, then all you can do is voice your opinion to those who care. If you don't like it, then don't read it again, and share your opinion with your friends and family. There is no need to censor libraries and deny people books they love just because you dont share the same opinion. All parents can do is monitor what their children read. Now I can understand a section for explicit content, that only adults can use, but offensive material is not a cause for a book to be removed from the shelf.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines, internet, should be removed from the shelfs or to be removed form public if they are found offensive? My opinion is rather both answers yes and no.     I do believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and the internet should be removed because some people go in the library and use the computers because they need to, others go inand use it for either illegel matters or to look up items that shouldnt be looked up, expecially in public. Some books should also be kept out of reach of children, expecially the age they start to read because they might get ahold of a book that could scare them and it could change there life dramaticly. The movies, they dont bother me to much because there is no other way to get the movies if u dont ask because there usually in a drawer behind a counter were only a work member can get them out, its a great way because then no one can steal them. Magazines arent my most consern either because i highly bout that the library will carry inappropriate  magazines.     I dont believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and the internet should be removed because some people dont have a computer and would like to use one and when they get that chance, there going to do what they want. The books, people will want to read something totally opposite of what they read before so its great to have a large viraity of book and magazines. Movies are a great way for intertainment, for instense if someone didnt want to rent a book or magazine or they forgot there library card, they can just pay a rental fee for the movie.     My opinion is that if someone feels uncomfertable with some of the items in the library, at least put them in a different room so they wont be in with all the other books, i believe its the best thing to do for a neighborhood citizen.     Now you know my thoughts about the items in the library, i want to know your thoughts!",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Everybody has their own opinion. Whether or not someone thinks a certain material is offensive is completely based on what that person believes. As author Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 some material @MONTH1 be offensive to someone, it @MONTH1 be very useful information to someone else. No one should be aloud to remove materials off of a shelf in a public library.      Most importantly, people should not be able to remove material from a library because someone else @MONTH1 need that information for something important. For example if someone has to do a report on slavery and he or she goes to the library and discovers that someone found that book offensive and it was taken off of the shelf, that person does not have the information they needed. If someone finds a certain material offensive than that person should just leave it alone and not check it out. Everybody has their own opinion on what is offensive, but that should not affect what someone else has the right to view. People should not have the right to remove anything from a public library.     Another reason people should not have the right to remove media from a library shelf is because if everyone had the right to eliminate certain materials from a shelf than their @MONTH1 not be anything left to check out. Due to the multitude of opinions in this world and the amount of people their are, librarys @MONTH1 not have much media left after everyone takes out anything that offends them. For example if every six out of ten people took away one book from a library that contains one thousand books, every thousand people would remove six hundred books from that library. Sounds like alot right? It only gets worse from there. A public library is called a public library because it is their for the public to get information. If people are aloud to remove items from a library, how public is it then?People should not be aloud to remove anything from a public library even if they find it offensive.     Last but not least, people should not be able to take anything off of a shelf in a library because it is their choice whether or not they want to read it. @CAPS1 something @MONTH1 be offensive, it is the persons desicion to read the material or not. If a parent feels that something should be taken out of a library because he doesn't want his kid to read it than what that parent should do is warn their child that they do not want them exposed to that type of material. Another way a parent could prevent their child from being exposed to offensive media is to talk to the librarian about what his or her child has the right to check out. Taking something away from others just so it is not revealed to a certain person is ridiculous. Someone should not be able to decide whether or not someone else is aloud to view a certain media.      All together a public library is a public place to get information and should not be limited by others opinions. Someone should not be aloud to choose what another person views just because they personally do not like that material. @CAPS1 someone @MONTH1 find a material offensive, it should not affect everyone else who is interested in that material. People should not be aloud to remove any material from a shelf in a public library",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of out children or any other children have taken off of the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'                     Katherine Paterson                          @CAPS3 are many books,movies,magazines,movies, etc., on the shelves of our librarys and many @MONTH1 be offensive but lets get real, we've all heard these words before and many people use them. Why is @CAPS6 such a big deal when a book or what ever uses language that you hear everyday? If you don't like the language put the book down,turn off the movie,or press eject on the cd player! Get over @CAPS6!There are people who want to get rid of offensive language material in librarys, but if we do this how many books do you think we will have left on the shelves. If they are worried about their children getting ahold of the books then they need to go with their children to the library because i am positive that all libraries have a childrens book area. Now if the adults are worried about getting ahold of a strongly worded book then they need to grow up a little bit. Books are a very good way to explore the minds of others and to read what other people lives were like. Many authors didn't have a 'peachy cream' life and the way they write there books are the way they express them selves. An example of one of these books are 'A @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6' this young boy was always abused by his mother, she beat him starved him and alianated him from the out side world. He was locked in the house most of the time and while he was in that house many things went on. He had brothers but they never got a hand layed on them, they would actually watch in 'aw' of what was happening to theor brother. His father knew what was going on but did little to stop the horrific abuse. Now if this were you, and you wrote a book on what happend behind closed doors, would your language be preppy. No i don't think so!If you remove material from the library then I don't think that librarys wil have many visitors. There are many genras that people can choose from and I fully understand that some books are only for mature minded people, so don't read the book if you can handle the language and ideas of the author. Think of  how many movies there are playing in movie theaters that are rated @CAPS7.  Imagine if all rated @CAPS7 movies were no longer available to anyone. So no more scarry movies for you. You have to be a certain age to see these movies right, so I think that you should be a certain age before you can check out something from the library that is for a  mature minded individual.  Leave the librarys alone and focus on the more important things in life. Stop the violence, lower gas prices, stop polluting the air, lower the drop out rait, make schools a fun safe place for children, get more people to college, provide more jobs.

There is one extremely high contributing factor to the corrupt thoughts of our minds, nay, our entire world is what many of us spend intaking into our daily lives and activites. Many of these notions have taken root into how we express ourselves in society, whether it be through books, magazines, music, movies, @CAPS1, tapes, newspaper articles, and anything else the unsuspecting indiviual can pick up off the shelves. Any one of these foul fathomtations could cause such a catastrope that it could send one into addiction. Even burn our fair nation down into ruin bit by meticulous bit.",2.0,3.0,4.0
2,"In these days our librarys hold so much information. Do you think we have too much information in our librarys? Information like music, magazine, and movies are held in our librarys. Some @CAPS2 think that we have too much in our librarys, stuff they dont want there kids to see or to learn. The music is one, there is alot of music and alot of it kids listen to, but also there is alot out there that isn't appropriate for little kids to hear and should'nt be able to get this music. But right now kids can easily walk into public librarys and get this music. Also the posters of the music are up on the walls of the library and alot of them shows the artist smoking or wearing little to no cloths. They need to restrict the age limits and divide up the hallways to adult music down to kid music and take down inapropriate posters off the wall.The books are starting to get inapropriate for little kids two. From murder cases, to romantic love novels, or war books these genres are too old for little kids. So lets just take these out of the library and just have kids books. That fixes it doesn't it? Wrong, it doesn't fix the problem because @CAPS4 read too and the library is public for all ages so that isn't a way to fix the problem. So my theory is to divide the the library into three portions. Adult books, @CAPS1 books, and then kid books that way everyone can get the type of book they want without any trouble and @CAPS2 can bring there kids in and know that they wont see anything inapropriate.The movies have gotten more and more popular in librarys in these past years. Librarys now hold kid movies, war movies, romantic movies, and crime movies. But there isn't any regulations in librarys saying you cant rent this movie. So little kids can just come into the library and get a war movie or a crime movie anytime they want. They need to have them in seperations stating that you need @CAPS3 to get one of the more mature movies and mark them in colors from kids to teens to @CAPS4.So our librarys are a public place I think that we need all this information in our librarys but we need to just restrict the younger audience from seeing all of the library and the  information it holds. Divide it up and have it were the little kids can't see the posters and the music that they shouldn't hear and the movies they shouldn't see also the books theys shouldn't read. But its all there for  @CAPS4 to watch and read and listen to. This is a problem that we need to fix because public librarys are way to important to lose in @LOCATION1. The librarys need to stay for our education purposes. Those our my statements and thats what I think about this growing problem that we face here in @CAPS5 librarys.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censering Children is @CAPS1     @CAPS2 libraries in high schools have a '@CAPS3 Books @CAPS4' where books the school board @CAPS3 are aloud to be checked out. Most of these books are @CAPS3 because they are 'offensive' or have material not deemed fit for teenagers. Censorship in libraries is trying to protect those whom need to be exposed to such ideas. If adults beilve something is offensive or to radical for school-age children to experience, the children must be imediately shelterd from the idea. The duty of libraries is to open different ideas to the reader, if libraries censor those opportunities no one is benifited.     In writing a book there are many things to consider, like who is the audience, what time period does the book take place in, and how can the book come alive? The author's intention must be thought about. Why did the authour use this phrasing or style, to convey a point to the reader. In 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6', @CAPS7 @CAPS8 uses words common in the @DATE2's, but are not acceptable in the @DATE1. Banning the book would do more harm than good; students need to be exposed to what the past was like so the repition of history does not occur. Almost any ethnic group, race, or orginization can take offense to certian words used in literature. With a masterpiece like 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6,' the style @CAPS8 uses and the message should outshine the language. @CAPS2 schools have @CAPS3 'To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6', while others have it apart of the ciriculum. The story is part of our country's history and the oppression happened, so hidding it from the youth of @LOCATION1 will do nothing but let them stay ignorant of the world around them.      If libraries took books off the shelves for being the slightest bit offensive, the libraries would be bare. Censorship is good in modesty; for example, most fifth grade children should not read books intended for seniors in high school. If a book is about @LOCATION1's past, then the youth of @LOCATION1 should learn about it in a more real way than a textbook, and live the hardships through another child's eyes",4.0,4.0,7.0

If they are then who are we to say that they dont have the right to view or listen to that material. I will be covering more in this essay and i will give you my opinion.      Censorship is not the right way to go. Why hide some material from shelves if only some kids cant handle it but others can. Alot of children are ready for some of the materal we are censoring them from. we can not sheild children forever, they are going to have to learn about some of these things some day.     Who are we to determin whether the material is offensive. what we think is offensive might not be offensive to others. You can't take things off shelfs just for children not to read. You are just thining of one part of the people who do go to the library. Its not just children who go to the library. there are many people who go, so censoring shelves would turn them away from the library because the material is only for children      If libraries do want censore things then they should have two different sections, one for children material and the other just for adults material.There for if a child wants a book from the adults section then they have to have an adults there with them to check out the book. So in the end, its all up to the perent to determin whether or not they want there child to be reading or listining to the material they think is offensive or not.     So do i think censorship in librarys is right? No, but if they are going to do it, then they should do it in a better maner, you cant just take things off shelves just for one part of you consumers, you have to think about everybody. in the end its all up to the parent to determin if the material is right for there child or not.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"We've all seen a magazine with offensive material on the front, and we are allowed to do so thanks to the constitution allowing us a freedom of press. Different opinions and stories that can be told is what makes the @LOCATION1 so great, because we have that freedom. If we were to remove every item from the shelves it is taking away some beauty of our country, the education of our children and leaving us with very little material left.      People all of the country have different opinions on what is offensive and what they don't want their kids to see or read, some @MONTH1 think a book contains offensive material and another person @MONTH1 not. This @MONTH1 lead to having to remove a lot of different material that could in many cases be useful or even educational. This leaving us with very little items left on the shelf resembling having little freedoms as if we were governed by a dictator.      If libraries start removing things from the shelf more people @MONTH1 become offended. If a library claims to have removed every offensive material off their shelves and a person discovers something that they think is offensive this could just cause further complications. A librarian is not going to know the opinion of everyone that is going to walk through their door therefore making it very difficult for them to determine whether it is offensive or not.      There are many classic novels and textbooks that contain offensive or crude material due to the fact that times have changed. When books are written some things @MONTH1 be acceptable but then decades later times have changed and so has the culture. History is not something you can really remove from the shelves, bad things happened but we can't change the past. Hidding it from our kids is not going to help them learn and benefit in the long run. Sheltering kids from every bad thing will only hinder them when they try to go out into the real uncensored world we live in today.       Our country is a beautiful place with many rights and freedoms and removing certian books, magazines, movies, etc., it would be taking away from our country.

If nobody wanted to read that book in the first place they should'nt of picked it up off the shelf as well as even opening it to begin with. I beleive since we've seen and heard almost everything anyway that they shouldn't cover it up like it's new to us. Movies get better ratings when they show alttle nudity and cuss every once in awhile. Magzines are bought more when they say exactly word to word what the celebrities say out of their mouth. Music gets platnium records by thinking about what the people wanna hear.Books get read more by having drama and how people really talk to each other now-a-days. Us as humans @DATE1 like to get the real stuff when we open a book or magazine to read or to turn on our ipods to listen to a song. Most of the books, magazines, movies, and music relate to us in a deep way that we could really understand. They show the hard times and the happy times we've went through. If people dont like they way a book is told you should put it down and find another.If you dont like the way a song is sung switch the song or even better just listen to insrumenatl. If you dont like the way a moie is directed then watch a different movie.

We might think they are lying to us or trying to make us beleive it happend a different way. Kids, teens, and adults should watch whats appropiate for their age group. Thats why in the library they split it up into different sections. In the video store they usualy have the adult section blocked off so kids wont try and go back their.      In a books and music its a place where a writers and musicians can express their feeling and not cover them up. Us as human like to know details and you wont get much details if everything 'offensive' is covered up. You should get to know background information about the author, musician, or director and look at some of their past work to decide if you like them or not. If you don't like them dont read, listen, or watch anything made by them. If people find things offensive easily i'd advise you not to even take a step in the library nor walk into a music store or a theather.

The internet have alot of information, but everybody do not have access to the internet and some people @MONTH1 not know how to use the internet. The library whould be the second option if people didnt have internet.

Also reading can enhance your vocabulary. If yu read about things in the book you would probably find out more. The things that are in the books and magazines are there for a reason. People like to learn new things and they could learn them in the books and magazines in the library.

Not every parent finds it to be completly nesesary for their children to be resticted from questioning ideas and statment.

2,"I personally believe that no matter the content in some movies,music,movies etc that someone somewhere will always find it offensive sometimes more than others.We should'nt be able to just take away these things from people because we dont like, or agree with it.     It is not fair to some people to stop others from watching some shows, listening to violent movies, or even reading bad material.People have their own opinions and because others dont agree doesn't make it wrong.Everyone is an individual with the write to read,watch, and listen to what they want.Someones always going to be a critic and argue about these things, but as I said before thats just their opinion it shouldnt over rule anyone elses.     For example some movies and music show disgrace and blasphemy of certain religions, it should still be sold on shelves and available to the community.So if a preacher complains of it having bad teachings does it always have bad teachings maybe or maybe not, that is for the person watching or listening to decide.Everyone should be able to choose what they want and listen to what makes them happy or is their own personal style.Heavy metal and hard rock is what I like to listen to I enjoy the music and some of the lyrics,and someone else who is more of a classical or country music person they shouldnt be able to say I cant listen to what I love.     I agree with what @PERSON1 had said 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', because if everyone had that right the few critics of everything would eventually eliminate all we have because someone disagrees with its message.If a preacher disagrees and complains about a satanic message and books,the satanist has the same right to complain about the bible.I am a christian so I dont want people to be able to say i cant read the bible, and people of their religion can read what they see fits them.     If for someone reason they pass a law banning certain books, music, movies and other forms of entertainment who ever agreed to this should be banned from society, because their nothing more than a hypocritical individual who feels they have more say than everyone else.All these things are our own ways of seeing or expressing freedom, and freedom of speach nobody can take that away from us.Everthing should stay on shelves, and if the critics jump high enough they'll get over it and accept the fact their opinions aren't inferior to anyone elses.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I have been asked to write an essay to a newspaper about censorship in libraries. I am going to give you my take on the subject and then the take of other people. The big question is how bad could the book really be. The thing is some books aren't as bad as most people think. One of the biggest reason there might be a curse word in a book is because of the setting or the way of that person.     The questions is censorship a good idea or does it matter. There are very many ways to look at it. One of the ways is to think what kind of books would need censoring. I personly think that any thing sexually should never be on the shelfs of our childrens libraries. Now some of the books are ok in my eye. Let take 'To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2' it has a couple of choice words, but nothing series. It has some here and there just because of the time line it takes place in. Now I under stand about some religons, reading words that they don't normaly use, is different for them. It's not like they have never herd it before. I think that most parents wouldn't care about curse word in book, to an exstint. The people that do care seem to take it alittle to far sometimes. As in call the school to tell them what there son or daughter has read at school. The thing is that parents might have never read that book or even know what it's about. They just take it as another curse word.     Now there are many different types of books there are, present, past, and even future day setting in books. Where ever you are there will always be cursing. Not ever where you go someone will through out a curse word, but there out there. In my personal suspective a couple of words are ok but to much is just to much.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"You're community library is a place you go to reasearch, check out a movie, make copies, search the web, or start a new book. It is a public place shared with everyone. When someone tells you about a new book, movie, magazine, ect. you can't wait to check it out from the local library. You shouldn't have to have that feeling of disappointment when you realize it's not there. Books shouldn't be removed from their shelves because they seem offensive to others.      The guidelines for what's offensive and what's not is much too broad of a question to come to a right answer. What is offensive to one person might not be to the person next to them. Everyone has different views on different situations, so who gets to make that decision? It is considered speaking for everyone if someone says certain books, movies, magazines, ect. are offensive, when that @MONTH1 not be true.      No one needs someone else to speak for them because they are their own person and can make their own decisions. They can choose whether or not they check out anything from the library. I was at the grocery store one day and I saw these two men holding hands. There we're three teenage girls standing in the electronic department laughing and pointing at them. The two men noticed the girls, but didn't show it. They ignored them and continued on, because they knew that they're opinions couldn't change how they felt. If someone comes across something they find offensive, they should just return it to the shelf and contine finding something else that interests them. Having several books, movies, magazines ect. in the library doesnt mean you're forced to read, watch, or look at them all.      By not promoting certain books, movies, magazines, ect. in libraries many people lose money. Authors want their books in every store and library. If something about the content of their book keeps their work from being promoted, then they are losing money and publicity. Producers who make their movies available for people to watch, and then realize that's not happening because there is offensive content, they're losing money. If a magazine publishes a story that is full of opinons others don't usually agree on, they're content is now offensive and they're losing money. Many more people are affected by censoring in libraries than just those who don't want offensive books, movies, magazines, ect. in their view.      Libraries try to find books, movies, ect. that will please everyone for the most part. By keeping only certain things out they are forgetting about all the other people, therefore it doesn't please everyone. Haven't you ever went to a library and you couldn't find anything at all that sparked your interest? A better solution could be to keep everything in certain sections. If someone finds one of those sections to be inapproprate or offensive, they don't have to look at it. Instead they move on to another section that they seem to like a lot more, and everyone will be happy. This also makes libraries more useful to public, and more people would take advantage of it's resources.      We will all be exposed to things that seem offensive, there is no escaping it. You can't censor you're entire life. Books, movies, magazines, ect. shouldn't be kept out for that reason. If you don't find something offensive in a library, you'll find it walking down the street, or at your work. At some point in your life you have to learn how to deal with it instead of simply taking it off the shelf",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"There are many types of books, magazines, movies, etc. in a library. And all of them are made available to anyone and everyone. The idea of being able to remove something that shouldn't be read by your child, in my eyes doesn't mean you have the right to remove it.     In libraries everything is cut up into sections based on what type of reading your looking for. So if there is something that you dont want your child to be exposed to then you should restrict them from going in there. If the libraries removed everything that was vulgar or offensive to people, than they would have slim to nothing on the shelves.      Also what if the thing you complained about was removed, and somebody else needed it for lets say a project or work? And now they can't because you thought it was inappropriate. People shouldn't be allowed to determine what is on and off the shelves. When I was little there weren't things that I saw that I wasn't supposed to see. Libraries don't just stock there book cases up with inappropriate books and magazines. So people shouldn't be so worried about having there kids find something like that.     From this I think that libraries should not have to remove books that other people don't find appropriate. And instead of complaining about it, they should just not allow there kids and themselfs to read it",3.0,3.0,4.0

Carol believes her children are on their way to obtaining very successful lives, as they are on the honor roll and participate in numerous sports. When asked if she worries about the material her children @MONTH1 pick up at the community library she calmly stated, '@CAPS1 children have been taught to know right and wrong. When faced with a challenge I have enough faith in them to believe they will do what is right.'      The common beliefs of most parents are that everyone should be watching out for their children. As for protection in the library, multiple parents in local towns have signed a petition to ban offensive books and be rid of the potential threat forever.      What these parent are forgetting is that there are people of many ages that use the library as a source of entertainment. Contrary to common beliefs, I believe parents are sheltering their progeny from many of the moral tests in life. To symbolize this I will use a dog in training as an example, the owner must trust the dog has retained the training neccessary for the course. The parent needs not only believe in the child, but in their teaching as a parent, as the child grows the parent should be teaching right from wrong. Then when the time comes to let the dogs run free, parents know their child will behave.       As for solutions in the library, I have been in coutless libraries with age limits in sections. If the movie or book is categorized offensive, it shall be placed in the proper section. In the case that the library is too small to split into sections a parent should guide young children to the correct books and help them pick from an age appropriate selection",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Books Taken @CAPS1 of the Libraries!     I belive the book @CAPS2 should be @CAPS1 of the library. Because the book  uses foul language and it talks about sex, drugs, acohol. Kids shouldn't be reading those books. Really, aren't the school suppose to stop kids from doing drugs and partying??     The book @CAPS2 talks alot about sex. Aren't the school suppose to not have books about sex? I'm pretty sure they aren't suppose too. Even movies too. Kids don't need to read about them. The book talks about this girl(her name is @CAPS4) that likes this  boy named @CAPS5. and he  does drugs and likes sex alot. @CAPS4 hangs @CAPS1 with with @CAPS5. They hang @CAPS1 everyday after school and on the weekends.      So @CAPS5 asks @CAPS4 if she wanted to be @CAPS5's girlfriend? @CAPS4 had to think it about for a while then she finally said yes. They start holding hands and making @CAPS1. While they were in @CAPS5's truck. @CAPS5's asked @CAPS4 if she wants to cuddle underneath the blakent. So like everygirl would say, yes. She moved over there and while they are cuddling, @CAPS5 decides to move his hand inside @CAPS4 dress. @CAPS4 told him to stop. But he never did. He wanted to have sex in his truck and he wanted to have her.      @CAPS5 didn't like that all, he was mad like a lion taking his cubs. @CAPS5 forced @CAPS4 to have sex with him and she tried to tell him stop, no, she even started to scream, kick; pretty much anything she can do. So he decided to rape her. She was crying and everything. @CAPS5 didn't care, he knew excatly what he wanted and he got it.     In conlusion, kids like under @NUM1 shouldn't be reading this book.

2,"First off we live in a free country where people have rights.  So if someone wants to go ahead and read, watch, or listen to something that can be offensive to someone else then they have that right to do that.       I believe that the most offensive things in @CAPS1 world have been written in the past. Thats our countries history and if it is offensive so someone then they should just stay away from it.  If you really think about it how are we supposed to learn about our countries past time if all of the articles and book our taken down of shelves. To me @CAPS1 countries past is what makes @CAPS1 country who we are today. The way we came and took @CAPS1 land over and fought for what we wanted. Thats how @CAPS1 country gets it done if someone sitting on something we want we go ahead and take it from them.       I remember back when i was a little boy i was fascinated by old world war one books. I just love all the detail and the war stories the very fine veterans had put into words in a book. When you read an old book you realize how different the time was, how much harder life was and with out that, kids these days will have no known knowledge of that. I personaly think that is wrong. To shade our countries past time from them. Just imagine if that was you, you would have no knowledge of how @CAPS1 country started, who fought for it, all the heroes and all the presidents. could you imagine having to explain all of @CAPS1 to your children, because there not getting the proper education that they need in school.       'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken of the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have excactly the same right and so does everyone else. And the we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote is the perfect example because it speaks the truth and all we can ask for is the truth.  If we had the freedom to just go ahead and take books off the shelf then the people in need of those books cant have them because they didnt fit your lifestyle then all of those people have to suffer because of you.     I believe in freedom and if someone is going to keep me from my freedom then shame on that person.  Because i have the right to read, listen, watch, or act about something that i believe in.   So thats why i stand up for that freedom to learn and i will always be a strong believer in @CAPS1 subject.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I think that any book, music or movie belongs on the shelves at the library.Their are some main reasons on why I think that they should keep books, music and movies. Most of the things are knowledgeable, there are different ways that literature comes in to play and people learn better different ways.     Most of the things that are in the library are for people to learn sometimes entertain but most of the time libraries are used for a study source for people.Taking away material form the shelf that is found offensive is taking away from our knowledge. Some things in life are offensive buts it's apart of history that will better you in the future by knowing.     literature comes in to play in many different ways. Literature comes throughout books, movies, magazines and music so removing those thing from the shelf is taking away from us. Throught books you can feel and visualize whats happening, in movies can see and feel expressions, through music you can hear and feel the different expressions of something.     There are different types of ways that people learn. Some learn better throught books which means there good at visualizing thing's. Some people learn better throught movies which means they like to see what the situation is about close up. Music is also a form of some one that likes to visualize what the situation is they can actually feel the different tones and expressions of the music.      Through all of these things it starts with a book everything that has a book has a movie and everything that has a movie has a book so library should not try to seperate any of those form's of learning",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Some people @MONTH1 think that in our society today such books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored. People think that they should be removed if they are found to be offensive. Right away, the question comes to mind: how do we define 'offensive'? There are three good reasons that books, music, movies, and magazines should @CAPS1 be censored from our libraries. People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they wish; no books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed because each one has its own value in one way or another; and what is offensive to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly acceptable to another.     People have rights, including the right to read, watch, and listen to what they want to. If books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, people are having that right taken away. People should know what they are watching, reading, or listening to. For this reason, people should be able to be responsible enough to choose what they want to check out and leave everything else alone that they do @CAPS1 wish to read, watch, or listen to. Any person should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever he or she wants, regardless if it is found offensive, as this is a personal decision and responsibility. If these materials are removed from the library, this is taking away an important right for all people.     Everyone knows that books, music, movies, and magazines are very important and each one has its own value. Without books, people would struggle with learning, grasping new concepts, and growing intellectually. Books take people to new worlds, ignite images in their brains, and make the cogs between their ears turn as they think about what is on the pages in front of them. Books have an indescribable value no matter which book is picked up. For this reason, books should @CAPS1 be removed for being found offensive. Books that contain value to one person @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be valued by another person, but that person does @CAPS1 have the right to take that book off the shelf. As the quote by Katherine Paterson says '...But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work that I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We would @CAPS1 have any books left on the shelf if each person took away books that they thought were invaluable.       Lastly,  every person has an opinion of what is right or wrong, offensive or @CAPS1 offensive. If someone says that all offensive material should be removed from the shelves, how does one define 'offensive' in our world where opinions are so radically different from one person to the next? What one person finds offensive @MONTH1 be perfectly fine with another. What one religion @MONTH1 find offensive @MONTH1 be the central belief of a different religion. No one person has the authority to say what is offensive and what should @CAPS1 be appropriate for people. We have no absolutely possible method to define what is offensive or @CAPS1 because everyone's opinions are different, thus, there is no possible way to censor the material in libraries without offending people.     In conclusion, books, music, movies, and magazines should @CAPS1 be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. The facts that people have the rights to view, listen to, or watch anything that they wish; books, music, magazines, and movies have different value to different people; and that there is no way to define which books are offensive to people based on widely differing opinions all lead to the obvious conclusion that censorship should @CAPS1 be allowed in libraries and that no one should be able to take these materials off the shelf. It is one's own responsibility to check out what he or she wishes and to leave alone everything that he or she finds offensive.",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Have you ever read a book or magazine or even listened to a @CAPS1.D that was non cencored? I think we all have, its just apart of nature, thats all there coming out with now.     Everybody nowadays is listening to non cencored @CAPS1.D's or watching non cencored movies, I don't think anybody in the @LOCATION1 don't listen or watch movies or even read magazines that are cencored, everything is going to non cencored. If it were really up to me, I wouldn't mind having everything uncencored only because its happening now.      I really don't think that things should be pulled off the shelf in libraries because its not cencored, I think that if they did pull everything non cencored item off the shelf nobody would go to the libraries anymore because they want to read, listen, or watch what they want, they don't want other people telling them what they can watch, read, or even what to listen too. I also think that if they made it a law that the libraries shouldn't put that stuff up on the shelves, that our @CAPS3 will try to fight it to make it not a law.     The kind of music I listen too it's not cencored at all, and I know alot of people that listen to the same music I do, and theres nothing wrong with it. Now I also know alot of people that listen to @CAPS3 and theres nothing wrong with @CAPS3 either, I listen to both. I think every movie out there is not cencored, they all cuss or have bad things in it that children shouln't hear or watch, but if you don't want them listening to it or watching it, then don't watch it while there in the room, wait until they go to bed or they are out side playing, but sooner or later they are going to experience listening to music thats not cencored or watching movies thats not cencored, or even reading books or magazines thats not cencored.     Our @CAPS3 has changed alot back in the @DATE1's or maybe even the @DATE2's everything was cencored and then once we hit the @NUM1 @CAPS5 and when they came out with @CAPS6&@CAPS7 or even @CAPS8-@CAPS9 everything went to being non cencored because the '@CAPS10' wanted to show a point that everything could still be the same with there songs having a few bad words in there and them trying to make a point.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"There are many materials in a library, and it is the choice of the individual person if they will read, listen to, or watch these materials. However, most every book will be found offensive to an individual person because of their beliefs and ideas, and if every offensive material were taken off the shelf there would be no more materials in the library, so it is up to the individual person to decide what to read.      People have different ideas of offensive material. A @CAPS1 might find @CAPS2 books in the library offensive, and a @CAPS2 @MONTH1 find @CAPS1 texts in the library offensive. Yet neither of these materials are in and of themselves bad. The individual person might not like them, so they should decide not to read, listen to, or watch the materials. People also have different ideas of good reading material.     The genres of books are wide spread and very diverse. Science fiction to autobiography are all available in the library. An individual @MONTH1 find a vampire book offensive because of their idea that vampires are evil; and another might enjoy these books because they like to use their imagination. In my own experience, vampire and fantasy books are not offensive, because people know that they are fiction, as are all the creatures in them. These kinds of books are purely for imagination. If a person finds them offensive then they should not read them. It is up to the integrity of people if they should read material or not. If an individual finds a material and in the middle of reading, listening to, or watching it, then it is up to them to choose not to read it. Other people @MONTH1 not find it offensive. These are situations that you can not please everyone in. The individual has to decide what is best.     It is not the decision of the people that a book should not be in a library because it is offensive. However, in my observation, if the cover of the material is inappropriate then the jacket should be covered or changed, because of little children that @MONTH1 see it. Yet they should remain on the shelves as long as they are not adult material. It is also up to the parents to monitor what their children and teens are reading.     Therefore, material should not be removed from library shelves because it is found offensive. If an individual finds a material offensive then they should avoid it, but taking the material from other people is not right. As long as the covers are appropriate for children, who wander by, to see, they should remain on the shelf. It is the individuals choice to read or not to read, not someone elses decision to take it off the shelf",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I believe noone should really have the right to take any books, music, movies, magazines etc. off the shelfs.

Everyone has different likes and dislikes, maybe one person @MONTH1 not like one book but another person does. Or maybe perhaps one person might like this certain type of music and one might not. You shouldn't just take things off the shelf because there is one that @MONTH1 not like one thing or @MONTH1 diagree with something that is in the book or music or anything. It's called difference.      Also there is culture. There is also beliefs. Many people are different and like different things. A person @MONTH1 find something offensive but if they do maybe they should just find something else and put back whatever that they might find offensive or wrong. The point i am trying to get at is that all people are different we all don't like the same things or dislike the same things. We all find different things interesting or not so interseting or wrong, and even right, maybe great or not so great as well.      We are all different. Don't mean to repeat the same things over and over again but its true we are all different. It is a true fact. I dont know, some people @MONTH1 disagree with my outlook on things about books, music, movies, magazines ect. being removed from shelves. Although, just because one person @MONTH1 think there's something in the book, magazine, newspaper, movie, or music, that @MONTH1 be wrong and shouldn't be in there.       I will agree, that I have disagreed on some things that I have seen myself in movies or read in books and magazines. But that doesn't give me the right to just stop it and keep it from being out there for everyone else that @MONTH1 like it or enjoy it. Therefore everyone has there differences. Kind of like debating on things. Some will agree with this and some @MONTH1 not. We all are able to have our own oppinions on things around us.      All people see things different or @MONTH1 even take things different. Just keep in mind that it is best to keep your thoughts to yourself.

Im not talking about just things of that nature that are not appropriate for children to be veiwing, but I am also talking about certain beleifs and oponions that are shared in books and in movies. More specificly speaking, books that exprees its ideas about evolution. Those types of books and movies can put the wrong idea into peoples minds.     I remember one time when I went to the library to get a book about dinosours, and that book ended up being about evolution. I took that straight back to the library because I did'nt want anythin to do with it. After I found out that libraries had books and movies and magazines on the topic of evolution, I took a oath to do my very best to rid the them of all the awful content about evolution.     I just really feel a sense of saddness in my haert when I see young people go into libraries and be around all the harmfull knowledge of evolution talk.

Books grant us with knoledge, and excitment. What one person @MONTH1 love another would hate. If all the books that people thought were offensive, were taken off the shelves, we would have no books left.

Should people be able to take books off the shelves if they find them offensive? The answer is no, because without books we couldn't have formed the world we live in today.

2,"Hello, my name is @PERSON1 and im a student at @ORGANIZATION1. I think that books should be aloud to have what ever they want in them because everybody has their own openion and their own perspective on things. If kids cant learn about these things in school where they are tought not to do these bad things, then where can they learn them? I say more than likley on the streets, and if kids are learning on the streets then they are more than likely doing it because their isnt an adult figure their to make them understand that its bad and other kids are going to try to influce them.      I think music should be cencored in school because a lot of kids parents dont let them listen to cuss  in music, but if they can get it at school then whats the difference? Music doesent have a ratings like movies to tell you what the content is so kids will just listen to what ever they want and parents dont do a lot about it because they dont know what the music has in it. Take my mom for examle, she listens to country and she hates rap, but i listen to rap. She lets me listen to it because she has never listened to anything i like so therefor she doesent have a clue what profanity is in it and therefor she doesent stop me from listening to it.      My openion on movies would have to be to cencor them but to an extent. If its for educational purposes then i dont think it should be cencored, but if its just a movie day and somebody wants to bring in a movie with profanity and nudity, i dont thank that should be aloud because some people take it to far and also some kids parent dont want them learning about those things just yet.      Magazines are about the same as movies and music, it should be cencored, because if not kids would bring things like porn and other non-appropriate magazines to school and would be showing other kids.

2,"Ban books, a topic many schools and libraries contimplate and debate about.  Why would you ban books in the first place though?  What can words on a page do to change your mind about something if it is that important to you?  Reading books is a choice, and it is your choice what you do with the knowlege you gain after you close its pages.      Some books are not suited for young readers and I agree with that I do.  However it is also a choice parents should keep monitor over.  It is not the school or libraries responsibility to look over what your child reads.  You don't have to ban books to keep them out of reach of little hands.  The library has a childrens section, and at elementary schools they don't have inaproprit books kids can get ahold of.  But it is still your right as a parent if you don't feel a book is fit for your child you can always make the decision for them not to read it.     I disagree with the decision of any book being ban.  Especially at high schools, by the time you reach this age you should be able to be mature about the materials you check out.  I don't believe any book could be so bad as to say no one should ever read this book.  In high school you  usually have very little free time anyway, I feel if you want to spend that time reading it should be able to be any book you like.  Why should adults who are not your parents get to decide what you fill your mind with anyway?  Granted not all parents monitor their children's reading choices to carefully but again that is a  reflection on them as a parent not the school's or librarie's.       When your a kid the one thing you want to do when your parents tell you not to so something is do it as many times as you can without getting caught.  If a book is so bad your school even says no you cannot read this book kids are going to want to read it.  They're going to be curious that's human nature.  If you give kids the freedom to choose their books maybe there would be more knowlage gained, but if your putting a restriction on it it just makes everything more difficult.  When you have to read certain books if your not interested in them how are you going to stick with it?  Well your probably not, and if those are the only books your able to check out then your ambition for reading is not going to stay for very long.  You could be missing out on some great books and not even realize you enjoy reading because you were never given a chance to read a really great book.     I am not saying the book all about sex and drugs and violence when your eight years old.  But simple books such as @LOCATION1's @CAPS1, that book is ban because some parent in  @LOCATION2 said she didn't want her child to read it because there are talking animals in it.  When I was a kid I thought animals talked anyway thats not a big deal ,but for some other schools she got this story ban.  Also the classic @ORGANIZATION1 is ban this one because it has a pig in it and  they say it is ofensive to @CAPS2.  If that one mom would of just told her kid no you cannot read this book other children wouldn't have to miss out on the chances to read such great and inspiring stories such as these.       I have mentioned many thoughts on this topic.  No I don't feel books should be removed from any shelf inless you are pulling them down to dust them off and share the contents with a friend.  No book could be that offensive, if you find it offensive all you have to do is place it back on the shelf and go  on with your day.

When a child is in a library they want to look around and explore, but when the libraries have subjects on drugs, alcohol, teen pregnacy and abortion they are fueling the curiousity of a young childs mind. With the way the media and authors of books are these days you see more vercitile writing than in previous years. People are more open to talking about sex, drugs and teen pregnancy because its an every day occurance to many.      When a elementary or high school student goes into a library and can pick up a book about drugs, alcohol, teen pregnancy and sex that is very inappropreate. I have walked into my own library at my school and have read books about drugs, sex, gay marriage  and many other disterbing topics. Also at my school middle schoolers, twelve and thirteen year olds, can pick up these same books. Books like these should not be sitting on the shelf for young high school students to read. It seems like the young gergeneration are learning more and more at a younger age, things children should not know. It is wrong that a high school library can help that out and provide books on these offensive topics.      The books at our library are filled with things that some kids @MONTH1 find offensive or to much to hear, but what about the parents? The parents of the children should be asking the school board or librarians what they are allowing their child to pick up and read on a day to day basis. Parents should be going to their local library to see for themselves what their children have all day access to, if they knew they wouldn't like it. Parents need to make sure that their childs school is safe. Having material like gay marriage, teenage sex, drugs, alcohol and other things is not safe for the child. It is introducing them to topics they should not find out about until they are much older. Some topics that are talked about in gossip magazienes and books have very strong opinions, that means someone elses opinion on these sensitive topics are being brought to your childs attention. Parents should be able to trust their local library to keep your child safe and away from these topics, but now parents have to worry what their child picks up from the library. The libraries should not limit the kids on what they don't have access to, but what they do have access to.      Movies in the library are also very contrevercial. I have looked at some movies in the library and wondered if that should really be on the shelf. There are movies that have drugs, alcohol use, sexual scenes, and gay material. The movies also have the ratings such as @CAPS1, @NUM1, or @CAPS2, but in the library a middle schooler can pick out a movie no matter what the rating is and take it home. The parent would have no idea what their child is watching. Parents should be able to trust the librarians to follow the ratings and to be smart. Another thing a child has access to in the library is magazienes. Magazienes are a good sorce of news, current events, politics and much more. Some magazienes are good but some are gossip magazienes that have very high views on certain topics.  I have a subscription to the magaziene @CAPS3. This magaziene has many topics that I would never want to show my little sister. The magaziene has gossip articles, current event artices, then the 'sensitive' aritcles about things like gang rapes, drug abbuse, alcohol addiction, bullying, sex, and @ORGANIZATION1's. These are not things that young girls, or boys should have access to. Libraries have these types of magazienes on the shelf and they allow anyone who wants to check them out to do that.      Our childrens libraries should be a safe learning enviroment, but they shouldn't be learning about certian topics. Library censorship should be taken in to account, the kid affected are our nations future. This is a very serious issue that could be happening in the best schools in the best places. The kids being affected by this could be your own. Are you going to change it",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Hi, yes  im  writing  a  paper  to  the  public  libraries.  I  do  believe  that  cartain  materials  should  be  removed  from  the shelves  if  there  are  found  offensive.  I  won't  to  support  my answer  by  saying  this  some  people  might  think  that  its offensive  on  what  getting  took  of  the  shelves.  But  others dont  think  so  the  libraries  is  hat  you  wont  to  take  of  off and look at if you dont like it put back somebody else might wont  to  look  at  that  book  or  movie  etc.  Now  on  that other  hand  people  wont  to  look  at  the  book  or  movies  etc can  do  so  they  might  be  writing  a  paper  they  can  go  find the  book  and  it  would  be  there.     For  an  example  when  I  wont  to  go  to  the  librarie  I  go look  up  a  book  that  I  wont  to  read  or  an  magazin,  movie I  won't  to  watch.  I  dont  think  the  stuff  they  have  in  the libraries  are  not  offensive.  Somebody  might  wont  to  write  a  story  base  on  the  movie  that  they  have  or  a  book.  If they  take  it  off  the  shelves  that  person  can't  do  no  resacrh  on  that  topic  they  won't  to  do.  Some  people  go  to libraries  just  to  find  music  and  if  they  take  that  off  the shelves  they  not  coming  back.     For  some  movies  that  have  bad  stuff  you  should  be over  the  age  @NUM1.  Know  one  under  that  age  should  be able  to  watch  it  or  check  it  out. Books  should  be  for everybody  I  don't  think  some  books  have  anything  bad  in  it  maybe  a  few  cuss  words  that's  it  and  thanks  for  taking  the  time  to  read  this  I  hope  you  understand  what  im  talking  about",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"If someone or something told you their opinion about you would you get offended or would you just act like it never happen? Katherine Paterson an author has a quote that states: 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     I strongly disagree with having censorship in libraries because as said in the quote stated above to my understanding: If everyone could take a book or some kind of material off the self of the library that they didn't want their child reading or just because they didnt like what consisted of. There would be no books left.     If I were a parent and I didn't want my children reading things that I knew were going to make them upset or effect them. I would most deffinetly not let them even get close to the material in the first place. I would be right by their side untill they got old enough to make their own desicions so that nothing would ever happen to them.     Say I went to the library and I found a magazine that was over losing weight. While looking at that article I noticed that there was a body mass index chart to the left in the margin. I start looking at it and figuring out my b.m.i. and its basically saying I was over weight. @CAPS1 not going to go sit down and cry about it and say this magazine I looked out told me I was over weight so @CAPS1 not going to eat anymore and throw it away. I would just be like thats not true at all and I think that things like this would most deffinetly not happen if I had someone right by my side telling me thats not true.     What I have found out as a teen over the years is that everything you hear, say, or read is not always true and you should not take it to heart. You know who you are and what your all about, so dont let anyone or anything tell you different. After that day I started to make sure I either avoided situations like that or had someone with me.      My advice to one that reads this is just dont let it get to you be careful with what you look at and if your young and are at the library have a adult with you so nothing ever will happen to you like it did to me.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Books enable the mind to go to work and allows the readers to use their imagination. But if books are taken away from these readers, how, then, can their minds be stretched and molded? How can they be introduced to new ideas and look beyond what is fact or fiction? The censorship of books denies the complete freedom of readers of all ages and prevents them from expanding and broadening their minds to new subjects and ideas. Literature is about expessing yourself and the censorship of books does not allow authors or readers to have that freedom.          As young children we read stories that have nice, happy endings and they always seem to have a moral to it. The world seems to be safe and life is easy. But as we begin to grow up, the challenges of life also grow and our choice of books and other reading material begin to expand. It is all a part of growing up. The books of our youth allowed us to use our imagination and the books of our later years allowed us to learn about and cope with reality. If our books were removed because they were found offensive, then how would we be able to see reality as reality? Censored reading materials prevent the world from learning about new things. You wouldn't take away health books in a health class because it goes into explicit detail about the facts of life. It is the right and choice of readers to learn about these things, not anyone elses. If a book is too offensivefor them, then they can choose to stop reading it. One book @MONTH1 not be the right book for one person, but it @MONTH1 be the right one for another person.          How does a person or group decide which books to take off the shelves? How can one book be more explicit than another? My sister is a fourth grader and she is reading the book '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 the past few days she has become very angry at the fact that they author uses explicit words. '@CAPS3 does the author use cuss words?' she asked me one day. '@CAPS4't he know that fourth graders are reading this?' I remember thinking the same way she did when I was her age, but then I realized that, as I grew up, the words that were said were only a part of life and will always be. If this book was taken off the shelf for fourth graders, then what books should be taken off for teenagers my age. I read 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' a few months ago and the choice of words in this short novel was not very pleasent. I do admit I was a bit put off by many of these words, but it was a part of history. It is how they talked and acted back them. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6' is a classic and the thought of taking it off the shelves would cause much contreversy. But if this book isn't censored, @CAPS3 are others? All books teach a valuable lesson whether it is wrong or right. 'Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6', no matter how much I disliked the language that was used, put me into that time in history and I was able to understand the feelings and the events of this book much better than if these words wouldn't have been used.      Literature is about expressing and freeing yourself. Literature gives you freedom, and choices. You have the choice to read fairytale stories to escape reality or you can read a @ORGANIZATION1 magazine if facts and nature interests you. Censoring books takes away some of this freedom for readers. Do you remember the little childrens toy that had a box with holes and you had blocks that were shaped to fit the holes? As a child, you learn which shape goes with which hole and as you grow even older, you learn what shapes these blocks and holes are. Well, taking away certain books is like taking away one of those blocks away from a child. If the child is not given that shape, it is not given the opportunity to learn that that shape goes in its designated hole. If a reader is not given the freedom of choice, then they will miss the opportunities to broaden their minds and learn about new ideas. How can a reader know if they like a certain genre of book, if only but one genre is presented to them?     Censoring books prevents readers from expanding their knowledge and they lose the ability to express themselves in a certain way. Censorship of books could start a process like that of a domino effect. If one book can be censored for one thing, then other books could fall into that same category. If there are no books left, then how can a person learn",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"In today's society, many things that were once considered inappropriate are now commonplace.  This, however, does not mean that some material is meant for or okay for children to see.  There are many books, magazines, and movies in libraries that are inappropriate for children to be observing.  Libraries should establish a common system and common boundaries on what should be censored for the sake of the children that are in attendence at the library.  Since most parents have a similar opinion on what is considered right and wrong for children to observe, coming up with common rules should not be a very hard task.     With today's declining concept of what is appropriate and what is not, @CAPS3 is hard to protect children from early exposure to inappropriate things.  However, some measures can be taken to help keep children's minds as innocent as possible.  One of the possible ideas to help this situation is by censoring some of the literary works in libraries.  Since many parents and adults agree on what is appropriate for children, coming up with a system of rules on censorship should not be as difficult as @CAPS3 @MONTH1 seem.  For example, there could be a room with books that contain adult material located separately from where children are aloud.  This could solve this issue by not exposing children to the media in the room where the adult content books were located, but the adult books could still be there for people of the appropriate age to enjoy.     Most parents in today's society have a common view and opinion on what is appropriate for their @CAPS1 to be exposed to.  Most parents do not want their @CAPS1 viewing books, movies, or magazines that contain sexual material or vulgar language.  Adding censorship to some of the material in libraries could keep children from viewing this type of media as much as they would if there were not censorship laws.  However since there are some parents' opinions that do not coincide with the opinions of other parents, the board members of the library or the librarians themselves should decide on a commom set of rules and regulations on what is appropriate and what is not.  In the extreme case, states could create and establish their own laws about this issue.     As a @CAPS1, I brought home the book 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3', in  fourth grade, and was shocked to find that there was very vulgar language at a couple points in the story.  After my mom discovered what i was reading and the material in @CAPS3, she took @CAPS3 to the school library and showed them what I had found.  The librarians apologized numerous times, and had a restriction established that only sixth grade and up could read the book.  This is one example of a form of censorship in our school library.     Although many people would say that censoring books and other media from libraries is essential, others disagree with this.  Some people would go on to say that everyone has different opinions on what is right and what is wrong.  As the author of this article states, she feels that if people were to censor books and other media based on their own opinion of what is right and what is wrong, in the end, there would not be any books left on the shelves.  With every person and parent having their own unique opinion, the author feels that all books would be eliminated if libraries were to censor media based on each individual opinion.     While there are two sides to this arguement, I believe that libraries should censor their media to a certain extent.  The state should establish a set of censorship laws that abide to all libraries in that specific state.  This would eliviate some of the pressure off of the librarians to try and please all of the people in attendance.  This way, children could be exempt from media that the state law says is inappropriate.  Children's minds could remain as innocent as possible, and they could remain unexposed to material too adult-friendly for their age.",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 is offensive to you? Bad language, religious views, parenting advise, certain styles of clothing? @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to some people might not be offensive to others. Just because one person thinks something is offensive, should take it off the shelf?     I do not believe that certain reading materials, movies or music should be removed from libraries, book stores or anywhere else just because some people think that something  is 'offensive' about a book, magazine, music or movie. A christian might read the bible and enjoy reading the bible, an athiest might pick up the bible to read it and think it is offensive to them because of the different religious views. Instead of removing the bible from the library, why not put it in a special section called religion and in the religion section have the different religion books. The bible would go under christian. That way a person who is not a christian will not pick it up, read it and find it offensive and try to get it out of the library or book store.     A lot of parents do not want their child listening to music, watching movies and reading books with foul language in it. Some parents do not mind the language and let their children listen to music, read books or watch movies with bad language in it. It all depends on the parent. It is not just kids that are not listening to foul language, it is adults as well. A lot of adults do not mind it when something has not so good language and some even use that language themselves. Would it be fair to take out items with foul language? No. Marking the books, music or movies would be a better idea, that way if an adult who is against foul language can see that there is bad language and they do not have to find out the hard way or have their kids read it. Movies that have language that @MONTH1 be offensive have a warning before the movie even starts, so it is not a suprise to people who do not like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1, I hear every bad word in the book all day for the seven hours I am there. Should the schools take out the students who use that kind of language, no, there would be hardly any students left in the @ORGANIZATION1. So think about it, should libraries do the same about reading materials, music and movies?      @CAPS1 even makes a book 'offensive'? Do you decide that, your neighbor, your close relative, the author of the book? Are we all the same? No, not even identical twins are the same or think the same. Now days it seems that everything is offensive. Because we are not the same as everybody else, we can not speak for everyone else by saying that some reading material is offensive. People need to realize that they can not get away from everything that is bad in this world. Should one religious book be terminated from a library just because someone else in the whole world does not believe the same way? Should a movie be taken out of the theater because it has foul language in it? @CAPS1 do you think? I think that if something is offensive to me, I will not read it, listen to it, or watch it. Why take it out, other generations could be missing out on a really good book. The other generations could be missing out on some inspiring music, or a touching movie. Has the saying 'never judge a book by its cover' crossed your mind, well the same could go for the inside of the book as well. So if a book, magazine, movie or music is offensive to you, do not buy it, listen to it, watch it, or read it. It is just that simple. Remember @CAPS1 might be offensive to you, might not be offensive to others",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Writing, music, and production. All three of those are a form of a certain art. Litterary art, musical art, and visual art. People make artwork for the world to see and hear. And when people begin to complain about the content of a certain artwork, it is censored.     I do not agree with removing books, movies, music, magazines, nor anything else from shelves if someone finds them offensive. Someone took the time out of their life and put together what they believed was a well thought out idea and created it. How did they get that book, movie, music, or magazine on a shelf? Someone else thought their idea of whatever kind of artwork is it was a good idea, meaning more than just them enjoy it.     I, myself, am a music artist. I write music and play it with my band. Alot of time, hard work, and all around dedication is taken to achieve but @NUM1 song fully written. So say my band and I take the time to put together an album of our music. That music would be sent in to a recod label. Now lets say the record label signs us. That label would find places to put that music on the shelves of certain stores so that a consumer could purchase that music. Ultimately, it is the consumer who judges what artwork they obtain.     What if the consumer was offended by the music the record label put out? Well here @MONTH1 be a better point. If the consumer was offended by the content of that art work, why did they purchase it? It isn't their right to buy artwork they are offended by just to complain about it to try and have it removed. This situation can be easily avoided if that consumer avoided that artwork.      Why should only a few people who complain have the time and hard work of others censored by the media? It's just not fair to the artist! Alot of dedication and time is in the creation process of their work. And for someone to obtain it, complain about it, and ultimately try to have it removed it just wrong and ridiculously unjust. There is NO excuse for why people do that. The easiest wasy to keep from being offended is staying clear of that which you do not like/ offends you.",3.0,3.0,4.0

2,"Removed from the Shelf?          I believe certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Childern, teens, and adults all perfer different books, movies, and music. Artist, and writers should be aloud to proclam what is on their mind and what needs for get acrossed to other people. Libaries, and all stores should not remove these artist and writers feelings and thoughts from the shelves because one person thinks it is offensive.           As a child, they perfer the books with many pictures, and fun filled characters. It is not likely for a child to pick up a book that is not right for them to be looking at. All child do not understand what is bad and wrong for them. They just want to look at pictures and have their imagination go wild. Child also are not likely to sit down and watch a rated or bad movie. The child to going to pick out a @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 family, or other fun enjoyable movie.     As a teen, I understand boys and girls start to understand what is out there in the world and want to know what some things are. But, shouldn't that be allowed having the teen be aware what there is be learned. Yes, I agree some things should be kept away from teens. As a teen they should not go out and try things, or get in trouble from adults and their own parents for wrong choices because of a book, or magazine. Becoming a teenager is learning right from wrong. Books, movies, music, and magaizines is one of the easitst ways to get acrossed to teens.     Now for adults I understand they get more offensive for the items that are out there. They want the kids in the world to be brought up right and want them to do what is right. They do not want their child to be learning and understanding everything that is bad out there in the world. So therefore, adults take items more offensive and younger people do.     In conclusion, books, movies, music, and magaizines that are offesive should not be taken off the shelves, just so a selective few can be happy.

2,"Thier are somethings that I agree with and others I don't. I agree everyone is a little over protected of thier kids but thats why they have blocks and resrictions on adult rated and @CAPS1 rated movies, and music, etc. Thier are bunch of diffrent ways you can stop kids from watcing or reading something thier not supposed to. And i'@CAPS1 gonna name off a couple of ways.     One way to stop your kid or other kids from not watching what thier not supposed to is don't do anything like that around them. Another way is to check up on your kids if thier alone for a long period of time like, on a computer or reading. I think thier are many ways to stop your kids from looking at stuff like that you just have to keep an eye on them. Now i'@CAPS1 gonna support my position on why I don't think it's bad.     One of the reasons I don't think it's bad is that a lot of good action and horror movies are @CAPS2 rated and mature. And so are a lot of good books like @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and many more. And another reason is, if they took all the stuff away from everyone we wouldn't have anything left. Like, no movies, no books, no @CAPS3, etc. And that would make life boring and useless. My last paragraph is gonna be about life without movies, music, and books.      Life without books, movies, and music. I wonder what it would be like? I don't think I want to know cause I know I can't live without music, or movies. I think life would suck without any of these cause they make us laugh, they make us smile, etc. What i'@CAPS1 trying to get at is life would suck without any of these. Now i'@CAPS1 gonna restate my intro.        I really don't agree with  removing stuff from a public place. Because a lot of places have any adult only section. And I think thats how it should be. Because a lot of good movies,music,books, and magazines would be taken away from the people that are old enough to watch them or read them.

So if everyone has the right to take the movies and books off the shelf there will not really be any book or movies left. There is some things that are offensive to some one and not to another.

There for I dont think its right to take them off the shelf where maybe i will like the movie just because it has some stuff that kids dont need to see or read.Some times the kids seeing movies about killing and stuff will make then not want to go do stuff that they was reading or watching. So some times its not a bad thing for thim to see that stuff because it might help them. but then some will think its cool and try it every one thinks diffrent so we really cant stop kids or peaple that think the rong way bye taking thing away from them. I think they sould make books, movies, and etc, censored. Maybe make the same book or movie and take the stuff thats bad out for the kids so they can still see the movie but just the bad parts are not in the movie or book.

2,"Yes, I think that some of the materials should be removed from the libraries. I think that the libraries should have more stricter computer rules.      A couple of months ago my mother and I had to go to the library to use the computer. We had to go to a library because I had a project to do, and we were having problems with our printer at home. While at the library we located the computer lab. When we walked in all the computers were taking by teenagers. We had asked the man who was in charge of the lab how long do you think the lab would be full and he just sat back in his computer chair like he could not hear me or something. They were on all @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, playing games, or listening to loud music. I don't think that you should go to the library all day just so you can sit and use the computer. They were not doing anything constructive or educational. That's why I agree on having some library materials removed because some people take advantage of them. I really needed to print some things out on the computer but we had to sit and wait for about one hour and twenty minutes.     When we finally got a chance to use the computer, it was almost closing time. My mother was very upset and so was I. It just doesn't seem fair to people who use the library correctly to have to wait forever just to use the computer. As long as I live I will never forget that day. I thought that a library was supposed to be a place where people who like to read, study, and research go. Not a place where society has taking over to sit around all day to use and abuse the computer lab just because they don't have a computers at home. I think it's just a shame the way things are now.

2,"Do you ever have that feeling when your child comes home and talks about this book they're reading, about drugs, sex, and alcohol? Maybe music, movies, or even magazines to. The feeling that they probly should not be reading that book. Maybe the library should think about it to, or the school cooperation. Some books just arent mean't for kids a certaint age to read. Yes, teens are going to be teens and read about that kind of stuff, but there should be limits on what age groups can read what books, music, movies, and magazines.      Im here to say that some of the books and magazines can be offensive to read. They talk about teens having sex and getting pregnant at times, and even hooked on drugs. Reading books is great, yes, but there are some books you should be a certaint age to read about all that kind of stuff. A book has an impact on teens, they read it and some of them get so caught up into that book on drugs or sex, they think that they can do it to. That woulf be a bad choice on there part though.     Magazines? Who would have thought that librarys now have magazines. Most librarys have a good selection of them to. Are they all suitable for kids in school to check out and read is the question. Alot of them are fun and great to look at, except one thing, some talk about sex. Some magazines talk about being addicted to drugs, being in a gang, or violence group. I think that when the kids read these kinds of things, since they see real people do they also think its ok to do it to. magazines have an impact on children to!     We all watch movies, dont we? I know alot of teens like to watch movies with friends and family. Why not go to the library and see the kind of movies you can check out. Teens go to the library alot. They go for music, books, magazines, and movies. You would think that since its a library, movies couldnt be to bad. My friend @PERSON1 and I had went to the library to check out a movie for movie night one day, and there were kids eight and nine, checking out @NUM1 movies. Now i know that certaint ages can watch certaint movies, but there has got to be limits in the librarys!      I love listening to music. It is one of my favorite things to do, at night, in the @TIME1, and whenever i get the chance to listen to it. I go to the library and check out music alot. They have a big variety, rap, rock, country, and even some with very foul language. Librarys need to understand, not everyone should be able to check out music with that kind of language. Its ok at a certaint age group, but some kids shouldnt be listening to it, and they should set an age limit on what yu can listen to and what age you have to be to check some of there stuff out.     Librarys should think more about there consumers, than other things. They should set boundries, and take off the shelf the books, magazines, movies, and music that kids at a certaint age group should not be looking at. There will always be books on there shelves, just not everyone will be able to look at some of them. There will always be music to listen to, movies to watch, and magazines to fantasize over, just not till your the right age to do it",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I believe that  certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from shelves they are on if they are found offensive. Even the quote of Katherine Paterson says if we keep removing books off of shelves there will be no books left for our children to get off the shelves. I am not saying you should agree with her, but I find her quote true.     Imagine, your in the year @NUM1, the @ORGANIZATION1 is a new country. The founding fathers only wrote the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 of the @LOCATION1 in the past couple of decades. You breeze through the @ORGANIZATION2. You read one single right that @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS4 of the @CAPS5. You get the idea to publish something. You relize you have been angry about the last few political elections. You publish a book on why you do not agree with the new major of your town. Your novel gets set into the public library, but soon gets taken out. How would you feel? Other people have books in the library why cant you? Opinion is not right or wrong. It is what you think. People cannot place the title on your work, and say it is wrong. It is an opinion, people do not have to agree.     Yes, as a young child I can remember picking up a few books in the public library my mother would have not been happy if she knew I saw them. But that should not be a reason to rip books off of their shelves and toss them away. If parents are extremely conserned on what their children see while at the library, then at most librarys should seperate their books into an adult section and into a children section.      One of my greatest pet peeves is when someone complains about an article they read being wrong or right. Sometimes I tell people 'The writer does what he/she wants.' I believe this is true. The @CAPS4 of the @CAPS5 people can write about what they want either offensive or not.     The thought of people tearing books out of shelves disgusts me. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed off of their shelves. It is against the @CAPS3, and is just plain wrong",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I think that they should remove certain materials that are offensive to someone. One thing I do not like about this subject is that when students and parents complain about the book they are reading,what can we do about. Nothing!There are so many arguments that could be reason why you should take them off the shelfs.  I am going to tell you three reason why I should be removed.  The three reasons are that they are nasty things things to see, how it effects us, and why certain material contain language.     The first reason is they contain nasty material on the cover of magazines, movies with disguiting parts, and books describing a romance of thier love and them.  I think that these children are not thinking that this is bad, but in reality it is.  Also they do not need to learn dirty things that are bad for them, because the parents wonder what they are learning. I think that what they learn, the first reaction is @CAPS1. I was in the mall one day and saw a child that was just staring a girl with just a bikni on. He told his mom and she was not happy about that. That bring me to the second reason.     I believe that the materials that contain the language is not a good thing for the young children.They want these children to see these violent movies that have bad words that should not be said by them. Another thing is that they should not read, watch, or hear things that should not be said.  One thing that is bad is rapp and rock-roll music because of the language the songs have in it.The experience I have seen is with dillon, because he always says cuss words and that is not right.  One time he was standing infront of me when he said it. I told him not to say that word again. After this reason, I get to the final reason why it needs to be removed.     I believe that it will effect our whole life because of the actions we do.  We all need to relieaze that the bad things are what gets us into trouble in the first place.  I think that our generation is horrible right now because of the language that everyone is saying.  Also that the actions that people do are just not right.  When these books try to actually want to tell the kids about what happened when they become violent, they are not even helping the kids. I have another person who is like this and his name is codi.  I saw him one day with his friends acting out and doing bad this.  I told him that I did not agree with it.  Then he told me to leave him alone.  I did and left. I think that the children should know what the good actions are not the bad ones.   I have always thought that they contain nasty materials, contain language that should not be said, and how it effects some peoples life.  I think that we should stand up for what is wrong and right.  This movies, I think, are showing what is wrong and can be right sometimes.  Also I think the language in the movies are not good for little kids.  I believe that we could change the world if we just take out the materials that are in our libraries, that conatins things that little children should not see or hear at all.  The final thing I have to say is that we could change children's life if we just give them things thtat are healthy to learn and to understand with the books that actually better for them to read instead",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I would like to tell you my view on censorship in libaries. Katherine made a good point saying that there is books we wish children never took of the book shelf, but isn't better to have them read a book that they like and not have people telling them that they can't read it. No!! No child likes to be told you can't look at that or you can't read that because I don't think that its a good influence on you. Look at it this way.. Isn't it better to have them reading a book with bad things in it then being out in the world doing it themselves? Yes it's better because you can see what that person had went through when they did that so you know you don't want that to happen to you. Don't take books from kids. Sometimes that is the only way children even get an education. Why take that from them? Thank you for your time.",2.0,3.0,4.0
2,"In many libraries across @LOCATION1 there are sections that contain material that is inappropriot for children to read. This could include offensive language, violence or something sexually explicit. I believe that these things should be removed from public libraries where children can find them. Not only should these books be removed, but also any music, movie, or magazine containing these materials.     In the world we live in today many people use offensive language. This language often carries over to books that we read. Many older people have become numb to the effects of it on themselves but would still agree that it is not good for a child in elementary school to be reading. I do not think that any book that swears once or twice should be taken off the shelf, but when the book begins swearing on every page that is a problem. Many @CAPS1 at a library might contain songs with offensive language as well. If a child hears it over and over again, then they might begin to repeat what they hear.     Another thing that occurs in many teen and adult books is violence. For what reason would a child want to be reading about one person killing another person? There is simply no reason at all. Violence in a book would have less of an affect on a child than seeing it in a movie, however. That is why the librarians should always make sure the person renting a movie is old enough to watch it. If a young child tries to rent an @CAPS2 rated movie the librarian should make that young child put it back.      One final thing that should be censored out of library books is anything too sexual for a child to be reading. If there is something in that book that you wouldn't want to talk about with your grandma, then it shouldn't be in the library where children can find it. I don't think that any one would want a young child coming up to them and asking, 'whats that mean'. That is one situation that I personally would want to avoid.      So if you have a child and want them to remain innocent to offensive language, violence, and sexual content then you should want those books off the shelves. If too many people put up a fight about it then at least get them put on the top rows so the children can't reach them. Children do not need to be exposed to those things from the books of public libraries",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"When someone finds a book, music, magazine, movie, or anything in this category offensive, should it be removed and/or thrown away out of that library/store? People @MONTH1 think that it should or not, but in my opinion, I honestly do not think that these materials should not be thrown out of that area.     The reason that I say no to this, is because everyone has their own opinion. Such as things having offensive words/visuals in a book, movie, music, etc. that talks about racist stuff against @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or any other race, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but there is a reason that somebody wrote it and there's a reason that it is there for. Everyone likes different types of things to watch, listen to, read about, and even to do. For example, I like to play sports, watch sports channels/games, be active, listen to rap and some country, read types of adventure books, and read sports magazines. Others @MONTH1 fine this stuff boring or dumb, I find it fun and enjoyable.     I am not a racist person, but a friendly and kind person to other religions, and skin color. Other people in this world like the @CAPS3.@CAPS3.@CAPS3. are racist and do not like colored people at all. Let's say that a @CAPS1 @CAPS5 walks into a library or store that has books or magazines and talks about the @CAPS3.@CAPS3.@CAPS3., and says they hate black people/nigers, and they should all die or something, the @CAPS1 @CAPS5 man will most likely find that very offenzive. Does this mean that this book or magazine should be thrown away or taken out from this area? I think no because there are things that people like that other people @MONTH1 not like.     From my own experience, I have found things very offensive in some things, but I do not want them thrown out of the store or library just because it has something I do not like, it is there because people like that kind of stuff and like to learn about it evern though I don't like it.     Another example of me not liking something would be, atheist and non-@CAPS9. Even though the fact people right books or talk stupid stuff about how @CAPS10 isn't real or something, doesn't mean it should be taken out. I @MONTH1 find this stuff offensive but it doesn't give any right to take it out.     In saying all of this, I do not think that it is right just for someone to not like something they see/read, that it should just be taken out just because that some people just dont like it. The quote stated by, @ORGANIZATION1 saying, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have takes off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' The reason that this Author had written this quote, is to simply state a fact that if everyone had the same right as everyone else to simply take one of the books that they disreguard the most, that we would have no book what so ever left on this earth stated at the end of his quote, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship, according to @PERSON2's @CAPS1, is defined as 'the removel or substitution of certain words, phrases, or scenes.' In many movies, they sell the movie that is seen in theaters, but then you can see the 'unrated' version. The reason it is censored is because many people think that a specific word, phrase, or scene in it is considered inappropriate and do not want to see it. But movies are not the topic here, we are talking about books, which creates a whole new idea.     '@ORGANIZATION1' is known widely by people all over the world. It is an @CAPS2 classic, and is read by the majority of high schools in the @LOCATION1. Now, parents and teachers are wanting to dispose and censor this work of literary art because of a single word, nigger. Many people cringe at this word, they hear it and their eyes widen. It was a common word used to describe a black man during the @DATE1. Now considered a racist term, society has looked down upon the word, and has proclaimed it as profanity or a 'swear' word. But how is it used @DATE2?     If you go into downtown @LOCATION2, and travel around keeping an ear out to all sorts of conversation, many interesting topics will come up, as well as slang words used to refer to one another. You will hear 'homie,' 'brotha,' 'my boy,' and many others, and one most commonly used, 'nigger.' @CAPS3 not pronounced correctly (pronunciation is 'nigga'), nigger is a term now used by many black people as a friendly reference to a close friend of yours. From what started out as a racist and belittling term, has evolved into a casual way of calling someone your friend.     So if nigger is a nice thing to say, why censor? Because of the context in which it is used. The black men are not friends of the white man, they are slaves. Nigger was just another way of putting @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in their place as the lowest class in society at that time. So now that we are getting technical in the context in which it is used, we should censor it in the form that it is used in the book, right?      '@ORGANIZATION1' is a piece of @CAPS2 art. It is known internationally, and written by one of the most famous author of all time. In @DATE3, more copies of '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1' were sold than the @CAPS7! And now, parents and teachers want to 'rewrite' it. That would completely ruin the realistic viewpoints and story that is behind it. Life back then was very different from @DATE2, so how are we supposed to understand @CAPS9, if the world keeps censoring it? We can't! There are certain things in this world that we cannot change, no matter how hard we want to. Everyone looks back on slavery and realizes what a terrible thing it was to do to all those @CAPS8. But how are we supposed to understand the mindset of that time and what went on when people are removing very important details about it? '@CAPS9 is bound to repeat itself to those who do not care to remember it.' quoted by @PERSON1 himself. If we do not learn all that went on in that time, we are destined to repeat it.     The word nigger is very offensive to others, but we cannot change what it did. People must realize what has happened cannot be changed and we must move on, learning from our fathers before us. Censorship does no good for society but cover our eyes. We cannot succeed in life if we grow up seeing that the world is peaceful and people do not hate each other and all will be well. That's not how the world is, no matter how unfortunate it is, people will hate, and people will discriminate. So show us now what mistakes were made in @CAPS9. Show us now the outcomes of actions previously committed. Show us now how we can become better people and fix the future. Show us now, and do not hide @CAPS9 from our eyes.",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Of course everyone was their own opinion on what should be seen by the complex human mind or not. But who really has a say in what we can and can't buy, have, or even just take a glance at. Who gives anyone the higher power of saying that?           If you didn't get it from the introduction i completely disagree with censorship in libraries. I mean really, if someone finds offense to anything lurking around the library that doesn't mean that they have to gaze at it all day. It doesn't mean they have to check it out either. I don't see a problem with something just laying on the shelf, waiting for someone to come along with an open mind and opinion to read it.      Who really gives the right to say that offensive thing need to be taken out of our lives? Let's see. No one. We all are set here as equals, we are all human beings going from one day to the next, living our lives as fully as possible.

I mean if this person is really worried about it, then why don't they do something a little less mellodramatic. Like the books, movies, magazines, ect. that are too mature for the littler eyes, then put them in a location where kids can not be in reach of them. Maybe even have them to where you can not check them out unless you are carded. It is so simple the things you can do without being so closed minded and over dramatic.

2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,    '@CAPS1 ANY book,' rings the teachers voice from across the library.  A boy of about ten finds a book with an interesting cover and title.  He takes it to the check-out counter.  When he hands the book to the librarian she looks at it momentarily and than sets it behind the counter.  '@CAPS2 don't you go find a different book?'  'But @CAPS2,' asks the boy.  The librarian explains that she doesn't think he will 'like' the book.  Later, he heres the librarian talking to his teacher. He heres something about the book being challenged; and that it officially not allowed to be in the children's section of the library.  She mumbles something about censorship and that the school board wants it off the shelf immediately.  The boy doesn't understand.  What does it mean when a book is challenged?  What is censorship?     Censorship is the changing, removing, and or editing of material deemed innapropriate.  Often, things that are censored are language, sexual references and other graphic material.  Graphic can be in reference to gore but also to severe emotional trama.   Drug and alcohol use are also often edited.   Censorship doesn't just accure in books, it occurs in movies, music, magazine, as well as other media outlets.     Some @MONTH1 ask what the difference between banned and censored material is.  A banned item is something that has been outlawed.  During the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @PERSON1's novel @CAPS5 @CAPS6's @CAPS7 was banned in the @LOCATION1 because of how it depicted slave owners.  The @CAPS8 government didn't like the book and so it was outlawed.  Anyone caught with the book could be put to death or punished severly by law.  In order for material to be censoredm, it must first be challenged.  Challenged material is material that has been question for appropriateness and offensiveness.  If material is found to be inappropriate or offensive, then it can be censored.  @CAPS9 material is often reviewed and adjustments are often made on availability of the material.       Who makes the decision on the material?  @CAPS9 is probably the most debated aspect of censorship.  Often times parents are the ones to rise up against controversial material especially when it effects their children.  If the material is available through the school the parents will often go to the school board.  If it is through a  business or agency, people will often go to the government to have something done.  However, whos decision is it really?  What @MONTH1 be appropriate for someone, could be highly offensive to another.        It is a personal decision about what material to listen to, view, and read.  Only, each individual can make the decision for themselves.  If it is a child that could 'use' @CAPS9 material, than it is up to the parents to allow their children to 'use' it.  Not every child should be forbidden from 'using' the material.  Parents should prescreen the things that their child wants to listen to, read, and watch.  It is the parents responsibility, not the governments and not the school board's.     The author Katherine Paterson said it best, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have take off the shelf.  But, if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf ...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS9 is true, everyone has a difference in opinion of what is appropriate and innapropriate.  If people were to take away every material that they found to be offensive (in some way) then chances are there would not be any material left for people to enjoy.  What would the world look like, if there was no material for everyone to enjoy?  What would it look like?

2,"As author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' Paterson brings up a valid point--there are innumerable books out there that have rallies against them. To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2? Inappropriate language and character racism. @CAPS6 in the @CAPS3? Again, inappropriate language and also, according to some, explicit sexual descriptions. How is it that two novels that are often required reading in high school--therefore deemed fit for teenagers--are being banned in some places?     To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 and @CAPS6 in the @CAPS3 are just two controversial books among many. Really, what book doesn't have someone who loves it and someone who hates it? The issue is not that there are opposing sides to the books--it's that some think that the opposing opinions themselves are problems. People have opinions on everything. Their favorite color, their favorite pizza topping. Does that mean that every other color or pizza topping has to be obliterated because one person dislikes them? Of course not!      The worst case scenario when someone reads a book that they find offensive is that the person is exposed to something he or she dislikes. My question is, why is this an issue? People run into things they dislike everyday--it would be abnormal not to. As a society, we have learned to deal with religious differences, cultural differences, and just differing opinions in general. In @CAPS8 @NUM1, books were taken away from society. Although it was an effort to prevent anyone from getting upset, the censoring totally backfired. No one was happy, and everyone was the same. Opinions are what distinct us from others, and ultimately what keeps society in check.   Putting up with things we disagree with--in novels, and outside of them--is just another thing that has to happen in order to keep a functional society. Although it seems like 'making everyone happy' by banning offensive books would work, @CAPS8 @NUM1 shows that ignorance is not bliss.In the @LOCATION1, the main focus is democracy and autonomy. If something as minute as an offensive book was banned, what would that say about the @LOCATION1's democracy? Paterson highlights this: '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Everyone has the right to love or hate a book, and that can't be taken away without stripping the a person of all their basic rights of choosing.     Books, movies, music and magazines should not be banned for their content. In my experience, reading a book that I didn't agree with did nothing but expand my knowledge of views other than my own. In @CAPS8 @NUM1, when books were taken away in an effort to make everyone happy, society crumbled without different opinions. Though it is far-fetched to think books would be taken away from current society, banning books is the same idea. People have a right to love or hate anything--but they do not have the right to prohibit others from loving or hating things",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"Should certain contents be taken off the shelf at our libraries? No, if something is offencive then just do not read it, just leave it on the shelf and walk away from it. In this case i agree with Katherine Paterson.     Everyone has a right to read what they want even if some of us disagree with what it is saying. It is a freedom we have and we should not take that away from our citizens.      We are known for our freedom of speach, religion, and almost everything else that other countries do not have. So why take it away? If we take that freedom away we are just like every other country out there and that is one thing i do not aprove of. Okay, so little children should not read what teenagers or adults read because thats not what they have to deal with. All in all that is the parents job to stop them from reading those tpye of materials.      If  we observe what we read and everything today as teenagers you would find that some of us read the most horrible things in life. Case in point, war, suicide, murder, rape, and drug dealing, but yet parents expect us to listen to the news when thats where the most horrible things are. We hear about all of that in the news everyday wether it be murder, drug dealing, rape, war, or suicide, the news will show it all. In books its just a book but in the news it is reality. The worst thing a child or teenager can hear is what is going on in the world.       So, that being said we should not take anything off the shelf because we heaer worse things on the news then in books.

2,"In @LOCATION1, does everyone really have their own voice? I disagree with certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., being  removed from libraries. Even if they are found offenisve, removing them would go against what @LOCATION1 stands for and our @CAPS1 rights. Censoring libraries would go against our  @CAPS2 of @CAPS3, @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5 and it would allow other people to decided for the whole society what is and is not appropiate for our libraries.     Censoring our libraries, violates our @CAPS2 of @CAPS3. It allows people to not fully express their ideas or beliefs in writting with the fear of the reprocussion of not being accepted into libraries. Authors, @CAPS8, and @CAPS9 write down things that influence them, weither it be a book, about murder, to a article,about tornadoes, its their words. Who are we to keep their words from being read or seen in the libraries.     Another @CAPS10 right it violates is the @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5.Which is the right for @CAPS8 to write what they feel is neccassary in a newspaper, weither it be factual or not and not encounter legal or any reprocussions.     If libraries did censor the materials in the building, who would decided what would be removed? Would there be a vote? Everyone would  not feel the same way in this situation. Removing an item from the library would effect everyone different. Some might be glad, some might not care, or some might be upset that it was removed.Who would have the upper hand in this situation? Whose opinion would be in affect?      I feel that libraries should not censor their materials, but i do belive that everything has a place. Things that are offensive to some people, should have an area with something that notes it is and mabe be offensive to certain people. That way people who are offended by those certain items content will not  have to be confronted with it and those who feel it is not offensive will have the opition to endulge in it",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship, in some ways, can send a strong message to those who view it. But is it really that important as some people stress it out to be? What is censorship really protecting? You are bound to see things in your lifetime that wished you never have seen, but hey, that's life. I guess the real question is, at what age should censorship be allowed?     Of course when you see a kid of adolescent age, listening, watching, or even reading something inappropriate, you think to yourself what the world has come to. When I was at that age, I had started to become more curious about things, but not to the extent that it is present day. I guess that as technology advances, the age groups seem to become more stimulated as to what is going on present day. As technology advances, you start to learn more about the outside world at what it has become and that is where censorship comes in place.     Censorship is good for some age groups, but not for all of them. For adolescents, censorship is great because you don't want them to get the wrong idea about somethings. As they start to mature, their brains start develop new ideas, they start looking at things differently, and they begin to become more curious. Everyone goes through that stage of curiosity and its only human.      I do believe that certain marterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be censored, but not removed from shelves in the libraries. Sure, somethings @MONTH1 be found offensive, but that depends on the person who finds it that way. There @MONTH1 be others who think differently and who @MONTH1 have their own opinion on what they find offensive. But everyone is different, right? Not everyone is going to think the same way and have the same opinion on censorship. Others @MONTH1 think that it is good to keep the materials on the shelves, and others @MONTH1 think that it is not such a good idea.      In the end, everyone will have their differences but things will always be found the same. Should materials that are found offensive to some people be taken off book shelves? In my opinion, no, they should not, because in doing so everything will be found offensive. Here is what I have to say, if you find it offensive, then why are you looking at it in the first place?",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Most libraries ave books in them some offensive to others do you think we should take them off. I am going to say wat I think is best. Some of them have history in them, what is going to  happen to all the books off the shelves, and some can be your religion. You be suprised wat people say about the books.     Some of the books have history in them from like your family. If you take off the books then when people look for there history or some kind of history what are they going to do because the book won't be up there. Like the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 its kind of racist if you think about it because of the confederate side had slaves and they were black. You have a big project and one of the books they need and libraries took it off the shelf. What are you going to do tell your teacher and then get an @CAPS3 on your project. Most people go in and try to find the real information in the books so that they know wat happened unlike people on the internet were some of it is false.     What is going to happen to all the books on the shelves. Were are they going to go. You can't just put them in one place there would be to many and you can't burn them thats bad for the enviroment. People could buy them but you'll have alot of extra left and if there offensive then who is going to buy them. If no one buys them then you'll have alot of books that just take up space and so just leave them oon the shelves because people can ge over books.     Some of he books can be there religon. If you take that off the shelves then they are going to be real mad. They might do something criminal like and start throwing a fit and throwing  some books around. It would be disrespectful to them to because they can be any religon and I don't think people wat to sit for like a week going threw all the books. I mean you might get it done and then they want the books back up there i think people would get real mad over that. If you throw awa books then thats just wasten trees any ways. People learn form books even if they're offensive.     So I think that you sshouldn't throw away books because it would be a waste of time, because people want to learn about history or there history, and some books have different religon",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Removed from the shelves     I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.  I agree with the quote by author Katherine Paterson that if we didn't want our children to read a certain book then we could take it off the shelf, but if everyone did that, then we wouldn't have any more books left on the shelf for any of us.     Last year, there was speculation as to whether or not @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should be a part of the cirriculum.  The language in that particular book can be offensive to some people because it uses the 'n' word.  I read To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 in middle school and it also had some offensive language.  Don't you think that if middle schoolers are allowed to read To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2, then high schoolers should be allowed to read @ORGANIZATION1.  They are both classic pieces of literature that should be in the cirriculum because they send good messages.     Another reason why certain media shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive is because almost anything could be found offensive.  If we eliminated all of the materiel that people didn't like, then there would be nothing left to read, watch, or listen to.  If there was nothing left on the shelves for people to check out, libraries wouldn't make any money.  They would go out of business.  People would lose their jobs all because others find the media offensive.     I also think that if you think that something is offensive, then you should stop reading, watching, or listening to it.  Use common sense.  For example, you wouldn't take a bite of something that you didn't like and keep eating it.  If you don't want your child to read something, then tell them not to read it, don't ruin it for everybody by completely getting rid of it.     Again, I don't believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are founf offensive.  If this happened, people would lose their jobs.  I think that if you find a book offensive, then don't read it.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I don't beleive that books that seem offensive and or movies should be taken down off of the shelves since people need to know what the world is like by reading or watching a history movie about things such as racism and descrimination.  An example of an offensive movie could be the time era where @PERSON1 tried to unite blacks and whites and yes this time era does seem offensive, but it really isn't because it tells the truth about how an african american man risked his life just to remove so much hate and racism in the world and it @MONTH1 even help lead to teens trying to figure out whether they should be racist or not. Racism is something that I do deal with almost every day of my life, but the reason this happens is because of teenager's parents that put the thought of racism into their chids heads causing them to grow up and think that way.      I even have friends that have parents that are racist and they don't believe in being racist and I bet that its because they did their own research and found out that racism isn't right and that their parents are wrong. Offensive things are said every day to thousands of teens and most of these statements come from the way that they grew up and if they actually sat down and opened up a history book, which can usually be found in LIBRARIES, then they probably would start to change their views after a while about other races and come to the conclusion that everyone is equal, no matter what color your skin is and that they really aren't any better than anyone else and there isn't anyone that's better than them.      I also understand that there are books about slave owners and people of the sort that can lead young teens into beleiving that racism is o.k., but the only way that the chance for them to pick up another book and start reading about how slaves felt and how racism was actually ended along with all of the @CAPS1 people that risked their lives in hopes of one day that a new world would come about where blacks and whites could get along and live together in harmony, we as americans need to let them have that chance by leaving the so called offensive books on the shelves and inflict better laws against racism so that we can come to this day one day one person, at a time. An persuasive law could be if the person was caught doing racist acts, as in a high schooler, the first offense would be that they would have to right the sentence '@CAPS1, mexican, etc. people are equal in every way to white, mexican, etc. ' a hundred times, the second offense would be that the person would have to write a report of the persons family history that consisted of at minimal @NUM1 paragraphs, and the final offense would be considerable expulsion. We can make a change one person at a time, but we have to work together and try three times as hard to come to the day that I stated early in my essay, and if we can't do it, then who will?",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I am against censorship, i think people should have the right to read whatever they want as long as it appeals to their intrest. Yeah some topics or subjects @MONTH1 offend other people, but its their choice as to weather or not to pick the book up and read it. But, in saying that, i believe their should at least be a proper age suggestion, or even a grade suggestion to ensure that the material is suitable for the person intreasted in the book. And that they understand the book.      You should be able to comprehend the material thea you are about to read, as opposed to being completley oblivous, or un aware of what the subject is mainly about. There are some topics that i @MONTH1 not be intrested in, but that doesnt mean someone else might enjoy the material. So to conclude this essay, i would have to say that i am against censorship, but not of all forms.",3.0,2.0,3.0
2,"I think that the libraries are resposable for their books or the things they have, but sometimes it happens that they have some materials that aren't really good for kids like movies, books, music or magazines. There are situations where the libraries can't control the problem because they don't know whos going to get that book or that movie or magazine that has offensive content. I think that  parents or someone that is mature enough should get involved with the kids or with someone whos going to get something from a library. I dont think that libraries should remove those book they just need to find ways to control the problem and not the our children get offensive books or ect.     There's many ways we can solve this problem or at least try to get control of it. First of all when a little kid goes to library asking for a book they should help him find a good book that can be good for him that is not going to show him bad stuff. that will help the libraries to not get to remove stuuf that are offensive bacause they would have control of their materials by helping the people make the right choice.     Parents should teach their child that there a lot of bad stuff out there that they need to be carefull with because sometimes  there are materials that show bad stuff or that influences little kids to do or try to act like someone that they have read about. this is like one of my own experieces because i have been to a library before and the books are there for us you can get any book you want if it is just there on the shelve but sometimes those books that you see there have bad stuff that someone like a little kid or someone whoe doen't know can get ad they can get influenced by the story sometimes by a character. You should be responsable too because the person that is in charge of the library is not going to be behing you telling you what book you should get you should be responsable for what you do and help our children be resposable in life because there's alot of stuff out there that is bad.          The other thing that libraries can do is set up  a system that they can separate the materiasl like for age.They can put the books for little kids separated from the books that are for an older child. they can also get more people in the libraries to be checking on the person that is going to get a book show them where the good books are not just let them go on their own because maybe they can get a book that is going to have bad stuff.     I think that both libraries and parents are responsable for the actions of the children because librearies are supose to have control of their materials, not just let anyone get whatever they want for example ' If a little kid goes to a library and gets a magazine or a book that is not for his age what happens if he gets like a magazine that is for an adult i think ths in tha case the resposability belong to  the library because they should not let him get that'. Don't you think that true? There are alot of ways we can help fix this, parents should get ore involved with their children that way we can help the libraries and our society to be good because is not the libraries or parents fault both are resposable and it depends how you educate your kids too!

2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 , I am an @CAPS4 and I do not believe in cersoring anything. It is our right as americans to have freedom of the press and the freedom to speak our minds. Even if the book or movies have an idea different from mine who am I to say it is wrong.      It also wrong because you can not set a standard for what is right or wrong. What one person say is wrong another will disagree. Such as on the radio and televison when someone is saying 'god damn' they bleep out the word god and not damn when many people would find damn to be cuss word. I on the other hand I find nither to be offensive.     I was reading a book that many would count as offensive. I was reading a clockwork orange.The book is about how anything comes back to you. It is not at my school because it is considered wrong. The book had some strong points to it and a clear message which could help out todays youth but because of it violence it is wrong to read.     Also someone once said 'if they burn books they burn people' and some years later they did burn people otherwise known as the holocust maybe that is true for the cersorship as well if they cersor books it wont be long before they try to cersor life.      Cersorship goes against nature as well. life is not cersored we all know what the world is really like the moment we are born so who exactly are we feeding this lie to. If we cersor things then we will also make it hard on kids they will trusting , unknowing  and set up for failure if we dont show them the truth about life.     Cersorship is wrong because no one can say what is right exactly  we were all rised different. It is wrong because it goes against our rights and it goes against nature.

2,"Everyone can think of something that is against their views and beliefs. But not everyone believes in or has the same values as everyone else around.      If you think the books, magazines, movies, and music are not for what your believe in, do not check it out of the library, or watch the movie, or even listen to the music.      Some people and their views believe in what the books and magazines have to say, what the movies show, or even the message the music is trying to get out. But then again there are people who are against it.      If you are for what they are teaching you, then check the books and magazines out, rent the movies, listen to the music. It's your own decision for what you want to do.     If you are against what they are teaching you, then ignore the fact they're even there. Don't check the books and magazines out, don't rent the movies, and don't listen to the music.     Just because you think they are wrong and giving the wrong message, doesn't mean everyone else around agrees with you. Therefore they shouldn't be totally taken off the shelves at the library, or not sold in movie stores, or even not played on the radio.     For example, I personally do not believe in racism. I cannot stand when people are rude to anyone of a differnt race aside from theirs. But every day in my town, I see people wearing the rebel flag, I hear people who make rude comments to the people of a different race, I see people doing rude things to them. But I just ignore it. That's all you can do anymore. Just ignore it, and move on.     Another example I've had with something I don't believe in would be the war. Why is our country helping other countries, such as third world countries when the same problem is happening in our own country. We will do anything to help other countries, but we never help our own. We have starving adults and children here in the @LOCATION1. But do we help them? I haven't seen it happen yet. We also have many homeless people here, without housing and food, yet we're still putting other countries first on our list.     If you read things you don't believe in in magazines and books, watch them on movies and television shows, hear it in music or on the radio, just ignore it. Just because you don't believe in what is happening doesn't mean everyone else around agrees with your point of view. If you don't like it, don't check that book out, watch that movies, or listen to that type of music.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"When kids are going to the library they are more than likely looking for a book for school. But our libraries these days getting a little out of control?      I believe that libraries in this day and age are not as useful as they were before. Not only do we have unusful magazines, but now there are unnecessary movies that libraries should not  carry. Compuer rooms are now being used in a way that is not very productive.     When I think of a going to the library for a @ORGANIZATION1, I think of magazines such as @ORGANIZATION1. I think of magazines like that because they have very good information in them that could possibly help a student write a paper, or come up with good answers for a homework assignment.      Just the other day I went to the library to find something on @LOCATION1. Of course there were @ORGANIZATION1 articles about him, but I stumbbled upon a @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1. When I saw that I was a little suprised. I believe that magazines like that should not be found in libraries because they are full of gossip and who even knows if they are true. I think that if someone wants a @ORGANIZATION1 like that, they should go to a store and purchase it on their own.     Not only are magazines getting out of control, movies are too. I feel as if libraries should just have movies that are either informative, or historical. My friend saw 'The @CAPS1' on the shelves at a local library. I think that is insane. Children should not be able to get their hands on a movie like that at a library in my opinion. It is very offensive to see things like that in a library.     Music in libraries are starting to get offensive as well. I found that libraries had @CAPS2's by @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION2. I love their music, but some of their songs are very offensive. Although many people like the rap stars of @DATE1, they should not be rented out in libraries. If I had children I would definately not want them getting their hands on those kind of @CAPS2's.      But, I do understand that things some people @MONTH1 find offensive other people do not. Therefore, I think that it is very hard for a library to take things off of the shelves because it is offensive to one person. If they did take away each thing that offends someone, more than likely there would not be very many items on the shelves anymore.     In some libraries, they have computer labs. I think that libraries should definately crack down on their rules within those computers. Last week my friend went to the library to type a paper because her computer crashed at home. I told her that it should be easy typing a paper at our library in town would be easy, so she went.     When my friend arrived she went immediately to the computer lab. She was suprised to see that the lab was full, and there were no open seats for her. So, she sat on the couch and waited until someone was finished. She began to look around and not one single person was working on something very useful. Everyone was on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Libraries are a place to study, and get work done. I feel as if they really need to start cracking down and block those sites, or set a @ORGANIZATION1 limit for people that are using them.      Overall, @DATE1 I would not go to a library except the one at school. Many libraries are just not as usefu anymore like they used to be. They are starting to be very offensive, and out of line",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Over the years censorship has lost it's integrity. Certain regulations have been added on and certain rules have been lost throughout the years. People considered it respectful if things like drugs would be out of their children's reach, but today is a new day and things have changed. Only the really horrible books should be taken off of the shelf, or atleast put an age restriction on them.      Books, music, movies, and magazines have evolved to fit a new generation.This new generation of people, that are growing and learning how to be adaults, have been exposed to a lot more than anybody could imagine. Hundreds of counts of deaths, drugs, sex, and war have been played out in front of the eyes of people through books and movies. Rappers have evolved from big city thugs to superstars and role models of the new generation.      Many of todays population can handle these things. There are certain restrictions that are there for a purpose, and those need to be respected. A movie is restricted for people older than seventeen for a reason. Drugs, sex, and violence are certainly not things that we want to be showing to first graders, but todays @CAPS1 can handle a little more. This is when libraries start to put things in different categories and age restrictions.      Different categories might include an adault section, a young-adault section, and a kids section. Most libraries today have these places pretty well mapped out for this purpose. Numerous things you would find in a required reading book in high school would upset the mothers and fathers of todays elementery. So, librarians must have decided to section it off.      Libraries should not take the books off the shelves. We learn from stories that certain things are wrong. Bad men, like @CAPS2 @PERSON1 in The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 have been created to help kids learn. If kids discovered these things by themselves it would be a different world. We study history so intensively, because we do not want it to repeat itself.      It would be very wrong of them if they allowed today's youth discover things for themselves. They might like the bad things. What kind of world would it be then? Certain books are for certain age groups, and that is how it should stay.

2,"There are many libraries in the world. All libraries contain books, types of music, movies, and magazines and other things as well. Although all libraries should be a learning environment, some @MONTH1 not be. They @MONTH1 contain books and movies with inappropriate things in them. With this, on behalf of all children, I beleive that certain books, or whatever it @MONTH1 be, should be removed from the shelves because kids @MONTH1 see pictures that they shouldn't see, @MONTH1 read about things that are not important at their age, or listen to songs that have offensive wording in them.     Kids love looking at pictures, even drawing pictures. The last thing I would want my child observing is a nasty picture that @MONTH1 be in a magazine. Magazines contain an excessive amount of information about people, most of which are famous people. In a lot of cases there are pictures of people that are practically naked. They show off their bodies in a way that is not right for children to see. For children to see their favorite actor or singer in a magazine dressed in a horrible way is not right. Kids look up to famous people, and now they @MONTH1 feel that in order to be famous, they have to do those things. Magazines with disgusting pictures in them should not be found in a library because children that want to find awesome cartoons shouldn't have to flip through one with men and women showing off their bodies to realize that it's the wrong one.      Children also love to flip through books. I know in a lot of libraries they have books that have to do with adult things. If children got ahold of these books they would be asking a lot of questions. '@CAPS1's this?' '@CAPS1's that?' For many parents, they don't want to have to explain to their children at such a young age @CAPS1 those things @MONTH1 be. No child should be able to walk through a library and have the chance to pick out an adult book.      There are many types of music out in the world. Some of which are not needed in a library. Music can be very offensive to many people. The song could be racist or just making fun of people in general.Those types of songs should not be found in a library. Kids could easily go pick out a @CAPS3 and listen to it at home not realizing @CAPS1 they chose. @CAPS1 they @MONTH1 hear is something very inappropriate. @CAPS1 kids @MONTH1 start to do is like that type of music or use those offensive words. Music with discriminating words in them should not be found in a library.     Libraries contain many books, types of music, movies, and magazines. Some of these materials @MONTH1 contain pictures that children shouldn't see, children @MONTH1 get their hands on books they shouldn't read, or they @MONTH1 listen to music that shouldn't be heard by little ears.

2,"How often do you go to a library? A lot of people go to libraries to look up information for projects, to study, to help them learn on a certain subject, or even just for the fun of it. Well who gets to decide what goes on the shelves in a library? Who gets to say if it is appropriate or not? What one person thinks is inappropriate, another person @MONTH1 think it is fine. I am going to share some very good examples of why things shouldn't be taken offensively.      I am going to give you my first example. We see a book in the library, talking about slavery and how blacks were treated so much different. If you are a colored person you @MONTH1 find that offensive, but to a lot of people that is just history. Living in this big world, we deal with hardships everyday and one of those @MONTH1 be something that is offensive to us. In all honesty, people have to learn to blow things off and grow up a little.      If a book in a library is there for people to check out, then obviously it is going to be okay for you, or anyone else to read. It @MONTH1 not be appropriate for a certain age group, but thats why libraries are divided up, to seperate things that are inappropriate for certain age groups. A lot of books, movies, and magazines are there to help us better understand things in life. Why should they be taken offensively? Yes, we @MONTH1 hope that our children or grandchildren dont see some things, but wouldn't you rather them see it on your time, rather than some friend of theirs or even a stranger tell them about it. It @MONTH1 help them better understand something one day, so really it is not offensive.      Another example @MONTH1 be, you have a big health exam  @DATE1 over sexual reproduction. It's @DATE2, and you have forgotten your book at home and you really need to study. So, you go to the library and they have documentaries, video clips, and books on sexual reproduction. Now, if some people found that offensive, and said it needed to be taken off the shelves, how would someone be able to study, or even learn more about about that topic?     My final example is going to be about a home-schooled child. There are a good percent of home-schooled children in the @LOCATION1 today. A lot of the time, those children don't really know what it is like out in reality. They have to learn everything on their own time. So they should be able to go to the library to look up things, to learn, and grow up mentally. If you take away things that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people like: the history of the @ORGANIZATION1, slavery, the epidemic of @CAPS1, sexual reproduction, the mortality of concentration camps, and maybe even a book about dating, how are those home-schooled children going to learn some things that they don't teach you in school?     A counter-point @MONTH1 be inappropriate pictures in a book. Yes, examples are nice. We really @MONTH1 not need them though. I do agree with that. Some things @MONTH1 be too gruesome, gross, unappealling, or just down right disgusting to show in books, movies, or magazines. No age group needs to see anything remotely close to that. Things can be explained deep enough in words that examples are not neccessary.       In conclusion, I hope I have proved something to you. Hopefully you have realized that things don't need to be taken offensively. A lot of things in libraries are there for people to learn and if we didn't have some of those things, a lot of our world would be in the dark on certain subjects we are faced with everyday in life and in the workforce. So, next time you think something is offensive, think again about how that @MONTH1 really help someone learn and/or grow as a person",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In todays day and age of accessing anything we can imagine just a click away, we are faced with subjective materials everyday. In order to get the most information you @MONTH1 have to fight through offensive materials. To make a thorough arguement towards a case you have to look through the most broad amount of material possible. That is why I belive that there is no reason to sensor the libraries material.      Books such as 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4 of @CAPS5' are @CAPS6 literature classics. These books are read in many schools throughouth the country. Both books have subjective material in them but are full of life lessons, and give people a possible new outlook on life. Who would be the person who decides what @MONTH1 be offensive material? My mother @MONTH1 find some things a lot more offensive then I would find them, so how would we decide what to keep an what to get rid of?      Todays youth is faced with offensive material everyday, and that is a problem. One place that a child should not have to face offensive material is a public library. It would make a great deal of sense to make a section of the library an area for only people over a certian age where that subjective material can be displayed. This way the offensive material can still serve as a source of information, and is not in the way of children.      In conclusion offensive material can serve as a pourpose of giving knowlege towards a subject and give different views on a matter.

2,I think that anything and everything to a extrem limite should be aloud on the shelves. But if its a book then no matter the book or the author it should be aloud to be on the shelves to be read . Movies on the other hand should be censored to a limite. Now if there is extrem nudity and sexeuall conduct then of course we dont want our small children or reblous teens to be seeing that but if it jus shows slight nudity or just has bad launguge that should be aloud.     There is nothing bad about hearing or reading about something 'bad'. How else do we learn? Drugs are the worst way to live a life correct? So that is a bad subject to be showing people correct? So take everything off the shelves about drugs would put a stop to it? I think not. Even though drugs are terrible keep what we know about them on the shelves to learn from it and make sure there is no way to live a life that way.      If there was nothing left to learn or be concerend about then how can we even teach half the things we do in school. In health we teach about eveything there is to know about sexuall acts and the outcomes. Is that not inaproprete to be talking about in school?

2,"People say that there is a lot of books in some libraries that are offensive or even to adult for others to read and that those types of books should be vanished from the libraries at once. They are right because im tired of children seeing books on shelfs that contain a lot of adult nudity and profound languang in them. those types of books don't belong in a public library, neither do books that talk about race and religion in a bad way.     When you walk into a library you think you would see nice books about life, things for children, and books that make everybody happy. Well you don't see those types of books anymore these days, you only see religous and hate in todays society. Would you let your children read about how today terrorists could easy kill them with out knowing? I wouldn't! These types of books could make a child become a convict in the future.     Another thing that needs to leave libraries is movies and music that contain strong body language and nudity. Would you let your child listen to a man rap about drugs and sex? I know I wouldn't. Children shouldn't b listening to the type of music, they should be listening to music they hear on disney, kids radio, and not stuff about how some dudes wheels got jacked cause he was high.     I think that libraries need to stop worring about what is best for bussiness, and start worrying about what children are learning these days from what they hear and read. If the libraries take the profound books, music, movies, magazines, and television shows out; then I believe that it will make a big difference in todays and the futures society. Dont you think so too?",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"When people step foot into a library, they expect to see a variety of books and magazines that you can choose from. Many different people and readers come through looking for many different types of books they find interesting. So should libraries be allowed to choose what is appropriate for people of all different ages to read? No, books, music, movies and magazines that contain inappropriate material should not be taken off the shelves.     Some books, music, movies, and magazines are indeed inappropriate for an elementary student, but can be appropriate for high school and college students. If there is that much of a concern that younger children are going to get there hands on the wrong material, maybe libraries should make it to where there is a seperate room for them. It should not be establised for a library and critics to make decisions that parents should be making. What is appropriate for an immature freshman and what is appropriate for a mature freshman are two different things. This should be decided by the parents and the individual.     A book that is banned is '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. The book is considered inappropriate for today's readers because of racial slurrs. What if a student is doing a project and they have to pick a book that has to do with racism back in the day? They certainly won't be able to purchase the book from there local library. This is the problem with banning books, it should be up to teachers and parents on what their students and children read. Not what the library thinks is too graphic. Even with other people, like critics that say the book, movie, music, or magazine is too inappropriate; I don't think they should have the right to ban the item for all people.      For an @CAPS3 class right now, there are books on the list to read over the @DATE1 that talk about rape, sex, drugs, etc. Are those books too graphic for the age group? Obviously not, or the teacher wouldn't have assigned them. I think that all the books, movies, music, and magazines that are deemed 'too graphic' should not be decided by the critics and/or libraries. But only by teachers, parents, and children. I for one, had to go online and buy a book because it was banned from libraries. After I read the book, I sat and asked myself why the book was banned. I went online and found out it was banned because of cursing. But while I was reading, I didn't even stop to think after I crossed a curse word. This is just another example as to why items shouldn't be banned. Some people can handle this that type of language better than others can. And if they're reading it and they feel too offended, they can stop and pick another book.      What should be done about the censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines? I think that they should be put in a different room, and if you are accompanied by an adult, you @MONTH1 enter the room. This solves the problem of the library getting into trouble because an angry parent found their child reading something they thought was too inappropriate. And it also solves the problem of students not being able to purchase a book because the library says its too graphic for them. I believe it should be up to the parent and the reader if the book, music, movie, or magazine is not suitable for the age or level of reading. I strongly believe that the items listed should not be banned from local libraries. Just because of the simple fact that it's a bit discriminating. Therefore, I believe that banning books should stop.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Should libraries censorship there magazines, books, music, movies, and etc. Well there is many different opinions about this, some people will say yes and then you will have others taht would say no. But in my opinion i think libraries should censor there stuff to a degree or have seperat areas for kids than adults.     My first reason why they should censor things is beacuse you will get nosy little kids who like to do the oppisite of what they are told, they will go into sections there are not supposed to and look at adult books and fine some pretty graphic things. Now if you have seperatr floors for kids and adults you really wouldnt have to worry about ittle kids reading or looking ath thing they are nto supposed to.     Movies should be censored because no matter what the ratings are on the movies there is always something bad in the movies. Go to the library and rent movies to watch for little one and there comes up graphic images or even language that is not suitable for the little ones.     Music also should be censored because no matter what kind of music the lyrics are awfull, the language is dirty and most parents wouldnt want there child to hear them words till they are like out of college. Library needs to be censored and suitable for boys, girls, and adults. Parents take there kids to libraries to read nice and happy books, not dirty books or magazines.     Libraries are important and they dont need to be full of dirty books and magazines. Kids love to go to libraries and look at picture books and parents wouldnt like there kid to pick up a magazine and catch them looking at dirty pictures in that magazine.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Books have been around for so long, giving us information, entertaining us and letting us see different people's views and opinions to which makes us ponder more and open our minds and accept the fact that not everyone will agree with our own thoughts.     Removing materials, such as books, music, magazines etc. that might offend some people, is wrong. Everyone has a different state of mind and might enjoy what others don't. Removing materials like that is taking away another person's hardwork, views or opinion and shielding it away from the public who they intended it for.    The library is always divided into sections and the people who might find this materials offensive can always have the choice to stay away from it.    Ofcourse, there are still extremes that should not be allowed in our library shelf such as inappropiate or extremely vulgar materials. There are always nonsense materials that doesn't only offend but leads us to a wrong way. Songs that are sang by @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper who spends half his life in jail, is definitely one example of an extreme. His songs talk about drugs, killing other people because they 'disrespect' him and other various stuff that children do not need to hear. It's offensive and potentionally harmful and those kind of materials shouldn't be in our public library. Overall, i strongly agree that removing materials in our library is not right. All materials offend at least one person at times, but if it's not potentionally harmful or an extreme, it should be left in our libraries' shelf to be picked up by people with open minds and wants to explore another person's view of what is right in their own mind.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries censorship is a very big topic for dicussion and can bring a lot of agrument with it. My opion on it is that they shouldn't really censore it because we should be able to read what we want to read. We should also be able to listen to what we want to listen along with watching what we want to watch. Some parents probably think that there kids shouldn't be reading or listening to some inapproprate stuff but really i think it should be the kids choice.       I mean if you a little kid then of course you shouldn't be able to pick out stuff that is inapproprate for you age but when your older you should have your own choice on the subject. In school libraries they are going to censore it no matter what our opion of the matter is but we should be able to get what books we want to. Its not like just because you let us choose what book we want that we are going to be more defiante or anything. We just want the freedom to choose what we read, listen to and even watch.     Most movies are made for older age groups, so its really hard to find movies for the younger generation. Even as younger kids we need some help, so maybe on the older inapproprate stuff then we @MONTH1 need a little help but that doesn't mean that you should be able to tell us what we can watch. Of course movies are going to have inapproprate stuff on them exspecial with what people are making now days but eventally we are going to want to test it out so why not let us do that now.     Magazines are a little different i think. Magazines are out in public for everyone to read and to see. I don't think they can even censore magazines because all they care about is getting a story. They aren't going to censore magazines because they don't want to lose money and if they do that there is a good chance that they will lose some. A reason they will lose some is because people want that kind of stuff in there life, they don't want a kiddy verison just because a couple people took offence to it.     Some music is really offence. I don't think you should try to censore music because thats how the artist that wrote it and sung it feels. People have a right to show how they feel. If we try to take that away then we are taking away there freedom of speech basically! Its like if i want to show my expression through how i dress then, you shouldn't be able to tell me i can't. Some music does lead to people being depressed and attempting suicide or even actually going through it but its a person's choice to listen to what they want and if they choose to listen to something that makes them depressed then thats there choice!      So basically i'm saying that libraries shouldn't have a choice to censore book, magazines, movies or music. Its our choice to do what we want and yes sometimes we need some guidance but if you tell us no we will only find a way to do the opposite of what you want us to do anyways. So i think that the best choice is to just let us do what we want and give us help when we need it or give us your opion.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"If I were to go into a library and there was a book that was offensive to me, I would want them to remove it. Although, there could be a book that I liked and someone else could take it offsensivley. There are so many people in this world that take things differently. Everybody has their own things that they like. It wouldn't be fair to remove anything because there would be nothing left.     When I was @NUM1, I met this guy. We started talking and eventually ended up dating. Well, once @DATE1 got around, my body started to act different. I told my mom about it and she took me to the doctor's. They did some tests on me and a test came back positive. The test was a pregnancy test.      If there was books, magazines, movies, etc. about being against teen prenancy, I would be some what be offensed. Teen pregnancy isn't the right thing, it should wait until marriage. But people make mistakes, and do things they shouldn't which get them into this position. I didn't plan it, and I definitely didn't expect to get that kind of news.      I would also be very offensed about abortions. Once you find out that you're pregnant, that little 'thing' inside you is no longer a 'thing'. It's a human, an innocent human. Some people don't protect theirselves from this. They shouldn't be so mad or extremely surprised that it happened. I believe that once something happens, it was probably meant to be. It just wouldn't be right if things were removed because of that one person",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Should they put books on the shelf If they are not appropriate for school or In a libary. They should remove them if they have bad stuss in them. The shelf would  be so bare if they  removed all the bad books from the shelf. They would have books bu they are getting realy bad with bad stuff. Why do schools have inappopriate stuff for the kids to read?   First of all, @CAPS1 I saw a book that was not appropiate for school, I thought @CAPS2 would be a good book. But, @CAPS1 I started reading, @CAPS2 was so bad that I had to return @CAPS2 the next day. @CAPS1 I returned @CAPS2, the people asked me @CAPS7 @CAPS2 was. I told them that @CAPS2 was inappropiate for school. I thought @CAPS2  would be a good book, but @CAPS1 i started reaing @CAPS2, was so bad that I had to return @CAPS2. They asked ' @CAPS7 was the book' and I said '@CAPS2 was good I guess'.      For example, the book was horrible because @CAPS2 was talking about the nasteys things, that syou could imagine. Then i got a new book that was a little bit better than the last one. @CAPS1 i took that one back the people asked if that one was a lot better and i said ' yes'.      Finally, If they just take all the bad books off the shelves, then the shelfs would be a little bare but not by much. If they wanted to they could get more books, but not inappopiate books for the kids to read. Libarians could get maginzines for them to look at and read. Libarians can also get a lot of things for them to do in the libary. If they just took down all the inappropriate books then maybe people would stop in more to look at the books.           In conclusion, they can take down all the nasty books and put them where nobody can find them. People would have books if they took all the bad books down.

2,Libraries are a place where anyone in need of knowledge can go to learn. People of all ages go to libraries whether it is for information or their just looking for an intresting book to fill their time. But a certain degree of censorship is definately needed in such a place.      Libraries are full young kids looking for a fun book to read with their parents. If I am a parent i don't want my children browsing for a book and coming across somthing that is inapropriate. Kids are easily influenced and if they just happen to come across a book and read a few pages you never know how that child is going to take it. The child could read it and think '@CAPS1 this kid is cool' and begin trying to repeat whatever was described to him.     I think there are a few different ways of dealing with this problem. The first that comes to mind would be to have a whole different floor for kids above the age of ten or somthing close to that. Always just have a librarian watching for kids who have run off and wondered up the stairs to the section. This would keep the information in the library but keep it blocked off from those who shouldn't have ahold of it.      The second idea i have would be to have a whole different building. Their could be a smaller building that could be the childrens library. Then somewhere near that build another library. That would be for people looking for things such as information on projects or novels intended for an older age group.     Libraries can be a great place for familys to go in search of some knowledge or fun. All that needs to be done is taking the right procautions. Once that has been taken care of all age groups of people will be free to go about without worrying. That is the kind of censorship we need in our libraries today.,4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I think that there should not be any sort of censorship in libraries. Libraries are places to find information about history or anything else. The librarians cannot change how history or whatever other topic a person found offensive.     The books in the library are written how things were or how a person wanted them to be, in fictional stories, if a person put something offensive then the person looking at it can find another book. Libraries do not need censorship because if there was, then none of the books would actually be true ;therefore, the whole library would be a fiction book store. If a person had a book removed from the shelf that they thought was offensive, later on somebody might come back looking for that book for a project in school or something important and fail their project because that person took the book off of the shelf in the library.                                                   I understand that a child might pick up a book that they should not have and bring it home, but in my thought, I think that the parents should have gone with the child instead of letting them go by themself and pick out any book they wanted. Some of the people that are complaning about censorship in libraries, I think, are irresponsible parents because they are too lazy to go with their child to go get a book with them so they let the child go pick out whatever book they want. People keep complaining of horrific things that they find in libraries in history books and other subjects, but they probably sometimes forget why those certain horrific things are there and do not even think twice about it before they talk about it to the librarian.      People are afriad for the children's sake for the censorship of books and other items in the library, which is understandable because children are very influencial especially at younger ages, but if the parents stayed with their children there would be no problem with anything because if the child picked out a book the parent thought was not right for the child, then they could just put it back and move on to another one. There, in my opinion, could be certain areas in the library that could have restrictions for certain ages. For instance, if there is a whole section that a lot of people find offensive, then the library could put a restriction that the certain section is for people eighteen and older.      In conclusion, all of the censorship and everything in libraries, I think, should not happen in libraries. I would be happy with restrictions, but not censorship.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Are offensive books and magazines to violent to read at the public library? Are they making the people in the world become violent to human nature and to other living things around them? Well I have something to tell you!          I think so and I don't think so! I think that people learn things when they are reading books and magazines. It can be either good or bad. I think that if they don't read stuff about domestic violents and all the other violents that are going on, then they will never know what is wrong or what is right.          Some people find it absolutely amusing to read about violents, while some other people try to challege themselves to read it or to just read something new. Some people imitate off of other people because of the fact that they think it is cool to see that the other person is doing it. People also like to imitate off of the book or magazine because of the fact that the things that they do in the book or magazine makes the person want to do it also and they think it is cool and okay to do. Okay lets say that in a book @PERSON1 is sleeping on his bed and @PERSON1 (the killer) creeps up on him in the middle of the night with a knife and stabs him to death with the knife and laughs a girlly laugh and jumps around and say 'I killed him, I killed him!' And then @PERSON1 comes back alive.  People, such as little kids will be entertained at this type of book because they think it is cool. Well the kids that are not so scared to read about bloody violents.          In magazines it is very different because of the fact that in the books you have to imagine by yourself. The author will let you read about it, but don't get me wrong there are somebooks that have pictures, but I am talking about the books that don't have any pictures in them. These books will sometimes have you guessing and thinking about what you are reading. But when your thinking about it you can have a mind of your own and sometimes not even be thinking the same thing the author wants you to think. In a magazine you are just looking at the picture of the violents that are going on. It makes you want to do it also.          Now! Do you understand why I think that it is a good thing and a bad thing? somethings you have to learn about and somethings are to be left alone. I just think that kids need to read about it in thier late teenage years instead of them as a child because you never know that just might be how they become.

Reason being, there are a lot of youth out there that haven't been exposed to some things that are put in book, movies and magazines.      I feel that any movie that is rated above '@CAPS1' shouldn't be on the shelves because, you never know who is looking at them. Also I strongly disagree with having magazine that exploit women, simply because I dont like the way they portray women and I dont think its right to have magazines of that nature in libraries.      Music is an another big one, music plays a key role in eveyones life. So having an explict version of an @CAPS2.D. causes more damage in than any other magazine and book or even any movie. The lyrics of music can make young people do things just because of what the songs say. So thats why I believe that if its not a clean, or edited version of an album they shouldn't be in libraries.

I don't think censorship should be in libraries. It wouldn't be fair to people who might want to spend time at a library but can't because the types of music or books they like are not there at the library because of censorship. I'v been in a case where I had a project for school that I had to get done and I went to a library and couldn't get information on my project because of censorship.     There shouldn't be censorship because in my eyes it's not right. I'm sure a lot of other people would agree with me. A library can be a place to hangout and listen to music. If there is censorship some people won't be able to hangout at a library because their type of music or books to read won't be there.     I understand why people would want censorship in a library. It's a public place where everybody can go. Some people wouldn't want to hear or listen to certain types of music.

2,"In seventh grade, I saw the movie 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2' and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was entrigued by the story of the poverty-stricken father and son who so suddenly rose to great fortune.  When I checked the book out from my school library, my mother denied me the privelage of reading it and I was told to return it immediately the following day.  I begged and complained backing myself up by saying that the movie @CAPS3 not contain any crude or suggestive material.  Unfortunately, she had previously read the book and was decisive in telling me that it @CAPS3 contain material that she @CAPS3 not want me reading.     Although disappointed, this made me realize that just because something is in the school library does not mean that it's contents are appropriate to my values.  Just this year, a friend named @CAPS4 had a book from our school library titled '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  She, just as I, became attatched to the plot.  Midway through, the book evolved into a sexual teenaged love affair.  @CAPS4 was angered and had a strong desire to finish the book, but it was so crude that she finally decided to put it down.     In today's world, the '@ORGANIZATION1' of peoples' values is vast.  Many could read a book like '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' or the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2' and take no offense, while others @MONTH1 feel extremely offended.  Because there is such a wide range, it is hard for librarians to determine whether a book should be allowed in a grade school collection.  A book that I would consider unrighteous @MONTH1 be perfectly acceptable to another student, and a librarian can not make the pass or fail decision to suit every students wishes.  The movie '@CAPS11' is favorite to many people who go to my school.  At the same time, there are many people--myself included--who thought the movie to be suggestive and offending.     There are many options that a librarian can choose from, but which is the best to most fully satisfy every student?  I think that librarians should mark the library material that contains rude humor, suggestive scenes, borderline pictures, and/or other explicit adult content.  A little sticker or marking by the @ORGANIZATION2 number would allow a student searching for materials to swiftly and conveniently determine whether he/she would find the contents appropriate to his/her moral standards.  Students like myself who are liberal in ensuring that these kinds of offensive materials are avoided would be capable of avoiding such incidents.  On the other hand, those who are either fence sitters or aren't offended at all can at least approach the material with caution, knowing that someone else (the librarian or another student) found it to be innappropriate.  If a librarian happens to not read/see/hear the material when it is added to the catalog, then another student who does can report it and request that it be given a marking.     Just as Katherine Paterson says in her quote, if everything that someone finds offensive is exiled from the libraries, its whole collection will eventually fully depleat and there will be nothing left to choose from.  This tequnique of marking material that @MONTH1 offend readers is not a @CAPS5 science, but is what I think one of the best solutions to satisfy the extreme difference in moral values that we have in our culture today.  Students @MONTH1 still read something and later report that they were offended, but at least this way they cannot say that they were not previously warned.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"'And then we have no books left on the Shelf for any of us'. This is the last sentence of a quote from @ORGANIZATION1. In the quote she states that all parents can think of books that they wouldn't want their children reading. She also states that if one parent has the right to take a book off the shelf than so do other parents. If this were allowed, not only for books, but also for music, movies, magazines, etc., then there would be nothing left to go to the @ORGANIZATION2 for. Every person has an opinion as to what they find innappropriate or offensive, but this should not stop others from being allowed to find it at their @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.     Having variaties of material available is vital for many kids in order to do their schoolwork, homework, or projects. I personally know many kids who look to the @ORGANIZATION2 for certain books that are not at their school @ORGANIZATION2 for various reasons. These reasons can be violence in the books, a crude storyline, or a number of other things censored in schools. If these same books were censored at the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 as well, then where could a child go to find the information that he or she needs? Recently I had a research paper to write about the @CAPS1, @PERSON1 (The @CAPS2 @CAPS3.I.G.). I could not find any books about him at the school @ORGANIZATION2 and I did not want to have all of my sources from the internet. My only other option was the @ORGANIZATION2. If violence and gang related material were censored at the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 then I would have been limited in my resources for the research paper. Censoring @ORGANIZATION2 libraries limits a student's resources.     Not only would censorship in libraries be limiting student resources, but recreation as well. Many people go to the @ORGANIZATION2 to find a good book to pass the time reading, or find music, movies, magazines, etc., that they find interesting. If books were be to censored off of the shelves than those seeking recreational time at the @ORGANIZATION2 would be at a lose. A person should have the right to find a certain book, @LOCATION1, @CAPS4.V.@CAPS4., @CAPS5, etc., at the @ORGANIZATION2. Why should one persons opinion effect what someone else can find at the @ORGANIZATION2?     An arguement for censorship @MONTH1 be that some material is innapproprite for children or offensive to a certian group because of race, religion, etc. However, this is solved very simply by the fact that libraries are divided into different sections. If a parent does not want their child exposed to a certain type of content on adult books, they can simply send them to the children's section of the @ORGANIZATION2. In this section are children's books, movies, and computers for them to play games for their age group on. Another section libraries have is a teenage or junior section. In this section a teen can find books focused more on teenage life and magazines teens often read. Libraries also have adult sections for more mature readers. There are even designated movie, music, and computer areas for people who wish to go there as well. It seems simple enough that if a person doesn't want to see a certain type of material they would just stay out of that section of the @ORGANIZATION2. This way it could still be there for the people that do want to read, watch, listen, and enjoy everything a @ORGANIZATION2 has to offer.     Each person has their own views on what they see as offensive or innapproprite, but these views should not stifle another persons efforts in finding what they need or want at their local @ORGANIZATION2. This limits student's resources, recreation, and is easily avoided by different sections set up in libraries. Imagine what it would be like to walk into a @ORGANIZATION2 with nothing on the shelves, just emptiness everywhere you look. That is how it will be if censorship is brought into @ORGANIZATION2 Libraries",5.0,4.0,8.0

The problem is that people are only limited to take only certain kinds of books or magazines home.

The district has to pay for the books that they're putting in their library's because they have to replace the one's that are stolen or lost. Where the district gets this money of from tax payers. There are enough problems with the ecomony trying to replace a very expensive book or magazine just for glamour or style.     If we were to take away book that people enjoy or that is offensive to others @CAPS1 good will that do? We as a reader need to learn and express ourselves through writing. By taking a book off shelf resticts the person to learn a new achivement in life whether it is right or wrong. They have to learn their mistakes for @CAPS1 they dont. Having a book that is offensive can should how us @CAPS2 express ourself from the past to the present. We need to explain that we need to know our history, and where we come from.      Taking a book off the shelfs that is offensive and putting some where that nobody will ever find is like taking a child that is uncontrollable and hiding him in a basement. That book needs to express themselves because that person that wrote that book took his/her time to write it and explain in details about the situation. I know @CAPS1 it feels like to read an offensivbe book but I have to disregard that because I have to learn my past and present. It makes me upset that people @MONTH1 @CAPS3 that way but you have to understand that it not just you, there are many other people out there who are against it or with it. It like expression '@CAPS3 the way your are because that is you, not them.'     In conclusion the best solution is to let the community decide whether it sould be removed from the media. The reason I say this is the best choice is because everyone can be active and also be involved with the community. By giving a detail explanantion about how they would or not would remove it form the media is up to the judge to make the final decision. Life as we know now is still continuously progressing and we need to take advantage about our lifespan, so that our children can read about our past. The people we know now need to learn about our history and respect that the fact it is offensive, but we have mature since then. So will ask you the right question, Do you know @CAPS1 your reading is right?",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Some libraries, if not many, have been censoring their contents in books, music, movies, magazines, and websites. The reason for this censorship in libraries is the possibility of offending a certain race, age, religion, sex, or opinions. Libraries believe that some things shouldn't be on the shelves if it were to offend someone or to discourage someone.      Many books, songs, or movie scenes can be taken into many possible perspectives that can offend one person and their personal beliefs. The slightest or smallest statement on a page, or in some lyrics can be taken in offence also. All of us have to think though if it's better to try to understand others' opinions, learn about something outside our own grasp, educate ourselves, or to just shut out all of the possible outcomes.     There are somethings that have happened in life that people have wrote about, sang about, or just produced that many people would recommend to be known or learned. Many factors today have stopped a numerous amount of different cultures from educating or involving theirselves. Wether it be about offence, interest, or beliefs, people will not learn or hear someone else's opinion. Everyone deserves to educate themselves in many different ways, including movies, music, books, magazines, or any other way of reasource.     If we didn't have any biased information, or didn't have anything that people could possibly percieve as biased, we wouldn't have  information at all. Many things can be taken the wrong way to a someone. There are a lot of religions, beliefs, and ages that can be offended with another. So would it be right to rid information about one thing if it contradicted the another?     All reasorces would be decreaced marginally if we took books, movies, magazines, or anything that offended someone or something. No person is the same as another. No one should be discrimated for their own personal bliefs. Therefore no one should be ridden of their resouces or possibility to learn.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Books, magazines, movies, and music are things a lot of people enjoy. They like to read or listen to things that interest them the most; it might be a romance novel or country music. Today in our world, there are a lot of words people don't like little kids hearing, such as in books or movies. I think movies, book, magazines, and music should be censored in libraries because they can be offensive to people, they can create harmful ideas, and they can show little kids things they aren't ready for.     When people get offended they tend to get very angry. They don't like reading or hearing things that offend them. Some people take it too far and get out of control, but there is a point were the censorship stops. If a person was to check out a book at the library to learn about slavery, and it offended them to a certain degree, it should be removed. Even though it is an emotionally hard topic to learn about there is a point where far is too far. The population of the world should be treated equally and when one culture is offended, the people need to try and eradicate that.    Some people enjoy reading about murders and mysterious crimes, but others are disgusted by it. A lot of books or movies go into great detail about a crime or murder. They show every step of the way on how that murder was done. Most parents wouldn't want their child knowing how to kill a person. That's when library's should put mature books, magazines, etc. in a certain section. If a person wanted to committ a crime, I guarantee there is a book or movie somewhere in this world that talks about that specific crime. Those books and movies generate harmful ideas to the people. They find out things they didn't even know was possible, and want to try it. Therefore, it could cause harm to them or the people around them.      Everybody knows that little kids like to touch and know everything that goes on around them. When libraries have magazines with inappropriate pictutres on the front, it's not good for children. The children might not be old enough to know certain things, and I don't think parents want their children seeing that. Also, in movies there are scenes that are inappropriate for little children. It's the parents job to make sure their children don't see it, but there is also a point where the movie directors have to stop it. The ratings on movies are changing everyday and sometimes the movie is worse than what the rating that was issued said. Overall it's not good for children to see things they shouldn't at their age.     As you can see censoring movies, books, magazines, and music would have a big impact on the society. People wouldn't get offened, children wouldn't see inappropriate things, and people wouldn't get harmful ideas. There is a point where censoring could be taken to far, but knowing that the libraries, movie stores, and music stores are doing it brings comfort to many people, especially parents",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Katherine Paterson.  I agree with her that we shouldn't be able to take a book of the shelf because people find it offensive.  Any book can be found offensive in some way.  If you could just take a book off the shelf because one person found it offensive there might not be any libraries.  Libraries should be able to contain the items they want and what people would enjoy reading, listening, or watching.  If people want a book to be banned from the library how are other people going to be able to read it?  Not all things are offensive to everyone.  If people not agree with the items the library has in it, don't pick it up.  Act like its not there and keep looking for what you came to the library for.  I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and someone @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading one simple book.     If libraries don't carry the books people want to read why would people go there?  They should carry the books that they think will make a person interested.  If they make sections in the libraries for adults and kids mothers won't have to worry about her child picking up 'that' book.  By making two different sections adults can find the items they want that @MONTH1 be offensive to younger children.  By having a children section adults won't have to look around in a bunch pf children books to find what they need.     What someone might find offensive another person @MONTH1 not.  Libraries can't ban a book because its offensive towards some people.  Other people still enjoying reading the book.  If they can't find the book in the local library because its banned, how are they suppose to read it?  Just because a book might have 'bad' words doesn't mean the material isn't suitable for people to read.  People who like the stuff that people want to ban won't be able to enjoy the books like everyone else.     If this book that people want to be banned is truely great, how would people ever find out?  What if by reading this book it changed your perspective on something huge in your life.  You'd never know because some people found something a little offensive in it.  This simple book @MONTH1 change your outlook on like.  Maybe the writer has gone through something you have and his book can help you get through it.  You won't ever find out because people don't like it.  Thats why libraries should carry every single book they can get their hands on.     I believe that libraries should contain the items they want, things that are offensive to some people @MONTH1 not be to others, and you @MONTH1 get something great out of just reading a simple book.  Libraries should contain any items they want so people don't have to miss out on a great book.  If someone finds a book offensive, don't look at it or read it again.  Who knows? Maybe this book will change your life",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"To take materials of off library shelfs is an offence against the first amedment. Taking away a book or a mavie is like taking away what the authors or directors freedom of speech on the subjest they wish to talk about. There other way to fix such a problem. The problem is not the books, movies, music, or magazines; it's that the person choose that curtain material.   My resollution to the problem leave the material alone and take matters into your own hands.          If the books or other materials were taken of the shelf then that might start even bigger problems. The library and to maker of the material don't want to make their lifes anymore complicated. To take the materials of the shelfs is even against the @CAPS1 constitution. It is there rights as an @CAPS1 citizen to be able to exprese their thoughts through material in libraries. Taking that away might make the maker feel bad or sad in ways that some people might not undersand.          Its can be up to perants,or teachers; but it is mainly up to yourself to be able to make the right choices. Its not the materials that has the problem it might be yourself. So wait and thing alittle bit before trying to make curtain acusations about the materails that will get it taken of the selfs.          So I persuade some poeple to think and regecnize that its not the materials fault. Next time your in a library and you saw a book you don't like just skip over it. Evering thing doesn't have to be such a big deal. Also remember your decetion so make the right one",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Every person in the world has different views than what you do.  People are going to disagree with each all the time and that is life.  One topic that many people disagree over is if certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, and other things should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive.  Everyone can make their own decison in what they believe in and mine would be to not remove these materials from the shelves.     It is very common for people to get offended.  In my life, I mostly get offended by what people have to say to me most of the time.  People do not think of what they have to say before they say it and it ends up being hurtful to the other person and they become offended by it.  So can people be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they offend someone?  Of course they can't.  So why should books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials have to be removed?     Everyone is entitled to make their own decisions for themselves.  If someone is offended by a book, music, a movie, a magazine, or anything else then they just simply do not have to choose to be involved with that certain piece of material again.  They can let their family or friends know how it offended them, what the topic was over, and let them make the decision to be involved or not be involved with that piece of material themselves.     When it comes to picking a piece of material, adults can make the decision for themselves, but children can not.  Children need guidance in life.  So if a child would enter a library to get a book to read, a parent or adult needs to assist them.  Parents know what is best for their child.  If the parent believes in the topic and thinks that it is ok for their child to read it,  then it is ok.  If a parent disagrees with the topic, then they do not have to let their child be involved.     People do not believe in the same things as others.  One person might be offended by a song they heard, but another person @MONTH1 learn from it.  That is another reason why certain materials should stay on the shelves.       In my life, I have read many books about teen pregnancies.  That is what motivates me to stay away from becoming sexually involved.  There are many teenagers out there that have became sexually involved and have ended up with a child at a young age.  To them, a book about teen pregnancy might offend them becaus they know that they made the wrong choice.  To others, a book about teen pregnancy might help and guide them to make a good decision and not become sexually involved.  So why take a book off the shelve that might help someone?      Everyone has their own opinion about the removal of certain materials from the shelves if they are found offensive.  My opinion is not to remove them.  Just remember that people can not be removed from the @LOCATION1 if they have offended someone.  So why should certain materials?  There is a lesson to be learned from everything you have experienced in life, even if it offended you",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"While taking your child to the local library, you make your first move toward the colorful children's book section. You scanning through '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3', your curious child pulls off a magazine from a few shelves away. The offensive material such as cursing, nudity, or racist terms are far too common in this media. Now with confusing and scarring images inside of your child's mind, no one knows what the damage could cause. In society today, I believe that offensive material found in some magazines, music, and books at libraries should be stripped off of the shelves.     We live in a world today where it is acceptable to show it all - whether it be drugs, violence, sex, or foul language. As we go through this new millenium, we allow our kids to be exposed at a younger age. At the end of the day, it is essentially up to the parent to choose whether or not this exposure is okay for their child's development. Although for many, the offensive material found on television, the internet, and books are alarming. Some try to retain their kids from such foul material, but we are all trapped; exposure is everywhere.     The library is considered a safe heaven where reading, learning, and knowledge is highly encouraged. With the growing thirst for information, the library is full of reliable information. However, rude material found in many books, magazines, music, and movies have invaded the shelves. These works have poisoned the learning of young and growing minds, as well as infected the credibility of many other sources. If one wished to seek an inappropriate piece of literature, there are many other places to find them instead of the innocent library.     In my opinion, I believe that offensive material found in libraries should be removed from the shelves. They take away the true meaning of a library, and only expose the reader to various crude imagery. Our society is opening our mind, but some things can be filtered out by choice. The intergrity of a library is lowered due to these explicit material. I am not suggesting that no exposure is good for the development as a person. However, some are unnessesary, especially on the shelves of a library. They should be swapped with educational material to follow suit of the rest of the library. A library is for the growth of curiosity through reading and knowledge through credible sources.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Do you think libraries should take movies,books,and magazines off the racks if people think they are found offensive. I say no because for one everybody has their own taste and style, secondly no because people have different religious beliefs,and lastly yes because if they have things in their just anybody can go to.     To begin with, I say no they shouldn't take stuff off the rack because, everybody is different in their own way. Also people have different styles and taste in movies, books and etc. You just can't take something off the racks because you or a group of people don't like it. Also just like you or the other people that don't like it, its another person and group out there who does like it.     Seondly, I say no they shouldn't remove some things from the racks. For example, what if someone was jewish and they took all the jews stuf down and jus left the muslim stuff up. That isn't right, and is kind of considered rascim.     Last but not least, I say yes they should remove somethings. For example, if you have a kid and if they go to the library you dont want them looking at stuff they shouldn't be looking at or reading. So in some cases i say yes they because if they are not going to have age limits or somethings they yes they need to b taking off the rack.     In conclusion, you have read da article and know what my three arguments where, and if you have forgotten they are first, I say no because everyone has different tasta and styles,secondly, no because people are different religions, and last but not least, yes because if kids be in there it needs to be monitoerd",3.0,4.0,6.0

They should keep the books,music,movies,,magazines, etc on the shelf all of the materials are use full and you can learn something for all these materials. It might not be offensive to everybody so they could leave it up there. Books can show you have to say word and show you pictures wat stuff look likes. Magazines can show you pictures and read basiclly like a book but it just got alot of pictures. I love books and the next article it gives different and new information.     Movies is just society and they jus have something that's true that happen along time ago. I seen '@DATE1' and it alot of the stuff about the world gone end. The government and other people no its not gone end in @DATE1. Movies be having to much stuff in it for the shelf.

2,"Public libraries are places where many people from all walks of life can go to find information on almost any topic imaginable. Some people find certain topics offensive and would wish books containing offensive information to be removed from the library shelves. I personally think we shouldn't because it would go against our constitutional rights, some books removed wouldn't be offensive to the majority of people, and the books that are removed could provide incredibly valuable information.      One reason we shouldn't censor libraries is because it would go against our first amendment rights. The first amendment assures citizens that they can express theirselves through writing and speech. Censoring libraries would make books that are found offensive difficult for the average person to gain knowledge from. It would also mean there would have to be a goverment ran committee that decides what books remain of the shelves and which ones are taken off. The whole purpose of the constitution was to limit goverment control especially in our daily lives. That is one reason that we shouldn't censor libraries.     Another reason that we shouldn't remove potentially offensive materials from libraries is because it @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. Everyday in the @LOCATION1 we see images of women on everything from album covers to magazines. If someone was an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 this would be extremely offensive. Would this mean that anything containing a picture of a woman would have to be removed from the library? Another person could be a @CAPS3 and find many scientific discoveries offensive. This means that any books regarding evolution, the big bang, or anything else could be banned from libraries. Followng this belief could mean that almost all books in the library would be found offensive to some group.     One of the main reasons we shouldn't censor libraries is that some books that would be removed would provide valuable information to those who need it. Many people who go to the library are taking some form of an educational course at the same time. So if someone was taking a class regarding biology it would be helpful to have extra reading material to help explain what they are studying. A major point in biology is the theory of evolution. Censoring libraries could mean that a book that would help someone understand the concept of evolution could be removed. This could seriously affect someones understanding of the natural world.     In conclusion, we use the library for many different things. We use it for gaining knowledge or to just read a good story. Censoring libraries could severely affect how we interact with libraries. We would lose the right to learn about a large variety of topics and it would promote goverment control.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Should we remove books, movies, music, and what ever else that might be discriminating off of the libraries shelf? My answer is yes and no.      Why do I say yes? I say yes because some children should not be brainwashed into believeing that some groups of people are horrible and should not be trusted because they only hear one side of the story. Not unless there are both side of the stories available to the people, the libraries should not have anything disciminating there.     Why do I say no? I say no because they should learn about the world  history and understand what happened to the world. Though I still stand by my arguement that they should hear both sides of the event, the poeple have the rights to know how science say the world was made and the evidence they have gathered to guess what happened @NUM1 million years ago.     There are many different answers for this question, and many different arguements that follows. These are my reasons and my answers.

That goes for more than one person disagreeing with that book, or movie. Everyone on the planet is not going to agree on books, movies, or magazines. So I do not believe that books, magazines, or movies should be removedfrom the shelves.                    Books, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, while the next person finds an interst in it. We will all never agree on wat books are appropriate, or non-offensive. why, because we all have opposing view points on what is right and wrong. Religion is brought into this as well. I as one person @MONTH1 say that i am athiest, take that book off of this shelf, yet that is not the right thing to do.             Magazines can become a little racy at times. Such as @CAPS1, or @PERSON1. These magazines are not taken off shelves, yet they are offensive to some people. So why should they be taken off the shelvs for being a little racy, or a differant religion that what you believe is right? They should not be, and are not taken off the shelves because only a small percentage of people believe those magazines to be offensive to them or their religion.          Movies are always varied: horror, comedy, drama, ext..  These movies have ratings, which allow certain age groups to view them. This prevents young children to see the movie if it is offensive to them. Again religion is part of this, if a movie is to christian,an athiest., can say they do not like it. If the movie is wrong doing god, a christian person will not like it.               All of these books, magazines, and movies have one thing in common. If one or more people do not like them, they do not have to go see that movie, read that book, or magazine. you have that right as a citizen, to watch what you want, and to read what you like.

They should just keep the libraries the way they are. They should have adult areas in libraries.    Adult areas in libraries is a great idea. They need to have an adult area in libraries. The adult areas would contain books, magazines, movies, and music not suted for kids. Yes they do have adult areas but they dont try to keep kids out of them.

If they take certain materials off they shelf kids today wouldnt learn whats wrong or write. I dont think they should take some material off the shelves at libraries.     In conclusion i dont think that they shouls take censored stuff off the shevels at libraries. If there is offensive stuff on the shelevs you should have not read them.

2,"Many times I have gone to the book store or library and have seen book, magazines, movies, edc., that I am just shocked that someone would even write. I look around to see if anyone else around me looks as disgusted as I do, and believe it or not no one else really seems to notice.      My view and concern is that @CAPS1 type of books or movies should not be on the shelves of a regular store or library. My concern is that they are offensive to some people and should not be displayed all over the public because the fact that children can see them.     There are thousands of people in prisons  all over the @LOCATION1 for child malesting and other things, and people do not understand where censorship in libraries has an effect on this. I strongly believe that the open display if porn and nudity have an effect on how many people we have in our prisons today.     I have many times picked up a book that i thought had an interesting title, and then was shocked be the horrible content it had inside. I thinl to myself, ' I am horrified by what is in this book, but what would a younger child think if they were to pick up this book?' I realize that a young child who has never seen censorship, @MONTH1 be really upset if they were to pick up a book and see the awful content.     My opinion on this problem is that @CAPS1 books, magazines, movies, cd's ect., are okay to be sold, but only in adult stores. My opinion is also that adult store should be outside of town, instead of right in the middle of everything. I believe if they removed censorship in libraries, and put them in adult stores only, it would be much better for our community. Libraries are supposed to be a place where children can go study, find information, or enjoy reading a book. Parents should not have to worry about there children picking up a book containign things that there child has never seen before because, people insist that it is their right to have those things publicly displayed in libraries.      Many cd's have songs that talk about things like drugs, sexual activity, nudity, and violence, @CAPS1 things are not suitable for children and should also only be sold in adult stores.     I also believe that libraries should also block certain websites to make sure that the children who come to their library are safe. Parents should not have to worry about what their children might see when they go the library or if they go to certain sections of the labrary.       Censorship is found offensive not only to me, but to many parents and other people. I believe that as far as rating goes, anything rated over @NUM1 should be sold in adult stores only. Video games rated over @CAPS2, should also only be sold in adult stores.     It is proven that if a child plays a violent video game, alot of times it causes the child to become violent. Alot of people call it 'being sheltered' if  a parent will not allow their children to watch movies rated over @NUM1 or play video games rated over @CAPS2, but I call in 'being safe'. Mant parents choose not to allow certain movies or gsmes, because they do not want to expose their children to the display of drugs, violence or nudity.      I strongly believe in cenorship being offensive and agree that it should be banned from libraries and regular stores to make the @LOCATION1 a better place to live",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Options in a @CAPS1     You can't eat that cake. You can't buy those shoes.  Imagine being told what you can and cannot do.  Each and every person in the country has rights to do what they want; weather it be sky diving or dining at their favorite restaurant the options are open.       In today's society several things could be found offensive to groups of people or even individual people.  Often times we look at how a person feels about a particular situation rather than what they learn from it.  In our libraries, we are faced with several choices and options on what books to read or which movies we want to watch.  Everybody should have the right to make their own decision on what they want to expose themselves to.       The idea behind taking certain material off the shelf due to the effect it has on people is not a bad idea, but there is another way to approach the problem.  The best way to protect people while still giving them rights is to give people a warning for what they are getting into.  With that there could be a special section in the libraries devoted to those certain types of material.     Books and other types of media, although could be offensive or inappropriate, can be eduational.  Let's face the facts that most books could be found even the slightest bit offensive to somebody.  A person could read a book that has a character that reminds them of themself and that character could be bullied.  An @CAPS2 @CAPS3 could read a book about slavery that they find to be offensive.  Contraversal problems are everywhere but often times we do not see how it effects certain people.  The people reading the books that offend them help them realize what to look out for and how to face it in reality.  Although not everybody thinks that way, it could be helpful for some, and people who read the material are at least exposed to it.       It is possible for a little kid to pick out something from the @CAPS1 that is inappropriate for their age.  In this instance it is the parent's job to step in.  If the parent does not step in then it is likely that the child already knows the kinds of things they could find in the world anyway.  Some parents believe that it is best to keep their children completely isolated, in which case a the parent would be sure to make the child puts the book or magazine back on the shelf.       The thought of putting certain material in libraries in a dedicated section is to keep people away from things if they are easily offended.  This way everybody can get what they want: to choose what they want and to be warned.  The idea does not directly tell you not to read that book, but it shows a warning to all who need it",4.0,3.0,6.0

Every kid at some point will: see, read, hear over their life time that you would think is bad but really is it just letting them know what happens later on in their life time.  I think that every kid should be able to read or watch also hear all of this stuff at a age that they have matured and know what it all means.     If everyone was with out these books or movies we wouldn't have any entirnament, without that we as a human race would be in chaos I think that if it was to come down to it there would be more wars, of even worse things could happen.  Aslo without books or some movies, music and some magazines how would our children or even ourselves remember about our pasts!?  Because with out that we wouldn't remember a thing of what we have done or what the whole world has done, it would be like starting a new.     But on the other side I myself can see that some things should be left un-seen till the person is old enough to understand it unlike a child watching a horrer film and being scared for life and worryed that it too could happen to him/her.  As it happend to one of my friends who watched a scary movie at the age of @NUM1, and he couldn't sleep, he would always come to school tired and scared, afterwards he would've just gone home and he never came out of this little thing till the age of @NUM2.  This is why something are just left un-seen but yet evey kid should have the chance to see, read, hear everything that we have.     So thats why I think nothing should be taken off book shelfs or any kind of shelfs, but I also think that there should be a age limit to what some of the kids should be able to see so that they won't grow up scared for their lives",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"No not in the least. This country is based of freedom ans as @ORGANIZATION1 freedom is what we should expect, for example is the took books related to the form of government known as @CAPS1 or any related material to it such as the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 well I personally study government and military related actions in history so i would no longer be able to learn about any of those related topics. There should never be a restriction on knowledge in our nation. When countries control what topics can be studied or read about in a  @CAPS4 forum such as a librery then that is a sign of oppression and tyrinnical control of authority which leads to war and civil unrest and terrorism. That @MONTH1 seem like a streach of affect but the basic logic and point i am trying to make remains the same. Now of course some things should not be allowed to be seen in @CAPS4 forums but seeing how that already as safe guards in place its not a current issue. Then you get to things like 'my children shouldn't be exposed to books or anything related to terrorism, violence, firearms, or unwanted views pertaining to politics, government, and at time religion depending on ones belief system, but face it wether you like it or not this world and this country you live in is filled with war, terror, fear, violence, terroism, tyrinny, oppression, and terrible uncertainty. This is why knowledge on these topics can help bring light to these subjects and even protect you in many cases.      There are two kinds of people in the world wolves and sheep. Wolves are like a unit or a gang if you will, they are @ORGANIZATION1, strong, powerfull, protected, not messed with, intemedating, and smart. They lead as others follow. Now sheep stand aside and are fearfull, paranoid, alone, and followers. Sheep generally have problems with everything like what materials should been seen in libraries because they have nothing better to do and can try to fight that, while wolves are fighting in the army, in gangs, for the police, militans, and other such organizations. Do you wonder why those people don't have problems like 'whats in the library is bad for my kids.'? Its because they are fighting a real cause that affects lives not fighting futile pointless cases of annoyance. Strong people lead the way while the weak are nothing but annoyences to society. This @MONTH1 have seemed irrelevent to the case at hand but if you think about it its deffinatly related to the topic as well as the rest of the worlds issues.      Now actual concerned parents have a right to be worried don't get me wrong thats completly different the people who do nothing but cause issues. If nthey keep paying attention to yhier kids and keep them away from unwanted materials it'll be fine. There are designated sections for kids usual as well anyway. In conclusion no libraries are doing a great job so keep it up",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Hello my name is @CAPS1 and I hear that you are trying to suppress books that you find offensive. I'm here to tell you that that might not be the best idea. There are many reasons that this @MONTH1 not be the best idea to just get rid of any book you find offensive.          Censorship is thought to be a great idea right? Well I must admit it was a reasonable solution for @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies, but it's not the best solution for books. Children will always try to do the exact opposite of what you tell them to do. Thats why when you tell a child to not watch a scary movie that is on late at night they often end up laying in the bed with their parents because they are to scared to sleep. Thats why censorship is good for @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies, so you can just block the channels you do not want your child to watch.     Libraries however should not take books off the shelves just because someone @MONTH1 find them offensive. Other people @MONTH1 find the book or magizine to be a good read. Thats why they shouldn'@CAPS2 just take books off the shelves for certain people. A better idea than getting rid of the books is simply just to put ratings on them like they do for movies or games. This would set an age limit for the books that people @MONTH1 find 'offensive' but would allow the people that enjoy to read them to still have access to them. Kids would no longer be able to just pick up any of these offensive books from the library to borrow, which would help solve the problem of parents complaining that their kids are exposed to to many offensive books.      I believe that censorship is a good idea for somethings, such as @CAPS2.V. or movies. It is not a good idea to censor books and such in the libraries. I hope you take my idea of just putting ratings on books and magizines into consideration before you just take the books off the shelves",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Who decides to ban books? Is is our parents, teachers, or principals? Also, what makes a book be on the banned books list? Katherine Paterson, a famous author, states that '... if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone can decide that a book should be banned, then there would be none left! Certian books, movies, or magazines should not be removed because help people mature, show great examples of life and the hardness that comes from it, and entertain people.      As people decide to remove books, they @MONTH1 not take into account that these books might help build character. Books that might have some suggestive content can be troublesome for a young reader. However, these books should be allowed for him or her to read when he or @CAPS1 is ready. Parents should decide when their child is ready to read a book or watch a certain television show. If children are not ready to handle what those books or movies have to offer, then they should stay away from them.     Not only should a person be ready to handle a book's content, but they should also learn the hardness of life described in it. Even if a book contains poor language at times, the moral lesson @MONTH1 be worth learning. My dad is very protective over me and tries to keep me from movies with suggestive laguage and immoral behaviors. However, if he thinks I am able to learn from these movies, then I am allowed to watch them if I can apply them to my own life.     Although people can learn from ban books, some parents let their children read these books simply because they entertain the parents' children. Because of this, kids sometimes are corrupted at a young age. Therefore, a parent has to be sure that their child can handle whatever they give the child. I understand that sometimes parents just want to escape or take a break from their childen and just let them sit infront of the television. However, they still should monitor what their children watch.     Even though my dad closely watched what I read and what I watched, I respected his decision. Nevertheless, I am allowed to read the banned books that are required during school. Some example would include To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 and Of @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. Therefore, students should be able to read banned books if their parents think they are ready. These books, and also suggestive television shows, can help children mature and grow, teach life lessons, and also entertain children.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Should there be censorship in libraries? I have read many books, listened to music, and seen some, what you could call, inapropriate movies. Everyone has as well. But even so, just because one thing upsets another doesn't make that particular thing wrong. It is in my strongest opinion that there should not be censorship in libraries.     I understand deeply that some things can be offending to some people. Those particular people, though, aren't forced to entertain themselves with that material. If they don't like it, they can avoid it. Other people @MONTH1 enjoy that item that is offensive. It's their right to. Exactly as Katherine Paterson's quote says, if everyone destroyed what they didn't like, there would be nothing left.     I do have understanding in entertainment that speaks ill in certain cases such as race, religion, size, color, gender, and anything else that discriminates peoples' differences. I find those wrong, but, again, people can avoid it. I do think, though, that there should be warnings of some sort as to alert the people who dispise it. Just think, even if those things were censored, would that end discrimination? I doubt it.     Just the other day, I read a book that was given to me by a friend. She loved it; I did not. Even so, why should I deprive other people of it? Everyone has laughed at something that would affend others. There's no doubt about it. If we lived in a time where libraries and other things were censored, we would gain no knowledge from right or wrong. If everyone did the same, there would be no good. True, it's a complicated matter, but really, you must have bad in order to have good. Plus, you must have good in order to have bad. Otherwise, there would be no way to distinguish between the two.     Lastly, I'd like to say that libraries have a right to carry whatever they please. United @CAPS1 citizens were given the right to the freedom of speech. I figure that includes the libraries. Some things, such as the race and religion, I feel should be kept to personal thoughts and not out in the open. Nothing should be ever forced upon someone. I am in no position to make those changes, though, and this is only my opinion. It is merely my freedom of speech.     So, I do think that things shouldn't be censored. I know that people @MONTH1 not agree in the things that I'm saying, but that is their opinion. A freedom that was blessed upon us long ago. I don't mean to mock the people who feel something is wrong. I've felt the same way. I would never, though, stop someone from entertaining them selves with something that I find offensive. I don't need to get into their buisness and, like I have said before, I don't need to entertain myself with what I dislike.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I personally think that yeah every person has a certain book they would not want in a library for their children to read. But in a way, at the same time you have to look at it in another way, for example, if you would want your child to have a better future for themselves, let them study or read at a library what they want to learn. In a certain time in life every human being will have to learn about things in life.      I feel that in a library that could be done well. The library has books, videos, music, news, magazines, important things that we walk right past them without even knowing it, we never think to our selfs, 'oh maybe I can learn about something new in the world and keep in touch with whats happening around us,' we walk right past that stuff like as if it was nothing. We need to wake up and learn about the world and what happens in it.      Children need to be educated in order for them to have a good future and learn about those things we are leaving behind. We gotta stop at a library and atleast learn lttle by little. That way we know things and become better people in life. And have smarter brains, because that will help you and your children be smarter people.     So stop at a library and grab a book, sit down, and learn about life. The past, the present, and the future.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"One lovely evening, I walked over to the library to get myself a nice book to read so I could relax at home.  As I was rummaging through the shelves I came across a book titled '@CAPS1 in @LOCATION2'.  I was very upset with the situation I just came across because to me @CAPS1 is too offensive it needs to be discussed about it so it isn't likely to happen in @LOCATION2 or any where else for that matter, but this book was entitled to enjoy @CAPS2 racist towards others and assume it's alright to do so.     During, my library outing I picked up the book and started to read the first couple pages while standing between the shelves.  I read two short pages and was so upset, and emotional over @CAPS1.  The first page read a short passage '@CAPS2 racist towards others is fun and should be allowed in the @LOCATION1'.  I immideatly went to the front desk and filed a complaint to the librarian.  She looked shocked and angry that I was filing a complaint to her library for the @CAPS1 book but I will not stand for this kind of disturbance.  As I looked at the librarian I appropiately looked at her and told her ' @CAPS3'm the book I'm holding is disturbing and should not be held in this library for young children to see or even adults simply because it approaches @CAPS1 is okay for children and if they read this book they would get the wrong impression and @MONTH1 start joining in on it to their classmates in school, or others in public they @MONTH1 see'. The librarian ended up @CAPS2 very quiet and appauled as well to see that this book had landed up in her library and is under her responsibility.     She then said quietly ' I'm sorry sweetie, let me take the book out of your hands and while you go look for another one to enjoy I will be taking your complaint to the office and putting the book in the banned area in storage'.  I smiled at her and said thank you very much I'm glad you understand where I am coming from.  My point is to reach out to others and let them see @CAPS1 is not right in any way shape or form, thats why the @CAPS4 even stated it years ago.       Since, @CAPS2 an older sister to two young siblings that will be willing to read in just a few years, I wouldn't want them to walk  into their library and pick up a @CAPS1 book and think it's alright for them to see and read.  @CAPS1 causes many fights, struggles and emotional distress on others.  I also come from a family with people that are a different race than me and friends that I love @CAPS2 around each and every day.  When I see them, I treat them just like their one of me because it's true your color doesn't make you who you are it's what's inside of you and your personality.      If you see anyone @CAPS2 bullied about their race take it up with a councelor or parent or just simply pull them aside and be their friend, that is truly what everyone needs in this world. A great friend that they can lean on when the going gets rough. For the library each time you go, go to a section and look for any  appropiate books, because for me just looking one by one I found one that could have changed a lot of people and by taking it up with the librarian it was banned from the library and she even made her employees help her find anymore bad ones for the children and put them in banned storage.       I believe I changed a lot of people that day because I took a risk and made a difference in someones life by taking @CAPS1 in this world seriously because it is very wrong in every way and should never be labeled on anybody because of their color their just human and the same as you & I.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Everybody has different oppinions and they are entitled to that opinion. Just because you think somebody's idea is stupid doesn't mean that you can throw it away. '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a book writen by @CAPS3 about @CAPS3's life. I do not agree with anything he says in the book, but I dont think it should by taken off the shelf. If everybody took a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then there would be no more books on the shelf.      If you take a book off the shelf that tells a teen what you don't think they should read, then you are just making it so theat they will want to read it more. Teenagers are extremely curious and love forrbiden stuff. The more an adult forrbides a teenager the more a teenager is going to want to do it. If you tell a teenager to not do something, then as soon as you look away the teenager will do what you said not to do. The internet is a backdoor that teenagers use to get around thier parents. They could just go online and look up the book.      Another reason why you should not censor books in a library is that a teenager or child will never learn of the evilness or badness in the world and will be naive. If the person, does not see both sides of an argueement then they will forever by one sided and ignorant. They will never get a look at the real world.     Taking a book off the book shelf is like taking away somebody's right to free speach. Its like somebody entering your office and destroying your paper. You can no longer voice your oppinions and no longer show the truth. Taking a book off the book shelf is not the right way to go about censoring the book. If a child or teen reads the book you should talk to them and tell them your oppinion if you really want to be heard.      If you take a book off a book shelf, then you are taking somebody's words and ripping them up. To take someone's voice away is the same as taking thier identity away. Without identity humans are worth nothing. It doesn't matter who's identity is loss no one should have to go through a loss of identity. It doesn't matter who wrote the book or what its about the author has a right to express his or her oppinion",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Books, Music, Movies, Magazines, etc., @CAPS1 do these things have in common?  These useful materials all have ratings on them wheter it be kid rated or teen rated or even an adult rating.  These ratings can mean different things.  The first problem with these ratings are that, any person no matter @CAPS1 age, can purchace and either read or watch these materials.  This poses a huge problem in our society today.  In my opinion these entertainment materials should not be taken of the shelves but that they should be supervised more closely.     I believe that these things that we call entertainment can harm the younger kids.  I believe that we should seperate these adult rated films, books, and magazines from those teen rated materials.  Along with this, both the adult and teen rated entertainment should be seperated from young children rated films.  Reasoning for this would be that the younger generations are being taught harmful things from a younger age and are being taught that these things are allowed.       Another reason for my opinion would be that these adult rated films are scarring our future of the @LOCATION1.  When I was growing up I was always taught not to curse not to lie and not to cheat.  Now days children that read these books and watch these movies are being exposed to the real world before they can handle the consequences.  This poses a huge problem because there is an ever growing number of children and when they are taught these bad habits the world gets harder and harder to live in because of the violence and other things that are portrayed to be alright.       In your community would you rather have a generation of kids who use profanity often?  Or would you rather have a generation of kids who learned from there books or movies and used them towards making the world better?  But you would say wouldnt you rather have your kids learn these bad habits early and let them make the decision to stop them!  I say no.  The reason for this is because of the likelihood that the children dont give up their habits and act the opposite of @CAPS1 they should be acting like.       Censoring the libraries have a positive and a negative outcome, I chose the safer path of which was the middle.  As I stated before I would rather the entertainment materials to be seperated by rating wheter it be kid watchable, teen watchable, and adult watchable.  But with these seperations I think they should be supervised more carefully so that younger kids aren't as easily exposed to the profanity and other major obstacles of life",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In some cases, I believe that censorship is completely necessary. TV, video games, and radio should all be censored because it, in most cases, prevents younger audiences from seeing and hearing things that are beyond their age. However, when it comes to censoring books, I absolutely abhorr it. For as long as I can remember, books have been a large part of my life, comforting me when I was sad, angry or lonely. Beautifully spun tales of romance, adventures and tragedies saved me from a world that was hard at times. I have always read at a higher level than most of my peers, and craving books that challenged my mind I turned to books that were a little less childlike. At a young age, I had read about many topics that my parents were too afraid of discussing with me. But through that, I was exposed to deeper issues than just finding the treasure or making it through a rough day. By reading, I was able to emotionally connect to a character and seeing things through their eyes. Much of what I've learned about life has come from reading. And to think of people trying to prevent children from falling in love with the sames stories I did breaks my heart. There are so many things that a child takes away from a book and learns from a book cannot even be compared to learning from school or parents. Having a connection to these stories is truly astounding.Of course, I understand why teachers and parents would want to keep children away from controversial topics. Some things are just not appropriate for a child to read. No adult in their right mind would hand an eight year old a book about sex, drugs or alcohol. But overall, I believe that no person has the right to say that a child cannot read a book because it has foul language or violence or anything else. Because who knows what that child @MONTH1 learn from that boo",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Hi, have you ever felt as if you were being disrespected mentally instead of verbally. Well thats how I feel at times when I read certain books that are are published and displayed.         There are certain books that express a certain religion and that religion @MONTH1 not be the one I pursue in my life. Although the book is telling me that  the religion I adore is not the right one, according to them and god. Which makes me  say I want to do right by god so to do so im going to have to change my ways.          In the process of doing so, I keep reading the book which  is telling me certains ways I should live my life when I'm actualli saved. As in going to chruch everyday of the week, fasting, behaving right, and just being pure in all of gods ways.          If i haven't been doing all of those things, it makes me feeel as if im in the worng all of the time like nothing I have ever did was good with god. which affends me in a big way, because if I have been living my life without all of those rules and suggestions. I feel as if i have been commiting a life full of sinery. So thats why I feel that books can be sometimes offensive",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe that books, magazines, etc. that are found offensive should not be taken off of the library shelves. One way or another somebody will find something offensive. People have to learn to not be so sensitive. I could see if the magazine was very racist or sexest, or if it was pornogrophy, but if it is a simple book on black history, then it should be left alone. I believe that if everyone took down  @NUM1 books that they found offensive, or even just one, then there would be no more books in ANY library in the @LOCATION1.      Also I believe that libraries should have a stricter policy on what they let get checked out. People steal books on a regular basis from the library. I personally know alot of people who steal. I think that books that have dorogatory words that are in the school's library should definately be removed. Who wants to hear their child cursing, and when you ask they say they got it from a book at the school library? I dont know about you but that would really anger me. The libraries should have a whole team of people to thouroughly review the books, magazines, movies, etc. that come through their doors.      Yet it is good that they have things sorted into organized sections. That makes it alot easier to tell your children which books to avoid. Me being a teenager, I usually gravitate to the young adult books. They are what interest me most of the time. Sometimes I'll venture into the adult section for a certain book, but that is only sometimes. School libraries should only have school oriented books. Research books are a good idea. In the younger schools they should only have the cartoon books with the little educational messeges in them.      More and more people are flocking to the internet these days. People see no need for libraries if they have a computer at home. So more and more the library is becoming obsolete. I personally use my computer much more than I go to the library.                     So in closing i would like to say that no, offensive books should not be taken down from shelves. People should just learn to steer away from it or get over it.",3.0,3.0,4.0

2,"Yes i do believe that books that are found offensive to people should not be on some shelves.  Some books should just not be on the shelves where kids or minors can read them.  In some cases poeple are very different and like different kinds of books.     In the case of @ORGANIZATION1, my parents did not allow me to read those books because they had referenced to the devil.As you grow older and more mature you can read books that swear or have references to different kinds of things, that little kids should not know or hear about.     I believe that books for older people or mature people should be in a different section of the library.  Those books should be far away from where the kids look for there books, and if parents let there children read books that are offensive to some people then they can take there children to the seperate section of the library and have them get a book.

2,"In my oppinion it just depends on the case.  Everyone has their own emotions, and opinions on what should be done. They can choose rather they want to read it or not read it, but just because they don't like it or take offence to it doesn't mean they have to take it off the shelf for other people ot to be interested in it.  Honestly if every person went and took just one book off of the shelf because they were offended by it, there wouldn't be any more books for any one to read.           Us having zero books would be a very horrible thing.  I mean how would we learn about religions and cultures if people just take offence from the books. We learn from not just what is around us but what also comes from our books.  They are a very important object in life.  Everyone uses them rather they mean to or not.  Instruction manuels for exsistence not everyone likes them but we still need them, so just because that one person didn't like using it and desided to take it off the shelf. Would it be fair to have to just try to put everything together with out any help? No it would be fair at all; just really hard to put together.     Music is my life honestly, but I do agree that some music is very interpropriate for younger children to process and hear. Volgure language about sex, drugs, and other things should not be in the librarys for just anyone to be able to check out. Children now a days follow there music hero and if all they hear is bad language; sex talk and drug usage then they are more prone to do it also.     With movies it mainly depends on what it is rated or what the movie is about. If it is about sex and or anything else inapropriate and or if it is raited @CAPS1 then people no younger than @NUM1 should be able to rent it with out a parents concent before hand.  Just to make sure they aren't getting them selves into trouble and seeing stuff that is not appropriate for their age group.     Magazines are sometimes very interesting but often lie. I personally only look at very few magazines, they can be interstingn sometimes but ca also be very boring!  That is only my opinion for them though. They just don't seem to interest me. Other people by chance love them. I say as log as they don't have nudeity in them they should be absolutely fine.

2,"Censorship in Libraries                                   @CAPS1: @ORGANIZATION1 in libraries is most likely a common issue in all public libraries. Books, movies, music or magazines could effect colors based on racism, violence, or other issues that people have. Some people have different beliefs or concerns about what should be put in libraries. I believe the reason why libraries have certain books is for some people like to learn about topics or different kinds of history.          I believe that movies, books, or anything other kind of resource in a library should be allowed to be in there. I know that most libraries have different sections for types of books like fiction and non-fiction. I think that in all libraries, there should be certain sections for movies, music, books, magazines and more. I understand that some people have issues with what is in libraries. For instant, some parents think that movies that contain vugar images or have violence in them should not be in the library. I think that the library should have everything, some people like to rent movies to see action and other things. I do think that nude images on a movie should be put on a higher shelf or in a different section just for grown ups, but other than that I think everything should be put in libraries.      The library is a resource to learn more about anything that you would like to learn about. Libraries have different types of books, mostly anything you would like to learn or read about is at the library. At libraries in schools, they usually do not have movies or vugar books. In schools, the librarian still has books and magazines. Libraries have books about times in the past, novels, short stories, poems, and much more. The library is a place to learn new information or just to research a topic for a school project. Usually when people go to the library and check a novel or short story out, they just want to enjoy a good book.      In my own experience, my mother and I went to the public library in @LOCATION1 to rent a few movies. My mom told me to go pick out a couple movies, so I went over @CAPS1 the movie section and just grabbed a movie that look descent and went over to my mom to give it to her. She took the movie and read the back of it and said that it looked like a good movie. We rented it and took it back home. At home, I was excited to see a new movie, so we started to watch it immediately. The movie was going great and it was really funny. About the middle of the movie, it started to get very vugar. Luckily, I was mature and took the movie out, I did not want to watch it anymore.      I think that even though a movie does not say that it has rated @CAPS2, does not mean it doesn't have vugar images in it. I know that I have seen images and read things that I did not want to, but I still think that libraries should have the freedom to have what they would like in their libraries. I do admitt that librarian's should have movies and books sorted better for the benefit of children. Other topics about the library could be that people do not want to see certain colors of people, but I think the should just grow up and go on with life. Black people and white people are living together and are civil.      I believe that censorship is common in libraries. Books, movies and resources in libraries do have things like violence, racism, and vugar images in them. A library has all of these types of things because some people like to watch and learn about certain things. A lot of people do have their opinions of what should be in the libraries, mostly parents, they would like their children to go to the library to learn and research what they like and not be seeing things that they should not. I believe that the reason why libraries have certain is for the people who like to learn about different topics or history. I would like to thank you for letting me write my concerns and opinions",4.0,3.0,6.0

2,"Do I believe certain materials such as, books, or magazines, should be removed from shelves due to it being offensive to a person. My opinion is that it should not be removed. If one person does not like the piece of information, then that is their opinion and no one elses. Someones opinion should be considered as why it should be on the shelves, not why it is based off of ones opinion. One persons opinion can destroy another persons ideas.     First, most pieces of information that are published and distributed to its customers, have vital pieces that come together in the end. What I'm trying to say is you have to read or watch the piece to get the whole book or movie. You can't judge it by the beginning. You have to review the whole thing and discuss it with others before you can criticize or promote the piece of information. Some kids I know judge the pictures of a book, without even reading it.      Second, others @MONTH1 have an opinion on it based on their religion. I know that my friends and I are not fond of the, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.' We believe that @CAPS4 created the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS5, not science. It is hard to learn something that you do not believe in. But, non-believers do believe in this @CAPS3. You cannot say a piece of information is offensive to someone else unless you really know they do, because we all have our own opinions.      And third but not last, the movie, '@DATE1', offended me. It tried to persuade me into thinking that the world will end next year, on @DATE1 at @NUM1 in the @TIME1. That upset me, but I was not going to spoil it for the whole bunch of people who might have liked it. I know it got great reviews and such. But, I will base my opinion on it from the words of the @CAPS6.      Finally, if I found something offensive about a piece of knowledge, I would not like it. But, I also would not ruin it for the people who enjoyed it. One rotten egg can spoil the whole dozen. I am just saying this because this would be similar to I ruining the end of a book cause I didn't like it. If you don't like it, don't cry about it, just move on.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"In todays libraries, there are many other types of materials other than just books you can view and check out at your command. Some of these include magazines, movies/dvds, and even music. Not all the materials are what you would call 'g' rated, some materials are just not ok for kids that are young to read and observe. I think these materials shouldn't be allowed to be seen and read by minors but, still avalible for your mature responsible adult.     Taking out the offensive materials in a library for the youth would be good, but not for the mature people the materials were written for and are suppossed to be enjoyed by. I think by putting a rating system on all the materials in the library could help for even finding want material you are really looking for. Only allowing people over a certain age to check out certain material rated for that age group.      Like for movies the rating system used to warn the viewers that whats in the movie could offend or have offending acts in them, could be used by libraries, putting certain books, magazines, and music in a certain section in the library for mature viewers.     From my own trials going to the library checking out a book and finding that it has many curse words and demoralizing acts in them, is a problem because a young kids could had checked out the same book and been soaking up the bad things in the book. This is why i think the books and other materials at the library should be sectioned off depending on rating, alright to view by an older user .     Anything someone puts the time into writing, directing, or producing I think should be allowed at a public library, because it is intended for someone but not all people. If the material in offensive it should have its own area in library for those who are mature enough to handle the information with fore warning. The public library is for all people and age groups, and should be allowed to display all materials just in the right way to the right people.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"In the world there are things that we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Many of them are movies, music, magazines, and books. These examples are created off human experiences and tell things that really happened in someone's life. However, people think these sort of things should be removed from the television, radio, and shelves, so that we are not allowed to see them. The reality is, in the real world you do not get censored from bad things and to prepare kids for life after high school, we should require them to see nudity, violence, and cursing in school.      There are things in movies, books, magazines, and music  you @MONTH1 not find offesive but there is someone out there who does. If you wanted to take away a book that you thought was offensive, then you would be taking away a book that someone else thought wasn't offensive. 'You also have the exact same right and so does someone else. And then we would have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' said Katherine Paterson. Her and I both think every book out in the world is going to be offensive to someone, so if we let someone take away any book they find obsurd then there will be no books to read, and kids will be frightened when they reach the real world and see that bad things do exist.      I think this topic is a lot like kids who are very sheltered by there parents when they are growing up. Kids that can not hang out with friends, go to social events, and can't read or watch some offensive things are at a major disadvantage later in life. I feel that they have a lot to learn when they move out of the house. I think kids should be required to read or see an offensive piece of material. I believe this because if a child has never heard a curse word or see an offensive picture, the first time they see one when they are older, they will freak out and not know what to do. However, if people wouldn't have taken it off the shelf, the child would have seen or read it, and they would know how to handle the situation because of prior knowledge.     In my own experiences, readings,and watchings, I have seen, heard, and read some offesnive things. I think that a lot of factors have played into me seeing and reading different types of material at a semi- young age. Part of it is that I have gone to public school all of my life and you are exposed to many different views at a school that is public. Many kids use curse words in every sentence and as you walk down the hallways, you hear those words. Also in a public school the teacher's are more laid back on the things we see and read. An example is in eighth grade, my @CAPS1 class watched a movie that showed naked women in it. Last year in @CAPS1 class, we read a book that used the @CAPS3- word on every-other page. The other factor is my parents and what they let me see and read. In elementary school they were very scrict on the things that I watched. I never saw a bad movie at that young of an age. In middle and high school, they have backed off a lot and allow me to watch almost anything that peaks my interest. They know the things that happen in adult life and they know the things I will see and read, and they want me to know and learn about these things before I get to college.         In the real world there are many things we find offensive to ourselves and the people around us. Books, movies, music, and magazines are based off human experinces and tell things that happen in someone's life. People think that these things should be removed from shelves, so kids can not see them. The truth is, the real world isn't censored and to prepare kids for the life after education, we need to allow them to see things life nudity, cursing, and violence in school",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Not everyone has the same taste in books, movies, music, and so forth. I don't believe that any person or group of people should decide what is available to me. I want to make my own choices. I don't need somone to do it for me. I know what to watch, read or listen to. Do you think anyone should be able to censorship movies, books, movies ect.?     Some teens might like rap, or hip hop music, alot of parents and older adults don't like it because they talk about sex, and drugs. Everybody has different taste in music, that's why there are different types. If people would ban music that wouldn't be fair for me or the people who like my music I like or different music. Music is a big part of life to me and alot of people in this world. So in my opinion music shouldn't be banned just because one person doesn't like the music. Due to some peole's objections, it doesn't mean everyone else should suffer.     Do you think certain books should be in the library? I do, but I don't think they should be banned everywhere. There should be age appropriate books. I don't think they should have porn in libraries or where any kid can get ahold of it. I don't think they should ban porn just there should be different places for different things.     I don't think they should ban any movies. If it's rated @CAPS1 then you know that a kid shouldn't be watching it. That's why they have the ratings. I think you don't have to worry about movies because theyre age rated. If your not old enough you can't watch it, you can't get in without a parent. Some people think it's bad to watch rated @CAPS1 movies, but everyone is differnt one person shouldn't stop others from watching it just because someone doesn't like it. That's why there's not just rated @CAPS1 or teen movies. The rating scale will help you decide if you want to watch it.     So, it all comes down to what you like and what you don't like. Why should everybody suffer and have to listen, read, watch what one person likes? Everybody is different in every way, and has different tastes. It wouldn't be fair for anybody to conroll another person choice. Would you like if someone banned something you like alot? Everyone would be affected in baning music, movies, books ect.

2,"I do not think items such as these should be removed from the shelves. I think this first and for most because what these item contain is more or less someones personal opinon on a surton topic. Also some people only get offended because they cant see someones elses point of veiw. Finaly people write what they want to, they have the right to say what they feel.     The books, news papers, music, movies, etc., contain peoples opinon on surton topics. They only want to express what they feel or what they think they know in the movies or music they write. They share their opinon with the public for those who agree with them. Some music artist think its okay to hit a woman so they put it in a song. Its their opinon let them have it.     The people that get offended at the things writen now a day can't see a nothers point of veiw or don't understand it. They are set in their ways. Its all they've ever known. They don't except change so they try to make everyone else change to fit their opinon.     Lastly people write what they want to, not to impress people. Its just what the feel. If you don't like it or don't agree, then don't listen, read, or watch if it offends you. Just dont tell them they can't write their opinon its their right to. Just like you have a right to judge their work.     These are the reasons why I think surton items should'nt be taken form store shelves. Its the writters personal opinon and they are intitaled to it. People cant see their point of view so the get offended. Lastly peopel have a righ tto say what they feel and what they want to write. So don't get worked up about what they say or do.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Have you ever felt offended by a book, @CAPS1, or movie that you got from your local library? I dont believe there should be any books on the shelves at any library if you find them offensive.           People dont want to go to the library to get a book that is going to bring them down mentally. Most people that go to the library are looking for a book to read so they can enjoy themselves. I know that i wouldnt go to the library to get a book that i kow is going to make me feel bad about myself. When i go to the library i am looking for a book that i know will relax my mind and take my mind off things. Not a book that will make me feel bad and put me in a bad mood.      Offensive books are not knowledgable. If you think about it, your not going to go the library looking for a knowledgable book about something and come out with a book that is going to end up offending you in some way.     There are many things in a book that make the question if it is offensive or not. Some books for example, have pictures in them. An offensive book is bad for you but yet its good in a way. Being offended is a part of life, and if you have to learn that from reading a book. So be it.      There are many life lessons tought in offensive books but not all are tought so smoothly. Sometimes, you need to get over the things that offend you. The only way that will happen is by facing the things that offend you. Facing the things that offend you in a book, is not the way to handle it. You need to face them with yourself.     But yet, some books in the library are wonderful. Some are pleasing books that you want to read. Everybody has their own opinion on books and subjects of the books.      I think one of the first things you need to do before checking out a book is read the front cover. See what the book is about. Dont judge a book off its cover. Actually get to know what the book is based on. Ways you can do that is, read the front page or even look the book up online at the library you are at. There are many ways to find a book that interest you. You just need to know how.      Now you know my thoughts on the censorship in libraries. Now you put thought into what you think about some of the books on the shelves of your local library",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Dear censorship in libraries, there are some things you need to know. It's about how the library wants to remove certain books from the shelfs if they are found offensive. They want to remove books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. That is found offensive in everyway. What I want to do is to tell you different reasons why they shouldn't do this.      First, why remove certains books that are offensive. Isn't this the reason why we choose books and read them. So we can relate to books that are similar to us, and find books that is interesting. Also every person has a different opinion then others. One person might be interested in books that are offensive. The second person might not be to interested in the offensive books. So there for, that person can walk away and doesn't have to read them. If you give a book a bad comment and you havn't even read it. You're a loser, because you don't judge a book by its cover. If you have not read it, simple as that.      Second, when removing certain materials as in music and movies from a library. The rating of your library will definitely go down. Why? Is because, teenagers and adults love music and movies. Especially music and movies that are offensive in some ways. Some teenagers love this type of music because it makes them feel different then the other crowd. For example, hardcore rock music can be very offensive. This type of music is way different then other music. So what I'm trying to say, why remove something. That's making your rating go up. Also adults love movies that are offensive in some ways too. These types of movies are probaly comedy movies, because comedy movies can talk about anything. The comedian will make that offensive topic funny, then harmful. This is why, I don't believe the library should remove music and movies that are offensive, because there's a lot of @CAPS1 that can relate to those materials.      Third and finally, the magazines can sometimes be offensive. Maybe all the time depends on whoever the owner is. Why do I think this? Is because in different magazines such as '@CAPS1' and '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. They talk about a lot of celebraties in a offensive way or they will talk about them in a good way. They do this so they can keep their rating up. @CAPS1 all over the country are into magazines that talk about celebraties and how they are doing with their everyday @CAPS2 @CAPS3. These magazine are very offensive, because they talk about celebraties personal stuff and personal problems. I don't think they need to do that, and that's why I agree on removing this kind of material out of the library.      When removing certain books out of a library. I think every owner needs to know what will happened if they proceed on doing something like that. If they wonder why their rating went down, and why @CAPS1 don't show up anymore to checkout books, and etc. It's because the certain books you guys removed. Were probably one of the reason why you guys had a high rating then others, and now everything is all coming back on you. I think in the end, there will always be different type of @CAPS1 that will like this category more then this one",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"Certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, and others things can be taken offensively. But is it the job of others to keep people away from that? Should adults, other than the parents of a child, worry about keeping children from listening and reading offensive or vulgar things that are kept in a library?      Parents worry about what their own children read and listen to but, as much as a parent tries to keep their child away, chances are they will experience vulgar and offensive things. Maybe they'll read it in a book, or hear these things from song lyrics that are played on the radio, or they could even hear things from their peers. But, at some point they will be exposed to the vulgar and offensive aspects of life. It is the parents job to teach the child that these things are wrong and they shouldn't listen or read or repeat these things.     However, i don't think that writers should have to censor vulgar or offensive things out of books, music or magazines. It's the readers or listeners choice what they read and how they take it. Also, who's to say what's offensive and what isn't? I'm sure that one person could take someting in an offensive way but, another person could take it a completely non-offensive way; it depends on the person.     For example, some comedians use racial jokes in their comedy routine. Maybe an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and a @CAPS3 go to the comedians show together not knowing the content in the comedians jokes. They get to the show and the crowd is very diverse so, neither of them feel out of place. But, when the comedian starts making jokes about @CAPS1 @CAPS5, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 gets offended but the white man that went with him doesn't see anything wrong with the comedians jokes. This sceanario shows that different races consider different things offensive.     In conclusion, i do not think that writers should have to censor things that could be taken offensivley. Let the reader decide if the text is offensive or let the listener decide if the lyrics are vulgar and inappropriate. Who's to say whats inappropriate, vulgar, or offensive? The reader or listener has the right to decide for himself and his own offspring",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"If people would like to find a certain book or magazine, where do they go? The library. When I heard that books were being taken off the shelves because it was '... a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelves.', i was confused. I didn't know why they would refuse to have that book even for someone that it would be appropriate for.      Everyone has the right to look through or check out a book if they are wanting to do so. It is their choice on whether they pick it up off the shelf or not. Therefore, for one to say that books should be removed from the libray because it offends a small portion of the people who go to the there is absurd. Quite frankly I think that many more of the questionable novels and magazines should be included in the library for the people that are not offended and that would like to read them. But I do understand that there are some books that people, mainly children, that should not look at the book, but that does not mean that the books should be taken off of the shelves, away from everyone.     I think that there is a perfectly reasonable way to solve this problem. If the library was to make a section of these seleted books, movies,magazines, and others, the problem of children getting into these so called 'not child apropriate' books would be solved.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,i belive that one way to solve the problem is to have the books split up into sesions so that if someone finds a sertian book topic or wording to be offinsive they just could skip over it. and then if they have a problem with another book they can just tell the librian about the personing behind it and the libriana can do what they thin is right. then every one is happy because the people who want to read thos certan books they are still there.      then the other people who might not find the books offinsive they might get offinded by their book being seperated from the rest. so it gos both ways. but in my opinion if that person finds a book to be offinsive then they just dont half to reed it.         but this should all be up the librarian because they are the ones who half to put up with all the people geting the books. if they think a certan book should be pulled off the shelf and put in the back than so be it if the costomer wants to reed that book they can just take five secons out of their life to ask kindly for it from the librian.     i know when i find a book ofinsive i still have respet for the individual who has put their time on wrighting the book. i know that because they sat there and put thouht into it that there must be alot of people out there who love the book.     so i think that just because one person wants it off the shelf dosnt mean that one hundered want it gone. so my thoughts on it is that the librarn has the final say. but i say leve the librarys alone they are fine as they are.,3.0,3.0,4.0

2,"To whom ever this @MONTH1 concern,     I would like to voice my opinion to this newspaper saying that I do not believe that any book, movie, magazine, or anything else of that material should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.  I know that you are probably wondering why would I not want to remove those certain things, and it is simply because there could be almost anything out there in the world that would offend somebody in some way.     Whether it be 'blacks', talking about slavery, 'whites', talking about how ignorant they are, 'gays', saying whether it is right or wrong, or 'religion', believing that @CAPS1 is better than @CAPS2. Any of these topics is offensive to at least one person out there.  Since we have all of these people that are being offended there will be all those materials removed.  When this is happening there will litterally be nothing left on the shelves!       If this were to happen, when kids or adults come in to rent a book about slavery, or a movie on gays, or even a magazine about @CAPS1, it would not be there.  Kids who are in school, such as myself, need to rent books from the library to research about a topic for an essay.  We research things of all sorts.  I can absolutely see how some of our topics to research could be a bit offensive, but that is not going to stop the teacher from assigning that certain topic.  If I am needing a big novel on a subject, and it is not in there because it's offensive to my neighbor down the street, and it gets removed, how am I going to find my information?  The answer is simple. I would not be able to.  Why should I have to suffer a good grade when one person gets offended by a book that he would probably never have to see anyways?  I should not have to.        I know that it is wrong to offend somebody, but if you think about it we all get offended at least once in our life.  It is a part of life and we just have to deal with it.  By taking the book, magazines, and movies away it is not solving anything.  It is just simply burrying the problem, its not making it go away.  This is why I think that the idea of removing books, magazines, movies, ect., is a not well thought out plan.

From science fiction and fantasy to autobiographies and novels, the different types of genres go on and on. You could chose a brightly colored pop-up book or a @NUM1-inch thick, dust-covered encyclopedia. Some books have happy and positive endings while others could be very degenerative. Should those types of negative and degrating books be allowed to sit on a library shelf?     Books that have demonic ideas, such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, should not be allowed on shelves. It speaks of nothing but evil and awful things about the @CAPS3 race. A melancholy book such as this does nothing but pollute and distort the person's brain.      Libraries also supply books that have a spirtial sense or aspect within their covers. Is imposing a religion on a reader a bad idea? These types of books will, if anything, help your aspect on life. They can give a positive attitude that could change the way you view or live your life.      Age limitations could be a new and inventive way to protect a child's eyes from reading anything that @MONTH1 harm them. For instince, a child should not be engulfed in a book that has explict language. Sex and violence should be on the list of what a child should not be able to read.      Ultimately, books of all genres, ideas, and messages should be allowed on shelves. It is the reader's choice whether to pick up a book and dive in or glance at it and move on.

2,"Experiencing life and cultur is apart of growing up, even if @CAPS3 come aross as offence to someone else.  Removing a book or movie from a library is like removing @CAPS3 from history and cultur.     Kids @DATE1 are lacking cultral knowledge.  This is because @LOCATION1 is trying to sheltar the children.  According to a survey taken in @DATE2, sixty-four percent of books were edited by removing words such as the 'n' word.  Back in the day, that word wasn't used as an offensive term, but @DATE1 @CAPS3 is.  Children need to learn that as they grow up things change.  By taking books off of the shelf because one person doesn't like @CAPS3, then we would be left with no books. Sure, some books are offensive but without those books children can't learn.  Do you want your children to lack knowledge just because one perosn does not aprove of a message that is being portrayed?      If someone told you that they do not like your shirt, are you going to get rid of @CAPS3? If your child said I do not want to eat my fruit, are you going to let them skip on something healthy?  These are questions that need to be applied into other topics as well.  A survey, taken among high school teenagers in @DATE3, asked, 'Do you listen to music with vulgar words?' @CAPS1-four percent of the kids said that they do not.  Are we going to punish the rest of the kids for listening to music with vulgar words.  Of course we are not going to.       As a tenth grader I read the book '@CAPS2 @NUM1.'  @CAPS3 was about how the world was burning books.  If you got caught with any books you would be killed.  What if that happened in society @DATE1? How would our kids get the needed education in order to succeed in daily life.       Without the books, music, magazines, movies, etc., children and even adults will not ever learn about other parts of the world.  They will learn about how lucky they are to be in @LOCATION1 because they will not have the resources to research other parts of the world.  @CAPS3 is a right to be able to read and watch movies with offensive scences and chapters because that is what happens in real life.  Life is not perfect and @CAPS3 never will be.  By getting rid of books @CAPS3 is like getting rid of our rights as americans.     Our rights in @LOCATION1 give us the right to have freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion.  Just because someone does not agree with what someone else has to say does not mean that we are just going to take that away.  Censorship is doing that to our country.

Sometimes @CAPS3 takes a movie to see what the war is like.  Sometimes @CAPS3 takes just a little vulgarity to understand the effects of things.  Sometimes all you need is a magaine to know what hair products you need.  By getting rid of what we need and what @CAPS3 takes, @CAPS3 gets rid of what people stand for.

If you find what some public libaries put on there shelves is offensive then deal with it there is other sections of the library that you can look at things. You see here in the @LOCATION1 we have what is called freedom of speech and freedom of expression! Yes some library have footage and books and article of some things that either the white people have done or what othere races or countrys have done.     And you know what there just gonna have to deal with it its history or its the atmosphere or whats going on around them so there just gonna have to deal with it if its that bad or that hard to go in to your library then either find another library or find the internet and go on there and find it. Its life and people just have to deal with it in one way or another.     This is my opinion on wether or not such meterial in a public library can be displayed and i think it should be its a public place and the same freedoms fall underneath it as anywhere else its just up to us to decide on how to handle the situation. Thank you for read this and i hope you have taken in consideration in what is either the past or the present on todays society.,3.0,2.0,3.0
2,"In libraries there are many things that needs to be taken off the shelf for plenty of reasons, people @MONTH1 not understand the possibilities and effets it @MONTH1 have on teens and minors.     I believe thats books, music, and etc. should be taken off shelves in libraries if found offensive, because it leads into alot of bad problems and effects. Music have alot of profanity in it and it leaves the teens and minors to using profanity because of librarians allowing them to take them off the shelves and check them out. I also believe that if its offensive to children then why is it placed where children things are placed at. I believe that libraries shoud personally put certain things like that into a private area where children can get to it unless a certain age. I also believe that if its offensive why take the risk of it, because when its all over the libraries would be in the wrong from the parents view for letting them check anything that wouold not be approved if it were there kids, so just keep it in a private room because it leads kids into the wrong directions in many ways.     I believe books can be very offensive because now most of teens are picking up sex books. I believe its very wrong because teens are to young to be reading things like this, because it leads them to doing majority of the things that are happening in the book because they have somewhat believed the book. The reason why I would know is because I had an past experience with a friend of mine that checked out a sex book and started doing things that had been said in the book because she believed what the author was saying was the right road to go down, my friend parents had found out and it lead the library to get in alot of trouble because she was a minor to be reading anything in this category in the book section.     I believe that if magazines are offensive , then the libraries needs to immediately take them down because there are alot of nudity in some magazines and its not a great site for children to be looking at pictures like that. I believe libraries should put them off the shelf because its not something children should be looking through around there age because they are so young. In my opinion I believe that they should be taken off the shelves because if the libraries would not approve there kids or younger siblings to do it why let other kids do somthing like this.     In conclusion, I believe that all libraries should fix this problem because it leads to alot of problems and drama, and it should all be avoided by doing a simple step and just take them off the shelves if they are offensive in any kind of way.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I do not think that books should be removed from the shelves in the libraries. If they are offensive to certain people, they don't have to read them. If kids are a problem, parents need to keep a closer eye on them.      Public libraries should have a variety of books for everyone. Meaning, different people like different things, maybe a book will be offensive to one person, but two or three others @MONTH1 be interested in it. The ones who are offended by it just don't need to read it. Not everyone is the same and not everyone has the same belief.      If i went to a library and wasn't able to find a book just because it might have been offensive to certain people, i @MONTH1 never go to that library again, that is loosing business. If more and more people look at it like i do, then there just @MONTH1 not be a library very much longer. Sometimes it's important to keep certain books in there. Maybe a middle schooler or high schooler is going to do a project for school and need the books to tell about the diversity in the world. Libraries need this variety of books on their shelves.      If younger kids getting ahold of the books is the problem, then the parents need to pay close attention to what the child is looking at. It @MONTH1 be inappropriate for a seven or eight year old, but maybe someone sixteen or seventeen would like it. As long as their parents don't mind it shouldn't be a problem for a teenager to want to read something.      If the public library were to get rid of all the books for censorship reasons they would loose business. If anything they could make different sections of the library to let parents and younger kids know that the stuff @MONTH1 not be suitable for them. Or put different markings on certain books that should only be read by eighteen or older, or books that only seven and younger would be interested in.      If not that, then there are other ways around the problem. There is no reason to take books off the shelf and loose customers just because a couple people are not going to like a book that maybe ten others will like. Libraries shouldn't have to worry about their selection of books, someone, somewhere, will eventually pick it up and read it",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Do we have the right to censor books from libaries? I think we should have the right to censor books,movies and music because not everything people put out there should be put out for kids.I think that the libraries censor things that include religon, violence, and racial rferences in video games movies and religon.     Violence is one of the worse things that should be censor because kids should be doing these things.Especially cartoons on @CAPS1,it has changed dramatically from '@CAPS2 and @PERSON2' to '@CAPS3'.It is the video games turn,because they show violence in the worse of ways.The worse video game is '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'.This  game is where you could steal cars and shoot people.Do you think this game is good for your kids?These games label like '@CAPS7 for everyone' does not help the matter.     I think censoring religons is anyones' opinion,but I think it should be censored to because this will confuse the kids and their religons.Some school libraries will not allow books like @CAPS8, @LOCATION1,or @CAPS9.Schools should teach religons because it is a family matter not public matter.If you want schools to teach your religon,take them to your religous school.     Racial references be censored because these will affect on how kids act towards other races.Schools ban the '@PERSON1'because of the racial undertones and of the @CAPS10 word.@CAPS1 shows in the @NUM1's had a lot of racist shows back then,but it had evolved a lot.Movies show a lot of racial references today and it has to be stopped.Especially army movies about @CAPS11 @CAPS12     I think kids are to gullible and learns everything they watch, read and hear.Sofor these reason tha that labraries should be allowed to censor books,music, and music.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Yes i do think if they find something at the library affensive it should be removed.Because there is already way too many things wrong with the economy now.Like racisim,racisim is one of the big problems we have in this country.If everybody would avoid the rummors and drama this country would be alot better.But everybody is worried about other peoples lifes.I would aslo have too say no though because the library is somewhere people go for help and something they take out might help them.That one little thing someone thought was offensive might have been something that would have been usefull for other little kids.",2.0,2.0,2.0
2,"Everyone enjoys a nice day at the library. You walk in the front door, look around, and see that most people are busy diving into a new and exciting book. You do not want to be the only one looking around forever to try and find a book because your so ancious to begin your reading. There are countless shelves of reading material so you just pick a random book up and go to the nearest table and flip to the first page. Then you soon relize that you have just picked up the swimsuit addition to @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Many people would think that is highly inappropreit but in my mind its just anuther peice of reading material that onyone can choose to read. I do not think people should get so worked up about a inapropriet book/magazine at a library.      Librarys have such a variety of books and magazines for people to read. There is a huge chance that there's at least a few mature books hidden away in those endless rows of books. If you let your kid go to the library to chose a new book to read and you feel like theres a chance he might pick up something he shouldn't be reading then watch him while hes picking one out. Its just that simple. The parents that get upset when they see there child reading something bad are most likely the ones who didn't bother to check what they had before they brang it home. Its there responcibility not the librarys to make sure they have a approtiet book in there hands when they leave.      Our countrys know for freedom to do things we enjoy. If some people enjoy the books that are '@CAPS3' rated then let them go crazy and pick out every '@CAPS3' rated book the library has to offer. That is there choice to do that not anyone else's. If people just began to take off the books that a few selected people find offesive to see at the library most likely there wouldnt be a whole lot to read anymore. Thats pretty much going agaist our constitution saying sertain people aren't alowed to read this and that.     The opinon of everyone are different. For example, just the other day I had scene a women at a library go up to the check out person and start complaining because the book she had said '@CAPS5' in it and her doughter read it. If I had read a book with the word '@CAPS5' in it when I was smaller I know for a fact my @CAPS7 wouldn't have a single problem with it. So there are plenty of different opinons for everybody. If all the librarys begun to get ride of all the books people had a problem with there would be nothing left. You can't go by what just a single person says or belives. If you don't like that book then you don't have to read it. Its the readers choice not the library's.     People shouldn't remove offensive books from the library. What one person thinks is offesive could be toltaly differnet from the next person who reads that book. So just go to the library and enjoy a book that you love to read. If that book happens to be inappropriet then put it back. Librarys are a place for peace of mind not a peice of contreversy and aurgument.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"If a book, article,music,etc. is offensive to some people it should not be taken off the shelves for certain reasons. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to certain people it @MONTH1 just be offensive towards you does not mean its offensive to other people. Many people in this world have thier own beliefs and opinions just like I like hip hop and rap somebody might like rock and alternative see if I listen to rock and find it offensive because the song is about hurting other people does not mean it has to come off the shelves because that would not be fair to the people that listens to that music. I would not like it if some one took off hip hop because some one thinks that talking about a girl is bad or perverted or offensive.I think if you do not like our opinons or views about what a certain person likes do not read or try to view what that person likes if you think it would offend you. For example I stay with my hip hop and do not worry bout things that I know would or might offend me. I know if I try something new it always ends up that I like what I listen to now and thats hip hop and rap. So if you like rock and alternative it is not that hard to tell the difference from rap and rock so rockers stay away from rap if you think it would offend you. Rappers stay away from rock that you think would offend you!!                                                                      @PERSON1 @CAPS1                                                                                @CAPS2",3.0,2.0,3.0
2,"'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' That quote by Katherine Paterson proves a huge point. I believe that certain materials like books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are probably offensive to everyone at some point. Some materials can be quite appealing to some people, while for others it offends them deeply. I believe that these things should not be censored, unless they are absolutely vile.      Vile in definition is something that is completely horrible, in simplicity. Materials such as devil music, books, movies, magazines etc., should definitely be censored. These things should be sensored because it puts ideas in peoples heads and could potentially make people do bad things. I know that there are a lot of bad things in the world, but half of the people who do bad things are messed up. They don't need something like all this devil stuff messing with their mind even more.      Other things that should be censored are vile graphic things. Nobody wants their child or teen to be picking up extremely graphic materials and being able to check it out, simply just because they have a library card.      On a different perspective, in my opinion nothing else in libraries should be censored. For example if you have a book about @CAPS1, a christian might love it but an atheist is not going to appreciate it. If you have rap music in your library, a teenager who is in to that might love the music, but a adult who grew up listening to the classics or the oldies might hate it. What I'm getting to is you can't just take something out of a public library just because it offends some people.      Books that many children love to read is @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 which has become a worldwide phenonmenon. I, however, know of many parents how have never let their child pick any of the books or movies up, because its witchcraft. There is nothing wrong with @ORGANIZATION2. For some children, like me when I was younger, it's a chance to escape from the real world and be able to really get into reading. I remember hating reading when I was little, until @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 that is.      Schools and even libraries want children to pick up reading, and really be interested in it. @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 has done that for some children and teens. On that note, why should we ban something from our libraries that help children? Many christian parents think that it is just 'pure devil' and will never let their children read or watch the movies. I am christian and very active in church, and I really don't see anything wrong with any of the @ORGANIZATION2 books or movies.      People get offended every day. Some by church, schools, reading material, music, etc. People are just going to have to get over it. The old quote '@CAPS2 mans junk is another mans treasure', is kind of similar to this situation. @CAPS2 person @MONTH1 not care for the type of music, reading material or movies that are in our libraries today, but another person @MONTH1 really get the content of it and enjoy it.      Going back on the quote by @PERSON1, I believe that the materials in libraries should not be censored. Just because some people find materials 'offensive', doesn't mean that they actually are. Unless the materials have something like devil stuff or is very graphic that simply does not belong in a public library, then there is no cause for censorship in libraries. Many people are different. The world would be boring if we were all the same",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I belive that removing materials from the shelves of libraries is wrong. No one's oppertunity to read a book, or watch a movie should be taken away because a handfull of people do not agree with it. Someone's oppinion should not justify wheather or not a book is 'good' or 'bad' and needs to be removed for everyone.     I understand that there are books that we don't agree with. Every person has his/her own opinion and finds certain subjects or ideas unexceptable. This opinion should not be able to control everyone else's lives also. For example, if I find a murder mystery story about a ghost too graphic and I do not believe in ghost's that is fine. I don't have to read this book. On the other hand, there might be someone who loves a good novel full of suspense and wonder at what is going to happen next. Just because I do not agree with the book and it's content does not mean that it should be taken off shelves.      Another example is music. A good number of people go to their local library to get a @CAPS1 to listen to. I know I do. If I walked in one day looking for the new @CAPS1 of my favorite @CAPS3 band and found it gone I would be very disapointed. Especially if I found out it had been taken off of shelves because someone with different religious views found it offensive. I know that there are many different religions in this world and that everyone has their own ideas, but someones views should not take away my happiness or enjoyment.      If censorship continues in libraries across the @LOCATION1, what will be left? One day we'll be taking our grandchildren to to the library so that we can pick out our favorite childhood story and read it to them. When we arrive, we will be shocked to find this story gone because a group of people didn't agree with the views of the author or ideas in the story.      In conclusion, I strongly believe that censorship should not be aloud to continue in libraries. I'm convinced that our future generations will be deprived of great literature in the years to come. This is why removing materials from the shelves of libraries for good is wrong",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,I belive that censorship is wrong! Books and magazines should be the way they were ment to be.     If the books and magazines are to bad to be read or watched by little kids than just have it where only kids in highschool can look at and if it is still to bad just for that only allow seniors to view or read it or other grades in highschool can if they have thier parents permision.     Censorship shouldnt be allowed it can be taken offinsive to people who like the book and more especially the author. Censorship is like telling the author that the book is to violent for people in school to see which is wrong cause there is a bunch more movies and all the rest in the world especially on @CAPS1.V.      The things that are offinsive should not be removed from shelfs if someone finds offensive than dotn read it or watch it. It's thier fault for doing that when they know they will be offended.     I belive that everything should be allowed for people to view or read. If they find it offensive than they should put something on the cover or back letting them know that it is. If they still want to watch or view it its thier fault cause they know it would be offended.,3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Most of us have read a book in our highschool or middle school years that had some sort of offensive materials.  These books are not meant for younger people to read so they should never be in the kids section of the library or in a middle school english class.  Once children start to mature and grow up, they will be able to move onto these books that have offensive material or profanity.  There is a good message or a great story hidden behind some of that bad material, thats why some of us highschoolers start reading some of those type of books.  There are also more reasons why offensive books should be keep on the shelves for some to admire and some to dislike.       Ovbiously there are reasons that some of us @MONTH1 not know or @MONTH1 never find out that make a book interesting.  The topics such as sex, crime, rape, and racism are things that anyone and everyone will have to deal with in every day life.  These books will be history some day but some will have offensive materials in them.  Most books will have some racism or talk about sex and bad words.  That is something that we will have to get passed when the real message is trying to be deliverd behind all of that badness.   An example of a book that has some bad material in it is '@DATE1' by @PERSON2.  This book has lots of sex and crime but relays a message of dystopias and utopias.  If you have read it there is a utopia called the @ORGANIZATION1 which is filled with greenery and beautiful sights.  The bad side is a nation called @LOCATION1 which is run by the party and a totalitarian government.  The two sides are very differnent in many ways which you will never know if you dont read it.  It is a classic book that most highschoolers read, and they have to get past the sex and crime to get to the main message.  For those of you who think it is inapropriate to have books with this kind of material in them you  should try reading a classic like '@DATE1' or 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'.  There are some disturbing and intense scenes but they are  great books that have good information about how something was in the past or how something could be if something went wrong like in @DATE1'.       For those of you that refuse to read books with profanity, sex, crime, torture, and racism.  You should try reading them and maybe you will find that behind the badness there is something that you will cherish for the rest of your life.  I would recomend 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4' by @PERSON1 for those of you who love action packed adventure novels.  There are some mental images that will appear when you read parts that @MONTH1 not be the most pleasant.  When you start to get into the novel you wont stop until you have read all three in the series.  After that you wont stop thinking about them because they are so good, and maybe you will even read them twice like I did.  Try to read one of these books and maybe you will gain a unique perspective.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Criminal @CAPS1 at @CAPS2     If there was a book about the @CAPS8 shouldn't it be taken down for violence and gore, No it shouldn't but the book about a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 going on killing spree is even tho it has the same nature has the @CAPS8.  Censorship is croupt just because you hear something you think is wrong or gruesomedosen't mean it should be censored because of your beliefs.Censoring any form of art or entertainment is an overreaction to anything that you don't like because thats what censorship is the nations strong and manipulative overraction to something very simple.     The first amendment declares are freedom of speech, but has that really been hold true just because someone says foul language. Does that mean we should censor them? Well if you want to break the first amendment then yeah go right ahead and be a little dictator just like @CAPS5. You can't decide or shouldn't decide what is bad or ok to hear for everyone thats unfair because we have many different ethnicities and cultures here.Also the reason why other kids are possibly smarter then @CAPS4 kids is because there is very little censorship if any in most countries arcoss the ocean.     Think about it would you really want your kid to say fuck and not know what it means before hand so maybe he won't say it, or would it better if you told him what it means and not to say it for that reason, so he possible won't say it. Sense lets face it when he grows up he is going to hear that word from somewhere else regardless if it's censored in the media or not.     Censorship is part of the crimianl mind @CAPS5 used it to take control of @LOCATION1 and the rest of @LOCATION2. There should be no one deciding whats bad or good to say in the media by censoring it.

2,"Some libraries contain offensive articles of knowledge; books, music, magazines, and movies that contain content that some could consider insulting or bothersome. There is a concern as to whether or not these pieces of information should be kept in libraries or removed.     Offensive books, magazines, music, and movies will always exist as long as hatred between people exists. Removing them from the library will not solve any problems, but rather would only hinder the development of a higher tier of understanding between people as a result of past mistakes. Also, some pieces of information such as these, that could be considered offensive, @MONTH1 contain important details and contributions to knowledge, such as historically important details, that would be overlooked if one simply saw the offense in the information. On the other hand, if such pieces of information are kept in libraries, they could provide a way for unrest to increase, and offend many people. This is the only legitimate reason to remove them, and it does not compete with the reasons to keep them. If history is offensive to us, then we are the ones that need to change, not history.     These articles, therefore, should be kept and not restrained. We, as humans, can all learn from our past mistakes and strive for a higher level of morality and righteousness. What was done in the past, no matter how small and insignificant or how large and ground-breaking, was done in the past and should stay in the past. We should not take offense to what has been done, but rather we should see the offense of the past and prevent it in the future. We should not cover up our mistakes and pretend they don't exist simply because they're a little painful, but rather we should embrace the truth and use it to have a greater attitude of love and forgiveness toward eachother.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Has anyone been to a library and picked up a offence book, magazine, or maybe watch a movie form there, or music. Well I belive that they should remove books, movies, music, or magazines becuase of offense.     First of all, I belive that they shold remove any books, movies, magazines, or music that have to do with either gender being sexists. This is a federal crime and can be viewed as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So reason being @CAPS1 @CAPS4 can cause embaresment. Also, some people have been abused, and this can bring back memories and a possibility of being emotionally scared.     On another note, videos, music, books, or magazines that has offense with racism should be removed because this is also a federal crime, and is still an issue everywhere today. This can ecourage bullies and harmful offenders in our community.     Last thought, some adults @MONTH1 pick up a book or watch a movie, or hear music. Most of the adults in the @LOCATION1 today have children, grandhcildren,a nd great grandchildren. So having these offensive videos and music, books, magazines or artickles can encourage and teach new generations something unacceptable. This can and will encourage teens and elementary schoolers to smoke, be akind to racist or sexist. Having more teens and children learn these new ideas can cause alot of stress on other, and a possible death.     Seeking these possibilities can cause many harmful things. Emotionally scared, death, embaresment, etc. what do you belive now? Have you thought about all of the possibilities?",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I do not believe in the censorship of libraries. It takes good reading material away from people just because a few people think it's offensive. I mean what if I just didn't like a book? I could just tell the library I think it's offensive and then no one would ever be able to read that book again.     If they removed books people thought were bad eventually there would be no books at all because not everyone thinks one thing is explicit. Everyone has there own differnet views. So someone could think a book about murder is offensive but then someone who likes to read books about murder @DATE1 say that this book is fine. Like I said, no one thinks the same books should be removed so eventually it would come down to there being almost no books in a library or, someone would get offeneded becuase there book wasn't removed.     Another point I would like to make. There books. Why does it matter if there offensive or not? If you don't like what you see then don't read it. I mean it's not like someone is making you read it right? So why not instead of making a huge deal out of it and trying to ban a bunch of books people like, why not just put teh book down and go read one that you think is less offensive. Sounds a lot easier to me.     Now to focus on the movies. Movies can be offensive. Everyone knows that and everyone also knows that there are ratings. So you wouldn't think of a @NUM1 movie being offensive while, on the other hand you would think of a rater @CAPS1 movie being offensive. It got rated @CAPS1 for something right? So instead of banning movies that people think are offensive why don't you just put on the rating '@DATE1 be offensive to some people'. That way if they get it and see it they will know it might be offensive and then they know not to get it or to read a review first.     My last point in this argument is the music category. Music is like talking to a beat or some type of instrument. If we ban some types of music that's almost like banning some types of talking. You can't go around and stop people from talking like that so why should the people who get paid to do it have to getting banned? It's banning the freedom of speech. If rappers and singers can't rap and sing then there needs to be a law that soon follows that says people can't talk like that.     In conculsion I don't think at all the there should be censorship in libraries. People just need to man up and either take the offensive material or start checking it out before they read it. It's no ones fault but there own if they get offended. The author didn't tell them to read that book. They need to have the responsibility to blame themselves for getting offended and not try to censor everyone's stuff",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I dont believe that any books, music, movies, magazines etc are offensive in any way. Im not saying that all books, movies, or magazines have inappropriate stuff in them because some of them do. Its the readers responsibilty to learn or know about the music, book, movie or magazine before they check it out. I also think that if your going to check out something you shouldn't judge it by it's cover because you never know how good what you got in your hand can be.       When a reader goes to the library it's his/her responsibility to know what type of book, magazine, music, and even movie they want to check out. If the reader sees that what they are looking for is not there, then they should explore more options. I feel like just cause you see books with inappropriate stuff in them dont mean they are terrible books.      I think that libraries should have different sections for all kinds of books. Like for example, they should seperate the ones that have bad language from the ones that don't. Libraries should also seperate the ones that have horrible or inappropriate grpahics then the ones who have regular graphics that support their ideas.      If you want to check out books, movies, magazines or even music from the library, then you should talk to the librarian so she can help you with what your looking for. If you find anything that your looking for offensive then don't check it out and put it back on the shelve and check out othr books you think might interest you. Just because you find something that you don't like or it's offensive to you don't mean you should go and ruin it for everybody else. Everyone should be able to find what they are looking for in the library because thats what libraries are for.     I enjoy reading books about the author's lives because they teach you alot about life. They talk about their experiences, the mistakes and bad decisions they made. They also mention everything they did to make their lives better. I hope to one day write a book about my life because alot has happened in my life. I personally don't mind finding and reading all types of books because each book teaches you a different thing",4.0,4.0,7.0

If it is considered  offensive to you, the consumer, then why even look at or even think about that book, movie, magazine, or article. It only makes sense to get what you can handle. I feel that hundreds of others should not have to suffer because one person doesn't like what they hear, say, or feel, while reading a certain piece. Some people love to read or watch intense or sensative entertainment. They have the books sectioned off by category. How much more easy could it be to find what YOU want to entertain you? The point that I am trying to stress is that there is a different category of entertainment for every different individual unique person living in this earth.",2.0,2.0,2.0
2,"There are many types of books that people choose that others @MONTH1 not. It @MONTH1 be because the book does not appeal to his or her taste or it is inappropriate.  Either way, it all is the same in that everyone has an opinion on what can and cannot be read, especially when thinking of the children. There are some materials that should not be read or shelved at a library where everyone can see it.  Even if there are some who @MONTH1 want to read it, there is absolutely no reason to keep it shelved and it should be removed to avoid influence towards the children and ourselves.     When one goes to the library and sees books or movies that are inappropriate, what is usually done? Well, they can walk away or choose to report to the librarian to remove the material from the shelf.  Both of these options should be what are done, because it should not be there in the library for eyes to see and it shouldn't be where you are either. The needs and safety of the children needs to be in consideration too.  A child does not and should not know as much as we do as adults.  It would affect both our children's and our lives if they ever see something that you don't want them to read out in the open. If your children are in a section where there is something that you don't want them to read, then the material needs to be removed so that they can be protected from the issues in this corrupt world.     If people started to report materials that they do not like all of the time, what will happen to the shelves full of books?  According to Katherine Paterson, an author, she says that there would be no more books left on the shelf if everyone went and picked out a book they didn't like.  Everything in this world is based off of opinion:  how one looks, their favorite sports, and their favorite books. There is no two people that are exactly alike and that is why there is so many different tastes in reading topics.       No matter their own opinion, people should consider other's thoughts on certain books.  One can't just rip a book off of the shelf because of their dislike towards it. I'm not saying offensive books are okay to keep on the shelf.  I'm saying that it should be truly inappropriate for it to be reported instead of it being over favorite books.  It should be one that almost everyone thinks is wrong for people to see.  Shouldn't things that are offensive be removed so that it can protect everyone, especially our children, from influence?  It's okay to not like a book or some music that someone else does. When that happens, you can just walk away and find your own favorites. But when there is something that does not need to be seen by anyone, we need to be the person that will remove it from the shelf to avoid having people finding it as something good to read.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do you think censorship in libraries is beneficial? I don't find it beneficial at all.  Some books, movies, movies, or magizine @MONTH1 be found offencive to one person.  This does not mean that the other people that visit the library would find it offenseive.  So it would not really be fair to take one's enjoyment away from them because one person found it to be offensive.      Katherine Paterson states, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf... And then we have no books lieft on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 that if she can take a book off the shelf of a library because she finds it offensive, then so can anyone else.  Leading to there not being any books left.  This would definitely not be beneficial to anyone.      Censorship in libraries should not be allowed.  It takes away some peoples entertainmeant, and the students resources.  If a student needed one of the books that had been removed from the self for a research project, what are they going to use?  This is what censorship in libraries does, it takes away and no benefits are gained.  So why have it?      Most people would be rather angry if someone was to come up to them and say 'I don't like that book, it offended me' and take the book out of thier hands and throw it away.  This is what it would be like, just not directly out of someones hands.  Maybe it was thier favorite book.  It would leave them with no entertainment.  That would be quite unfair.     Not only would it affect the people who read the books, but maybe even the people who make or write the books.  If a book is removed from a library or two, then it would mean that the company would have less places to distribute to, causing them to lose money.  It would also probably cut down on the sale of the book around that area.  Giving them less copies sold, loing them money.  This could also offend the author of the book.  If someone works hard to write and publish a book and have just one person getting offended by it, all thier work goes down the drain becuase no one that goes to that library can read it.      So what exactly would be the point of censorship? To comfort one man but take away anothers entertainment? To steal the resources of a student? Or to offend the author? Censorship in libraries is not a good thing. In no way could it be beneficial to anyone, besides to that one selfish person",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I do believe that offensive items should be removed from libraries shelves if they are found hurtful and or devastating.  Censoring those materials are great ideas, it allows you to read the story peacefully.  I've been in many occasions where I felt as if the book should have used a better word choice or not have written about that topic.  Also in many movies censorship could play a big roll, but instead you have to buy parental control and other ect.. to make sure what your family and friends watch and hear is apropritate.         I remember years ago I saw a documentry about the (@CAPS1)    or the @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  In this documentry repeatily these men use the '@CAPS4' word, I found offensive because here we have a film directed by a @CAPS2 guy with a @CAPS2 guy '@CAPS4' bashing and not once did the director tell him to use another word or anything.  now we have the opportunity to watch it, and order it from the library as opposed to a rap video being in stock. As offensive as it might be to me its not to the next guy.     I ask myself would i let my child read this book before i purchase.  Some wonder why does it matter; because those books you will check out or movies will get lost in somebody will find it hopefully not a child.  So just to be safe censor what you can and what you know absolutely needs to be censored.       I would say censorship could be useful to every one, it better the things the reader says in everyday life.  My personal modo is 'if you dont see it, hear it, then you won't use it.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"They are racist! They are bawdy! They are downright wrong for our children to be reading! These are possible statements parents could be saying about certain books being published and on the shelves in our libraries. Some of these parents also would want the possibility to censor the books their children have access to by simply taking them off the shelves. I believe that censoring books is a good idea to a certain extent. Books should be censored if, and only if, they are extremely offensive and innapropriate to the age of the readers.     There are some bad things that could come from this becoming a reality of course. Some peoples favorite books might be categorized as too innapropriate for it's readers, so that person cannot read it anymore. This is the part of the subject that can couse many problems between opposing sides of the arguement. Who decides where the cutoff point is for being taken off the shelves and staying? I think that if a book is so bad that it needs to be taken off the shelves, it will be very obvious.     One thing libraries can do to get around this problem is to create age limits on certain books. This way children cannot check out books that are too racy for them to be reading. They could also create 'adult sections' in the library that you must be at least eighteen years old to enter. This would help enforce the age limit on books so the children do not try to sneak the books out just to read them. Parents also can get involved if they feel the need. If they feel like their children shouldn't read books that might taint their minds, then they should talk to their children and tell them what they can and cannot read.     My opinion is that we should have each town or even each school elect a board of representatives that vote on which books should stay and which should go. This way, nobody has the right to complain that they didn't get a say in a certain book that got removed from the shelves. I also believe that children, or certain children, are old and mature enough to make their own decisions and read only books they feel is right for them to read at their age. Although some children are not mature enough to make these decisions, they shouldn't all be penalized.     So, not every 'average person,' as @PERSON1, an author states, has the right to remove books that they do not like, but they should have the right to at least give their @MONEY1 on the matter. Some books, some might say, are so offensive they have no right to be in the hands of adults let alone kids, while others believe that those books are the best books they have ever read. Because this matter is so contraversial, no one thing can solve this problem. The best thing a family or a parent can do, is to censor their own children until their town or school comes up with a system on how to ban certain books. I have read books that were, in my opinion, rated @CAPS1 ranging all the way up to rated @CAPS2, but none of them were bad enough to censor. Each person has their own opinion on what is good or bad, so they should censor the books in their own lives, not in everyone else's lives around them.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Certain materials such as, books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. can be found to be offensive. Material like those should not be read, heard, or seen, because it can start drama.I can relate to times in my life where i couldn't watch something or read soomething ,because I couldn't handle what they were saying. All in all, i think that they should remove anything that has wrongful meaning behind it.       I can relate to a time when a book or magazine brought me down because of what it said. I got done early with an assignment so I was shuffling through some magazines in class when i came across a newspaper saying that @ORGANIZATION1 isn't @CAPS1. That made me think about how ignorant people could be if they truly believe that, if he wasn't @CAPS1 than he wouldn't be president.      Also, if a material is talking bad about anyone of high power, or of an ethnic group that i think it shoud be banned. I was watching the news one day, and they were talking to someone about what they thought about @CAPS1 soldiers being in @LOCATION1, and he proposed that we just bomb it like we bombed @LOCATION2. I thought that wasn't right and that no one should say that on national television. It was rude and somewhat racist. I could only imagine how people that were from the middle east felt.      Just to think about young kids glancing over something that involves hate or discrimination is enough to make you wonder if they are doing anything to solve this promblem. I think that they should ban anything and everything that is contriversal.

2,"Today i write this essay to convince people to remove a few books and magizines off the shelves. Here are a few books and magizines that i have in mind. MAD @CAPS1, all fiction books, world record books, and expecially adult entertainment and all magazines and books that arent educational.           Theese items listed above are all for our entertainment. I think theese items are unessessary and should be forbidden for our younger viewers, adults and expecially our teens. even though there are many types of topics that have covered but there are some that should never exist.     Theese days our younger viewers are seeing and copying everything they see and read because they think its ok because other people are doing it, and to this day our teens are takeing actions for themselvs without even thinking about their actions or the consiquences first.      There are many actions that can be taken to for this to be successful. I feel that the whole @CAPS2 @CAPS3 should become more strict than we already are. Even though there are age limits for our books and magazines i feel people should be asked for their @CAPS4 if they dont have one than they cant rent or buy their product that they want.      By takeing theese actions I believe this will change the behaviors of out younger viewers if all of our reading materials were educational. Even our local schools contain unnessary reading materials in the library.Also i strongly euge our local schools to discontinue theese materials.     I strongly believe if theese actions are taken and if they are sucessful i honestly believe that our young readers will become more knowledgeable and more successful in the near future",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Books getting removed from shelves, that's censorship. And censorship can happen in libraies. Sometimes it's a good thing. But, most of the time, removing books from shelves isn't really a good thing.          An example of a book that has been removed from a libray is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It got banned becasue of witchcraft and wizardry. Now, I think that is kind of ridiculous. But, some people viewed that book was teaching kids the wrong thing and it was isn't right to let there kids be taught magic.           Another example of a book that got removed from shelves, this time in a school library, is @CAPS3. It got banned becasue of what went on the story. I understand why this book would get banned. This book is a little to much for young kids and I think it getting banned was a good thing.           If libraians were to remove all the offensive books in their libraies, there would be nothing left, but the information type books. But even then, some of those books could be offensive. And, there wouldn't be anything left. There'd probably be some books left, but overall, most books would be gone.      Music could get banned becasue of the singers, or the message it's putting out. Magazines could get banned becasue of what's on the cover. Also, movies could get banned because of what the movie has on it's cover or how it's rated. So, anything could get removed from a library by the littlest detail.      Censorship in a library, in a way, is kind of pointless. Only becuase, if the library doesn't have that book or magazine or movie or type of @CAPS4 someone wants, they can just go out and buy it. Then, the library could be loosing some business.

2,The books should be left on the shelf because they might not be offencive to other people. So if you think the book is offencive then put it back and dont read it. If you take all the books that are offencive then there might not be any left because alot of books are uncencerd.

2,"Should 'offensive' materials, such as books, movies, music,magazines, ect. Be taken off the shelf? My argument would be no. It is not that there offensive, it is the way people view them. What might be offensive to one person, might not be offensive to another. So therefore, people should read about the book before checking it out. If people are worried about there kids picking up an innapropriate book, they need to make sure they keep their child in the juvenile section. Which most libraries have now.           The term 'offensive' can be taken differently by anyone. You can run into offensive things anywhere. Why make such a big deal about a book in the library? People like to learn about different things, maybe different from what you are used to learning. So therefore, you might find what someone else is reading/learning about offensive, because it is not your style so much.           Parents always worry about their children seeing something before they are old enough, and even doing something. I can understand why some parents might be a little bit hazey when it comes to their children and the library, because no parent wants their child to see something before it is their time to learn about that certain thing. Like for instance, they could pick up a book about drugs and start to wonder about it, and either a) get curious about them more and want to try them. Or b) they could be the smart kid and refrain from them and go off of what they had read about the drugs being bad. This is a reason why I think all libraries should have a juvenile section, so we can avoid that problem.     There is always going to be something out there someone is going to find offensive. Whether it is a book, a poster, a movie, a type of music or song. People just need to learn to turn the other cheek and get over it, because there is more offensive things in than a book.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Libraries are wonderful places to seek out something that intrests you. Some visitors are very sensitive to what is placed at the library for others to view, and causes some corruption among the visitors. They @MONTH1 become offended by what is placed on the shelves, for everyone to decide their interests, which leads to them wanting to learn more about them. Everyone has their own opinion into what is offensive to them, or not. Even though, some @MONTH1 take offense to what is placed on the self, these materials shouldn't be removed, because of the select few who are taken offense of the certain materials.     Many of the materials are placed into different styles, genres, and age groups. Authors write in styles which showcases their skills for everyone to see. Different styles are created, for everyone to experience and discover their own interests. For instance, children love picture books. Picture books are a marvelous way for children to be entertained while being read to. These pictures also help tell the story. Therefore, children prefer picture books, rather than giant chapter books, from the adult section. @PERSON1 is a great example, for an author who is talented to write for children. His poems and pictures are a wonderful combination to enhance the reading of a young mind.     Another style of writing would be for young adults. This selection of the community, has a some-what developed mind. However, its still developing, still gaining insite. Authors choose to write about romances, adventure tales, and almost anything to grasp the teenager's mind. Grasping the teenager's mind, allows the author to tell a story along with teaching the reader an important life lesson. An example for this selection of people, would be any selection from @PERSON2, a young adult writer, who writes about how beauty comes from within, and how every girl should be treated like a princess, no matter what.     Then there's the adult minds. Adult minds are mostly already fully developed. They all have different opinions on which interests themselves, as a person. This should be taken into consideration, when the library decides to remove some of their selection. Authors should write in a more sophisticated way for this group of people. They are also very picky about what it is they are looking for, and what interests themselves as a person.      The removal of materials, which @MONTH1 be offensive to some people is not the brightest idea, for a library to do. Somethings are offensive to certain people, while it @MONTH1  not be offensive to another. Everyone has their own opinions, interests, likes, and dislikes. By removing these materials, which @MONTH1 cause offense, is a disgrace of the true value of intellect a certain indivial @MONTH1 possess.     Some things, @MONTH1 be needed for school, such as writing, project, and learning topics. These topics might interest the young mind, and they would like to learn more about this certain topic. Some older individuals @MONTH1 take some of the topics, their child or grandchild is learning, offensive but they should know that everyone has their own opinion.      Taking away certain materials, because of the offense of someone's own opinion is uncalled for. If all libraries removed anything that offended someone, they wouldn't have anything left to share with the community. Censorship is not needed in libraries. It is an awful way for them put into the position to descreat the idea that everyone has their own opinion on a certain topic.      With everyone possessing their own opinion, they can be very sensitive and take offense to the littlest of things. People are given the chance to learn something new, by visiting a library. If the library removed any material that slightly offended a single person, everyhthing would be terminated and no one would be able to learn something new. Censorship is not a necessity in a library. Any interest, opinion, topic are necessary for a mind to develop and think. They should be able to learn without anyone constantly telling them about what is offensive or not. Nothing should be removed from the libraries of the community, for a learning mind is a healthy mind. We need a place to learn more about a specific topic besides school.

Yes, some movies are violant and gory but we all know most movies like that are planned and fake. Some music such as, @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, they give positive meaning on life and about @CAPS3.

2,"Literature, the quest for knoweldge. Can selct forms of  knoweldge harm our youth? The @NUM1 century @LOCATION1 is constantly changing. A parent who once freely went to purchase an ice cream cone after school as a child will no longer allow their children to do the same. The hightened level of supervision is due to the changes in our society that are available to harm children. Libraries are being sought out as danger in a different form. The potential to harm our children through choice language and negative @CAPS9 content is all around them. Parents believe they  have a right to voice their opinion on protecting their children. However, children have to face the harsh fact of reality at some point in their lives.     An example of controversy is @PERSON1, a classic @CAPS1 writer. @PERSON1 has produced numerous @CAPS1 classic novels. However, the time period of @PERSON1's works dates back to a time where certain terms were socially normal. @PERSON1's work entitled '@CAPS3 @CAPS4,' has been questioned in recent journalism reports due to the use of a word associated in current culture as a derogatory term towards @CAPS5 @CAPS6. A parent's worst nightmare is to hear the use of such terms in their child's language. A child will eventually hear the word, if not through a novel such as @PERSON1's '@CAPS3 @CAPS4.' A parent's duty is to educate their children that such terms are not socially acceptable. Exposure to novels containing controversial language should be viewed as a tool to open conversations between parents and their children. Even though a child shouldn't be accessible to these novels until a certain age, an early opportunity is open to start creating a child's basis between what is right and what is wrong. Novels, such as @PERSON1's, should be kept on the shelves to help educate children on right and wrong, as well as @LOCATION1's past.     Books are not the only available materials at circulation desks. Libraries have grown to accomodate the advancing forms of information created in the @NUM2 and @NUM1 centuries. Thus, some libraries have changed their names to the term '@CAPS9 @CAPS10.' A child has access to books, music files, movies, and magazines at today's libraries. However, some materials in a library are intended for adults only. Until a certain age, a parent should guide their child through the library to help choose appropriate materials. A strong foundation of values and the child's intersts should guide the parent and child to choose materials in a library. The parent's responsibility is to help the child distinguish materials intended for their age range from materials intended for adults. Guidance in the early stages of development @MONTH1 help the child in their decision making process in the future. @CAPS9 related forms of information with questionable content should be left on shelves to help parents educate their children of what is appropriate for them. The materials should be left available, so when the child reaches adolescence, they can integrate adult forms of material into their lifestyle to prepare them for the real world.     Children are not the only issue to censorhip. Adults in the library community can be sensitive to select language and images as well. @CAPS9 companies, such as @CAPS11 @CAPS12, have made @CAPS9 forms accessible that block nudity and offensive language. An early adolescent @MONTH1 be able to view this type of @CAPS9 with their parent, as the @CAPS9 does not open the door into confusion and questions on a large scale. Adults @MONTH1 also choose to view this form of @CAPS9 over the non censored versions due to personal taste. However, materials with censorable content should still be made available to the people who would like to utilitze them. Libaries are funded through tax dollars, thus some citizens @MONTH1 feel libraries should serve the community as the community sees fit.     Censorship is a growing issue in this country, that the public must tackle at some point. If parents don't explain adult materials to their children during development, who will? @CAPS1 literature and @CAPS9 crucial to the education of our past must never be forgotten. Reality is growing upon us, and the public must find a new way to interpert reality for themselves, as well as their children.

2,"Censoring Books in the @CAPS1      Have you ever went into a local @CAPS1 and found a really interesting book or movie that @MONTH1 in some way offend someone else? Many people have done this, and a lot of the things that people @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 be something that should be censored so others wont feel uncomfortable. I think that the libraries should keep all things on the shelves, but when someone wants to check something out they should have to be responsible for anything some @MONTH1 say if they get offended at something they are reading, and everyone who gets offended should realize that most likely its not done on purpose. By doing this I think that people would eventually get use to the idea and it would become a second nature to people that visit the @CAPS1. If we actually try to do this good things could happen and bad things can be prevented.     Books are not the only thing that can offend someone there are many other things like music lyrics, art, book covers etc. When people go to check out different things in the @CAPS1 most likely they are not thinking that it would offend someone, it could just be something for recreational purposes.  I personally think that children should not be allowed to check something offensive to people out of the @CAPS1 unless a parent is giving there child permission.  I think this should be done because most likely when a child finds out that something they have is making someone angry, they will use it against that person almost every time. Almost anything brought from anywhere can offend someone and most people dont even know it because it is not done intentionally.     Some things that can easily offend someone are things that have to deal with religion, ethnicity, slavery, ku klux klan, powerful ones, presidents and many other things.  All these topics can be checked out at any @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 go to.  An example of this can be when a child in grade school or even an adult in college have an assignment on something to do with slavery and racism back in those days.  Most likely they will have to do research and check out books on these things to complete the assigned task; the @CAPS1,a great cash friendly place to go get the information, can be of a major assistance in providing them with anything that they @MONTH1 need to fulfill this task.  Now that they have their information they take there resources back to class and lets say an @CAPS2-@CAPS3 student gets offended at the cover of a book on slavery because it is showing a @CAPS4 person being abused; later a @CAPS5 gets offended because of a poem about how they treated blacks back in the days.  They apparently dont think those things should be in these books and thats a personal problem on their part because no one was looking to offend them.  Now everyone in the class is offended and causing chaos all over simple books allowed to exit the @CAPS1 with someone who had no intention of offending anyone. These books are of help to everyone, and most likely the people should know whats done on purpose or intentionally and when someone is simply completing an assignment or even reading just to learn more on the subject,they should know they have nothing to do with them.      It is not the libraries job to monitor who checks out what and why they want to read something and to be sure that all the books in there viscinity are not offensive to people because it is impossible to know the answer to all those questions.  The librarians do not have the time to make sure no one will get offended over something because they dont know how every single person feels about any certain item. Just like the example of the school assignment there would have been no way the person checking those books out would have known the class would get upset over something that occured many years ago and no longer taking place.  It is up to the ones reading these books and getting offended over things to straighten matters on their own. Eventually the problem would slowly go away if everyone works together.      To answer this statement honestly I say No I dont think the @CAPS1 should censor anything and they should not have remove any peice of literature of any sort from the shelves.  This is cleary a problem that the individuals themselves should be accountable to get over and realize the obvious fact that no one person is checking books out just to offend them as an individual. They are the ones having the problem so they should be the ones that have to work hard to not get offended over these small very minor occurances simply because someone is reading something that happened years ago. It is our job to fix this problem if we are the ones getting offended not the libraries",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"I believe that most of books,music,movies,magazines,etc.,can be removed because some of them just aren't right or need to be exposed to these young children.The movies that come out now that kids and teenagers go see or either very explicit or unrated for them to be seeing.It goes for all of the items I named because magazines explicit some of the music is explicit very vulnerable for young adults and kids minds in this generation.

My opinion is what @CAPS1 sticking with most magazines and movies and some music etc, should be removed.They just makin it worst for our future that we are trying to come in to or to be something in life.If nothing do get removed then thats just life I believe they want to remove them but their mostly in it for the money so thier not going to stop.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Alrighty then I really don't have a hole lot of experience with offensive stuff because well how to put this nicely, I don't care. If that offeneds you I'm truely sorry but I have reasons not to care. If something is offensive ok @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Back to my reasons I have a total @NUM1 reasons and one way we both can win a litle bit.      My first reason is simpal, if you think something is offensive then don't get @CAPS2. Let some one who might like @CAPS2 chek @CAPS2 out, buy @CAPS2, or whatever the options are. Not everyone shairs the same view on @CAPS2 whatever @CAPS2 is.      My second reason isn't as simpal as my last one, if some one is working one a paper and they are reserching something that was marked as OFFENSIVE then well they just lost a realy good reliabal resors didn't they. Now I'm not saying that evryone has done a paper on someting Offensive but some people have and more will, so make @CAPS2 easer on them ceep the offensive stuff.     Now my idea so everyone will shut up for once. Move all the 'offensive stuff' to another room. There you go no more problems. See now you don't have to wery about not having a book or a kid grabing a 'colorful' book every one is happy.     Alrighty then I hope this helps in the long run. I'm going to go take a nap now laters",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Don't take the books off the shelf, @CAPS1 people read different kind of books. To lean off of. If the book is bad, then have an age limit. That would help with the kids that get there hands on those kinds of books. @CAPS1 parents @MONTH1 want there kid to read thoes kinds of books. It all depends on how old the kid is.           If the book/magazines are that bad then take them off, but somepeople maybe asking for it. It's good to keep the reader happy, if libraries takes those kinds of books off, then those people @MONTH1 stop coming to that libaries. Soon they will go under and have to close. Keep books, magazines, etc.. on the shelf.          @CAPS1 of them @MONTH1 help parents talk to there kids. Then the kid will know how to be careful and not to get into anything bad. It all depends on the parents. But don't take those items off the shelf. It's importan to have them where the people can look, and lean, @CAPS2 quite and peaceful.           Most libraries don't take materials off the shelf, because it's importan for the people. Most kids don't like talking to there parents about things, so they @MONTH1 go to the libraries and lean there. It @MONTH1 also help them talk to there parents. If they try to get a movie, they would have to be atleast @NUM1 to beable to see they movie. So it will help them from seeing something they shouldn't.

2,"Libraries were made for the public; therefore, the public should be the ones deciding what should be in the libraries, right? I believe so. But should we exclude material from the library based on censorship? That's a different story.      Books, music, movies, and magazines all have to go through some sort of editing and publishing process to make sure the work is wholesome for its audience. That means that not every movie is made for a young audience, and not every book is made for an adult audience. That's what can make some materials not appopriate for younger audiences. Material with offensive language, violence, or ideas are the things people want to censor. But what if an adult wants to read a book with offensive language, but another mother censors the book for her child's sake and the book goes off the shelf? That's where censoring problems can start. Through my observations, I've found that everyone has different interests, and different ideas about what's 'good' or 'bad.' So how would we be able to censor things when everyone has different ideas? The truth is: we can't. The @CAPS1 tried to censor books in the @NUM1's, but even that has proven to destroy instead of conquer. It has to be up to the reader or their parents to decide, based on their age. Although I wish we could take materials off the shelf that give people bad ideas, or doesn't give them a good moral off the shelf like Katherine Paterson, but it would be almost impossible to do. But there are already great materials set in place to help us decide on a material in the library, and it's as easy as just using the internet. One thing we already have a great system for using is: ratings. Ratings help decide if something is appropriate for a certain audience. That doesn't mean it can't be found in a child's hands some way, but it gives adults a great standard to at least regard. Another way we have already censored is through reviews. If you want a certain book but you're not sure about whether or not it's appropriate, you can always go to the internet and read a review on it. It's the same for music, movies and more.      Based on my experience and observations, I've found that we should not try to censor materials in libraries anymore than we already have. Keeping certain materials in different areas of the library is already a great system set in place, and if we keep up with systems like that, I feel like that's a good place to be. Trying to take materials off the shelf for children's sake could make some adults upset that their favorite material is no longer there. So I don't believe we should remove any materails from libraries unless they are so vulgar that no one in society should ever see it, hear it, or read it. Censoring everything would end up just like @CAPS2's plan: in failure",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Do I belive that books need to be tooken off the shelf for having bad words in them, and above @NUM1. Yes I do belive that they need to be taken off shelf's at grade schools.

Kids now days are learning what stuff means just like that and you give them a book just like the ones that have cuz words in them, or over a @NUM1 one they are going to know what that means, And that is not a good thing at all.      I know ther is parents out there that they would strongly agree with me right now, and I am glad that they do. Because they do not want there kids reading that stuff, or even saying that stuff at home, or at school.            What I think the parents need to go to the school bored and talk to them and let them know what the kids are reading.

2,Books and movies and magazines are some kind of things you can find in a libary. But some people think that there are some of them are offensive.They think that they should be taken off the shelf.         From my own observations i think  people have a right in the community to choose there own stuff to read and watch. But I do think that the cds should be censored so there are no cruse words in them. Movies on the othere hand should be only for people who are in a certain age group. For instiance if you are ten and you want to get a @NUM1 movie I thing that the libary should say no and put the movie back.  If you are @NUM2 I think you should be able to get any movie you want that the libary has.     Books are a diffrent thing. Not all the libarys read all the books they put on the shelfs and they shouldnt have too.  Magazines are diffrent on my point of veiw. There should be two diffrent sections for magazines. One for the kids @NUM3 and older and the othere for younger kids. They also need to seprat all the books with unaproate languge and kids books. So that would help a lot of libarys out with there books and magazines.     I think that the censorship in libarys should be one movies and cds. Books are a whole another thing. What kids do you know at the age of @NUM4 picking a book with out piturs? I don't know any and I dont thing there will ever be any kids like that. So my oppinion is yes and no at the same time. Censor some stuff and not all of it.,3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"What would you call offensive? On the top of your head there's racism, bad language, sexual content, etc. But if you broke it down into what every single person thought was offensive the list would contain everything there is other than rainbows and nap time.     If people tried to censor a library all that would be left are a couple of books in the kiddy section.    Lets say a child went to the library and checked out a book about vampires and witches,who comes from a strict religous family, of course the parents are going to get upset. To them its offensive because such creatures are a slide against god. If we were to remove those books from the library, the kids who's parents didn't mind would take offense to just the action, and probably retaliate with removing all religeous pieces, and so on and so fourth. All and all not a good outcome for anybody.    People should keep in mind that most libraries already have systems in place. Such as sectioning off certain areas  like adults, teens, kids. and in those sorting the writing types.    We already have a good system. I see no need to start taking books off the shelf because someone else thought the material offensive. Not everyone thinks or feels the same. If you don't approve of a book and you don't want your child to check it out then monitor they're rentals, don't ruin it for the rest",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Is it wrong to take books,music,movies and magazines out of the libary? I believe it is because if it is to grafic for certain ages dont let them use it.     Music can be a very good tool in class projects. Such as doing a slide show and you get a song to express you point or add to it.You can do various thing with music then just enjoy it as a passtime. Kids could listen to music during there free time and help them relax or blow off some steam.     Books and Magazines are very bentifical to kids learning. Reading about something they enjoy can broaden there vocabulary and help them have a good passtime. They will choose there books and magazines they are interested in. Some books and magazines that questionable about being offensive should be booked marked and have to have parental permission to check that book out. This way the students that are mature enough to read these subjects will still be able to enjoy them without them being banded or taken out.     Movies are different for all mature or young ages. Movies can be very educational and a different way to learn rather than a book if it isn't to distracting for the viewers. Movies are great for kids that dont quiet get the book or cant follow the book. These films seem to catch there attetion and they watch and enjoy to learn about the subject more.     Books, Music,Movies and Magazines should remain in the libary. The more mature books should just be taken and put in a different section and have to have parental permision to look at or check them out.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do I think that books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shelf. No, I dont because you are still going to hear people swear and do different things that are not appropriate. So why take them off the shelf if they are not going to change people from doing or saying inappropriate things.     For example, when I was very young I started to learn right from wrong. But I also learned what a lot of wrong things was. Like when people swore I knew it was a sign of anger or in some cases it was just talking to your friends. I also knew when people got into fight that it was wrong but entertaining. My mom would always tell me you hear and see these things, but it doesnt mean you have to do it. With that I want to say you can read and listen to things that are inappropriate and offensive but you should @CAPS1 from the lessons you learned when you are little to not immatate.     In addition to that, if you take these books off the shelves, alot of teens and children might not read anymore books. These are the type of books that keep kids entertained. If you take them off the shelf, what are kids going to have to read. I @CAPS1 from personal experience these are the only type off books I read. I dont like reading books that are not interesting I rather read a book that I can relate to and that I won't want to fall asleep while reading.     Although, they might be write about books and music having a influence on them. They should still @CAPS1 right from wrong and not immatate what is in books or movies. Its not like the books or the movies are telling you to do these things. Kids choose to do them because they think it is cool or they think everybody else is doing this. Kids might even think that just because the rapper and actors are saying it then it must be right. But use your judgement, whats right and whats wrong to you.     In conclusion, I just want to finish off by saying dont take the books off the shelf. Let kids pick and choose what they want to read. Let them figure out if they are going to do the right thing or not. Don't be the judge of what they want to read. They will make the right choice.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship should be non-existent in libraries as well as society in general. It blocks out people's ideas and shields society from reality. Books, music, movies, and magazines were all written the way they were for a reason, to convey a message, and with censorship, that message becomes lost.     Censorship can be found everywhere. On @CAPS1, cuss words are bleeped out. In school libraries, books that portray offensive ideas, or contain thoughts and nature that are considered too complex or offensive for children are removed. On the radio, swear words are removed from songs. Some people believe that censorship is needed to protect people, children especially, from explicit content that they beilieve will harm them or influence bad behavior. However, what is really being blocked by censorship are people's ideas, and the reality that exists not only in today's world, but the relaities of the past as well. What's really being censored is the truth.          There is little doubt that the arguement of whether or not cenorship is benficial or detrimental will continue on for quite some time. Some people will remain adamant that censorship is essential to protect children, and promote good manners and behavior. This however, is clearly not the case as was discussed. As long as censorship continues in libraries and all throughout society, the truth and reality will remain locked away from children. It will be kept away from them until they become old enough to realize and undertand what's been hidden from them.What some can't come to realize, is that through censorship, progress is being hindered, and the truth is being covered with lies. What some people can't come to understand, is that by promoting censorship in libraries and society, they are truly just censoring themselves",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I believe that books, magazines,movies,music, etc., should not be taken off the shelves because some people might find them 'offensive'. Because that wouldn't be fare for the other people that might not find that kind of stuff offensive.                    Yeah, there might be stuff out there that might really be offensive to some but no one is telling them to read it, watch it, or listen to it. Now if there was somethings that were really offensive they wouldn't put it on the shelf in the first place.                For example, this lady rented the movie '@PERSON1' for her younger son and she watched it with him and the movie had blood and a nudity scene in it. The woman was mad and took back demanding her money back and for them to get rid of the movie. Well, first of all she should have got the boy the @CAPS1 version of '@PERSON1' where he can relate to it more because it's a cartoon, second, she should have read in the back of the box of what's in the movie and what it's rated instead of blaming the people who she rented it off of.     Not every book,movie,music, or magazine is bad or offensive. Some people just try to find something wrong with it so they can get attention off of it. Another example is the '@CAPS2'. This book has been around for thousands of years! People find it offensive because they say it's 'a lie, or there is no such thing as heaven or hell, or it's about a guy getting killed because his father loved us', if people carry a @CAPS2 on them because they want to it's ok for them to or if it's in the library, others freak out. If you are walking around with a @CAPS4 book and that person with the @CAPS2 does not find it offensive or if they don't care then you should'nt neither.           Parents, if you don't want your child to get anything bad, watch what they get! Get the movies or music for them, teach them right from wrong. Just don't blame the people that put it on the shelves at stores or libraries because they are only doing their jobs.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"When I was a child, I would walk through various rows of books until I found a book that best suited me. I enjoyed the thought of an adventure to find a good book. Wiping dusty books clean after pulling them off of a shelf. I loved the thought of traveling all over the world through the writings of different exciting authors. I beleive that books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from libraries. A library is a place where people of all ages can come and find something that interests them. Books affect people in different ways. They can teach a person about the history of civilizations or they can teach a person about the difference between right and wrong. They can change that person's life.     In my experiences, when I went to the library, I would check out any book I though appeasing and take it home. When I started reading books with super natural topics, I started to think outside the box. Books that allowed me to have an adventure could be considered offensive to sheltered people. The first time I picked up a book with monsters in it, I actually enjoyed reading. I started reading book after book. Even though these books could have been found strange or offensive, my vocabulary and need to learn grew quickly. If it wasn't for those books, I would never want to become an author to help inspire others to learn.     Books @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, but they also give knowledge to others. Just as reading about topics -like slavery- could offend or teach people about @CAPS1 history. Not only do books help expand a child's brain through building thought, but they give a child their own personality. People should be able to not only think for themselves, but to like certain topics.     Books with bad topics are also good for readers. When I was growing up, I would read stories on wars and other things with violent natures. With reading these stories, I discovered how people should act. I learned about the mistakes of people, so I wouldn't make the mistakes that happened years ago. I learned about how to treat others. I was taught, through reading, about not making the mistakes of others. With that, I learned obedience and kindness.      Music could be another topic of interest for the censorship in libraries. Music is a great way for people of all ages to connect to something. While listening to music, people get ideas for not only stories, but paintings and other career paths. Music is a place where people can feel they belong. There are so many genres, that people can find a sound that is appeasing to them. One person could relate to a song about growing up on a farm compared to a person that enjoys connecting to a song about the broken hearted.     In libraries, everyone should have the choice on what to read or to listen to. The ability to choose makes people who they are. It gives them a personality. With reading, people learn about histories. The reader can also learn about mistakes and help to correct them. Music, as well as stories, give people something to connect to. This allows people of all ages to belong somewhere.The different genres allow people to be themselves and to care about others",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Walking into a library, the librarians tell you to stay quiet and  to look throughout the library and find some books that intrest you.  If the library doesn't have the book or books you're looking for, they will ask if a neighboring library does.  So why do people say that material in the libraries can be offensive?  Because they look at what they enjoy and a book, a song, a magazine, or a movie that has a curse words and sexual scenes in it is not what they want to see, read, or hear.  Although some materials are found offensive in libraries, they should not be removed because people have the choice to read, listen, and watch what they want to.     All libraries are split into three main sections.  There's the children's section, the teenager's section, and the adult's section.  If a library has movies, then they are usually all together, but they are split up into ratings as well.  Usually people don't see a little child walking away with a stack of adult books, and teenagers might reflect on what they read when they were little, but they get tired of the repetition.  Every age group wants something new and that's why writers keep writing.  When a person gets to a certain age, they can graduate to a new set of books.  It's their choice to read what they want.     Someone is listening to a really good @CAPS1 that they got from the library.  They start dancing around and having a good time.  All of a sudden they hear this very offensive line in the song.  They realize all the songs have one line in them that is horrible.  So they take it back and never get it again.  It's the same way with a book, magazine, or movie.  If a person doesn't like it, then they can just take it back to the library.  It was free to check it out so they didn't waste their money on something new and find out that they didn't like it.  Libraries get new things in quite often so there has to be something everyone can enjoy.  If a person is offended by what they read, heard, or saw, then they can take the item back and never check it out again.  It's their choice.     Looking through all the genres of books get's kind of tiring.  However, if you know what you want, then that can make it easier.  A @CAPS2 person possibly would not want a book that talks about murder, drugs, sex, and other things like that.  That might offend them.  So if they really wanted something good, they should find a book that doesn't talk about those kind of things.  It might take some time to find something that they enjoy, but it's worth it if you can go tell your friends that these kinds of books are really good and they don't have bad things in them.  If a person gets offended by what they see or read, then switch the genres you're looking for.  It's really not that hard.     Libraries are supposed to have books, movies, magazines, and music that everyone can enjoy.  Just because someone doesn't like what they checked out, doesn't mean that everyone else agrees with that person.  If they aren't interested in anything the library has to offer, then they should just go write their own book, create their own movie, or make their own songs.  Libraries shouldn't have to take things out because people are offended.  The people should just look for things they are interested in and everyone will be happy.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In today's flourishing society, the media plays a huge role in the way we all view the world.  The media allows people to see through another person's eyes and understand their point of view.  Many people make and listen to music to help them deal with stress or just so that their voices don't go unheard.  Fictional books and movies draw men, women, and children into a new world and stretch their imaginations beyond measure.  For a moment, imagine if the freedoms of an artist were limited.  Take a second to think about what it would be like if we lived in a world where creativity was strongly discouraged.  Libraries are an outlet for many adults and children.  However, a library full of empty shelves is useless to everyone.     Censorship is the removal of offensive material.  Let's take a moment to define offensive.  Offensive is anything insulting or undersirable, right?  However, the opinion of what is offensive and what is not often varies.  So, does that mean that we should remove all materials from a library that @MONTH1 be considered offensive?  Absolutely not!  @PERSON1 said it best, 'and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The entire idea of censorship is biased and unconstitutional.      Writers jot down what's in their heads.  Journalist analyze what they see.  Musicians create melodies out of their experiences.  Actors potray roles that writers have envisioned for them.  Who should have the ability to completely remove the works of the innovative and creative people of this world?  According to the @ORGANIZATION1, no one does.  All @CAPS1 have rights which include freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  No man can take those rights away from another man.  Therefore, every individual should be allowed to let their abilities shine through without being censored.       As @CAPS1, we see censorship everyday such as bleeping out curse word on radio and television.  We live in a society where we are required to meet the status quo and always be politically correct.  This is a reasonable and sometimes necessary norm.  Consequently, for every norm there is always a rebel there to break it.  If it weren't for these revolutionary rebels we wouldn't live in the free nation that we are in today.  So, we must not silence their voices.  Instead, people must allow others to say, write, and do what they feel if it does not harm others.  Continual censorship and neglect of new ideas will only hurt everyone in the long run.  Imagine if @ORGANIZATION2's paintings were never seen because of censorship laws.  What if @ORGANIZATION3's writing was never read because they it was considered 'offensive'.  The media is oftentimes a device used for making history and no one should be allowed to stop that.     Instead of taking materials out of libraries that are 'offensive', leave them there.  Someone else might find them inspiring.  Do not request that something be censored for the sake of the children, just keep the children away from it.  Kids will only do what you allow them.  Be intelligent.  Think about how you would feel if someone told you that you couldn't be expressive or creative.  No change or innovation will ever come if we block our minds to the beauty happening around us.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Do you believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that they should be removed from the shelves if they are inappropriate for anyone of a certain age. I have read many books, listen to music, watched movies, and seen magazines that have inappropriate material in it and I know that children can get a hold of them. Many people say that they have the right to read, watch, or listen to any thing they want but young children can also. There are different reasons why some people want those kinds of material off the shelves.     One of the reasons why I believe that offensive material should be taken off the shelves is because many children that read or see the material will think that it is alright for them to do those things too. Many children and teens are doing things that will hurt or might even kill them, such as drugs and shoplifting. If the children see that it is alright to do these things because they read it in a book or saw it in a movie, will make the world a worse place to live. Children will do what they see and most of it is coming from movies or books that they found on the shelf at a store.     Another reason is that parents do not want there kids to hear or see what inappropriate of offensive things that are happening in books and in movies. Parents want there children to the right thing and not terrible things that they take off the shelf at a store. The parents also teach there children from saying things that are wrong but the children can't learn not to say them because they hear it or see it everyday. Many parents are protective of there children and don't want them to take the wrong path in life because of something they saw or heard of when they were younger.     Taking these offensive and inappropriate materials off the shelf can also help fix problems for adults. Adults hear or see something and automatically give their opinion on the situation. They see movies and television shows on killing and drugs that people get away with and they think that they can get away with it also. Seeings, hearing, or watching offensive things can cause problems by making fights among different people. One person might believe that it wasn't inappropriate and another might think it is and it causes more problems with it.     In my opinion I believe that inappropriate and offensive material should be taken off of the shelves. It will help children from seeing or hearing inappropriate things, make parents happy, and give adults a chance not to fight. Having seen and heard what I've heard I beleive it's the right thing to do. Taking this type of material off the shelf will make the world a less offensive place to live.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Censorship is something that fills our everyday lives. Some books and magazines are not meant for a little kid to read. This is why some books and magazines have been censored so that the little kids will not read the curse words. I believe that all people have the freedom to choose what is right for them and their family. Depending on if it is for or against censorship, that is the person's decision.       I think books in libraries that are found offensive should not be removed from the book shelves. This is because everyone has the right to read or listen to what they want. If a parent does not want their kids to read books that are offensive, they should help the kids pick out a book that is suitable for them to read. Authors also have the freedom to write a book what ever way they want to write it. People that really care about the problem should just learn to ignore it.     If parents do not want their kids reading certain books that @MONTH1 be offensive to other people or themselves, they should be looking for that. I believe that if parents truly care about what their kids are reading then they should realize exactly what the kids are reading. Music is also in our everyday lives. However, sometimes parents can not help what thier kids listen to, such as music. In this case I think all types of music should be censored on all radio stations. If the kids really want to hear all the curse words, they should have the right to go and buy the uncensored version of the songs.     I believe that all types of music, books, magazines, and movies that are in the pubilc, for public uses, should all be censored. If someone is at home reading a book I do not think it should have to be censored because this is the book that the person wanted to read. Authors should not be punished for how they want to write their own story. Everyone should have a choice to decide what they want for their family, and themselves. I have noticed that if we make our own decisions, we tend to do what is best for ourselves.",4.0,3.0,6.0

Everyone has the freedom and right to read, watch, and listen to what interests them.     There are many things in the world that people can control. Having to control the information or entertainment that is being put in libraries is a little over the top. Many books about religions and different views are displayed at the library. People @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree with the books being diplayed. Just because there @MONTH1 be a book or magazine in the library that @CAPS5 @MONTH1 not agree with, however, does not mean they have the right to get rid of it. Different people have different opinions and views on aspects of the world. If a person finds something offensive in the library they should be able to ignore it and move on. A @CAPS1 family @MONTH1 come into the library and want to read a book about their religion to enhance their knowledge on their faith. If a @CAPS2 librarian did not believe in that religion or think that @CAPS3 is wrong, they @MONTH1 want to take @CAPS1 books out of the library. If a person does not belive in something it does not necessarily mean that it is wrong.The reason why there are so many different books, magazines, songs, and movies, etc., in the world is because there are many different people in the world. Everyone has different morals, values, and beliefs. If variety was taken away in the world it would not be interesting.      Katherine Paterson said, '...But I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 @MONTH1 be able to take what they believe to be offensive off the shelf, but it would not be right. It @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but @MONTH1 not be to another who comes walking along looking for that book or magazine. Therefore, offensive movies, music, magazines, etc., should not have to be taken off the shelves of the libraries. The libraries would be boring and everyone would have to be interested in the same thing. The library would not be the place to come to be entertained anymore.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship in libraries is not a good idea. Children should read what they want. They need to develope a personal style. Would you want to be censored in what you read?      Therefore, If libraries took all the books that would be considered 'harmful' then there would not be enough books to consider it a library. Children need to develope their own sense of 'right and wrong'. There would be no religious text in a library, due to the fact that there are offensive material throughout. Fiction would have to be cleaned up, and what is the fun in that? Historical documents, they would have entirely to much violence.     Next, people make decisions all the time, children need to too. If a parent does not want his/her child to read a book, then they need to sit down and have a conversation about why the child should not read that book. Parents should let their children have a say in what they read. Parents do not need to inforce their ways of thinking on their child. Let the child decide for themselves. Reading is a healthy way of gaining knowledge.      Futhermore, if a book is concidered 'harmful' and taken out of a library, a child is not getting that chance to enjoy, or learn from that book. Knowledge is power, so do not take away a childs chance at gaining power. When a child reads, they absorb the life lessons and the adventures all these books have to offer. Some children @MONTH1 take a book and choose what to do later in life, whether that is a good or bad thing is up to them.      In conclusion, books should not be censored. It is wrong to take away a chance at knowledge for anyone. Children need to develope style, not be like everyone else. Reading is that chance to be different. Do not censore your children, let them live and learn.",3.0,3.0,4.0

Well, everyone is going to have a book that they don't like. If we were to let everyone take out the books that they don't like then we would have no more books and no more libraries.      One book that I have read that is controversial is ''To @CAPS5 A @CAPS6''. This book has to do with racism, rape, and the @ORGANIZATION1. Every person and or child should know about these things and how @CAPS7 delt with those issues at the time. If you took the book away we wouldn't have it to understand or learn from.       Another type of book would be like an instructional book. Instructional books teach us how to do something or know how to do it better. If they were to take these books away then we wouldn't be able to do certain things or teach other people how to do it.     Another source would be magazines.  Many people enjoy reading  magazines. Magazines are all different, and have certain things that people enjoy. Everyone has a different opinion on what they enjoy, and no one has the right to make that decision for the group as a whole.     This is why I believe that books should not be taken from libraries; for the content of the book, for the learning purposes and  so everyone can learn about histoy",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Should that book, movie, or @CAPS1 be removed from the shelf? I don't think they should be removed just because certain people don't like them. There are some people out there that like those kinds of romance or killing novels or movies. If this kind of thing is going to happen it needs to go through some sort of agreement or vote. I personally don't think they should be removed from the shelves.     If you don't want your kids to see that kind of thing then don't let them. It is that simple. You are in charge of what they can and can't look at and if you don't want them watching that kind of movie, reading that kind of book, or listening to that kind of music then you have to right to make sure it isn't in your kids life. There are some parents that don't mind if their child is exposed to that kind of stuff and to me that is there choice. Don't take the enjoyment from someone just because you don't like something that someone has done.     Also if you yourself doesn't want to have that kind of stuff in your life then you don't have to buy it or expose yourself to it either. You are an adult and you are in charge of yourself so you can make those decisions by yourself. Nobody is picking up the material and saying you have to buy this or you will go to jail. It is totally up to you. I don't see why things should  change just because some certain people don't like it. Once again you are in charge of yourself and if you choose not to like it then okay and if you do choose to like it then that is completely fine with me also.     A personal experience I have had with this kind of thing was when I was about @NUM1 and I was in the library. There was this adult that took a book up to the front counter and yelled and complained because her child had picked up a book that she thought was completely inappropriate for the child to have. This again comes back to what I was saying earlier, if you don't want your child to look at that kind of thing then you need to monitor what they are doing more closely and make sure that they don't look at it or try to to look at it. That is exactly what the librarian told the lady. I have always lived by this kind of thing and that is what I have told people who have problems with it.     I don't think that materials should be removed from the shelves because people don't like them. If people don't like it they don't have to buy it or look at it. If they don't want their kids to look at it or read it, then they shouldn't let their kids look at it or read it. These are some reasons I don't think books should be taken off the shelves because people think that they are inappropriate.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I disagree with removing some books, music, movies and magazines that are found offensive in a library. As a student, a library is a very helpful place to find resources. Books, music, movies and even magazines are wonderful resources to learn about the past or the present.     Libraries have a wide selection of books, music, movies and magazines that educate me and other students with history from the past. History is very important part of our lives because it awares us of past events that took place many years ago such as teaching us that @PERSON1 discovered the new world or finding vaccines for diseases or even that @PERSON2 was the @NUM1 @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1 that ended slavery.Removing part of that selection because it was found offensive wouldn't let us be aware of all the facts that history has to offer.      Books, music, movies and magazines don't only help educate students on the past but they also help educate students with the present. Today, they're are many things in @LOCATION2 that is changing such as @CAPS1 @CAPS3 being the first @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1. Not only is @LOCATION2 changing though, things all around the world are changing. With out books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be aware of the world and how it is changing.     Libraries also help me and other students study. With the wide selection the library has to offer I can easily find a book relating to my studies. With taking out some of the library's wide slection of books, music, movies, or magazines, I wouldn't be able to find one as easily.      If libraries were to remove some books, music, movies, and magazines that were found offensive we would be without some of the resources used today.

2,"Do you get offended easily? There are many offensive things anywhere you go.      I believe that if you get offended easily then dont read books or magazines that offend you. Libraries shouldn't take certain materials off their selves because most of that stuff intrests people and keeps them coming back for more. Costomers should know that there will be offensive material in libraries and if there is then don't read it. If libraries took all their 'offensive' material off their selves less people will probably return to that library.     When i read something offensive, it makes me want to prove that person wrong.  I learn from what i read and that's what people should do more often. They shouldn't make the libraries take that material off their selves just because they can't show the world that they are strong enough to handle it.     Libraries would be more interesting if they had a bigger varity, including 'offensive' material. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to a different person. Therefore, removing that material from the selves @MONTH1 make people mad because they don't get offended when they read it.     Be strong when you read offensive material. Learn from the material, show the world that you can hadle it, and try to prove them wrong. Libraries shouldn't have to take material off their selves if it might be offensive because it would make life less interesting.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Books, movies, music, and magazines come in many different shapes and forms.  Some are child friendly.  Many of them though, are not.  This is a problem becouse only movies and some music have criticts who talk about them.  Even if the movie or book sounds child friendly it @MONTH1 not be.      I love to read and watch movies.  Sometimes however I will read a book and it will be bad or unsutable for children.  This to me seems like a problem, becouse not all parents will tell their child that they cannot read the book or see the movie.  So this might seem like books, if not sutable for children, should not be in a book store or library.       I have seen my friends at the age of ten go to @CAPS1 rated movies.  I was never alowed to and I am glad my parents did not let me.  But it is their parents choice if they want their children to see the movie or read the bad book.  I do not think it is good but anyone can see it if their parents let them.     When i was younger i saw a @NUM1 movie and it was very raunchy and rude.  I was embaresed I saw it.  Then ten @CAPS2 later i learned my eleven year old cousin saw it.  I felt that was a bad a bad choice my aunt had, but she did not want him to be sheltered from the outside world.  She had her reason and it was a valid one at that.       I do not think that we should be alowed to take anyones right to see a movie away if they want to and they are alowed too.  If they do not think it is a good choice of movie for them to see then they wont see it.  If another man does than they should be alowed to see it.  Not all movies are a good choice for me to see.  Even when I am thirty some movies @MONTH1 still not be good for me to see.       If a mom does not care if her ten year old son viewes an @CAPS1 rated movie so be it.  They should not be allowed to remove books, movies, or anythiong else from shelves, becouse someone made that book to entertain you and they are hoping to make a living off of the book.  If we get rid of it they cannot make a living off of it.  Besides we have freedom to choose what we do and what we do not want to see.

Some parents think that there children should not be exposed to some things like violence and stuff because they will want to go and do bad thing because of what they see in the movie and what actors are doing and that is not entirely true. Yes there are some bad stuff in some movies, books, and magazines but maby children can learn from what they see in them. Also if parents will not let there children watch the movie they want to, or read the book they want to, then whos to say they wont go and do it with the parent not knowing about it. I would rather know what my child is doing and if they are going to read are watch something bad with violence then i would want to explane to them that it is very bad to do things like that and talk about it with them.     I think that if a child finds a book that looks intersting to them and they want to learn more about it then they should be able to because not alot of kids want to read in the first place. books can help teach children things and help them be better readers and understand things better.

Censorship in libraries break this right as well, @CAPS3 should contain materials for all ages, not only children go to these libraries to check out different forms of media.     Libraries should dived sections according to age and content in the material that can be checked out. Children should have an area with books, music, and films that are age appropriate, and they should not be allowed to check out things that don't fall into their age group.This can also be done with films and literature for older people who want to check things out from their library. Having an age divison in the library could take care of the worry of your children reading something you don't want them to.     Censorship in books and films should not be allowed in this free country were living in. Every person has the right to their ideas, and to put them out there for the public to read, or watch if they so choose. People should know what their getting into when picking up a novel or film just by looking at it. If you are offened by anything that the movie, or novel is portraying, don't read or watch it.

2,"In a world where we would all agree, no book would ever need to be taken off the shelf. With society now a days everyone has an opinion. Sometimes bad and sometimes good but there are three main reasons why I believe that no necessary steps need to taken to rid oursleves of materials like books, movies, and magazines such as personal opinions, education, and choices.      First, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. While you @MONTH1 find something offensive other people @MONTH1 not. Is it fair to everyone else that they @MONTH1 no longer enjoy something just because you didn't? I believe that if that was the case...the world would be very poor and we would have nothing. People should not base big decisions such as the removal of materials without taking into consideration how they make other people feel.     Second, something that almost all of us are recieveing now is an education. Thinking about those things you @MONTH1 like, what we should also be focusing on is how they are affecting our lives in a good way. Through experiences and knowledge we get a better understanding of life. This will also help us learn about situations and life in general. If we take those oppotunities away, we are losing those opportunities and we will not be as rich as kowledge as we would be with them.

2,"As the people of the @LOCATION1, we are granted several rights that no one or no law can ever take away from us. One of  those rights is freedom of speech. When it comes to the subject of censorship in libraries, I feel that this matter violates the right that was giving to us by our forefathers.     Censorship is already something that we see everyday. From the television that we watch to the music that we listen to, every part of the media world has a form of censorship in some sort of way. Personally, I feel that putting censor limits on things takes away from the orginality and creativity from the artist. The reason that a person writes a book, or creates a song is to express their feelings without someone telling them that it is not suitable for the listening public.     As a child, I always felt that the library was a place you could go to and learn anything you wanted anytime you wanted. For someone to judge if a certain book can be published or not be put on shelves is ridiculous to me. Its a clear solution to this problem however; if you don't like the subject matter of a book, don't pick it up! This also applies to movies,tv,and other visual entertainment. No one ever forced anyone to go see a movie that they had no interest viewing or felt was offensive.     When a company comes out with a product, each product is made to reach a certain demographic. It is unfair for a @NUM1 year old @ORGANIZATION1 official to censor a music video that was created to entertain a @NUM2 year old male. America has to stop being so defensive and scared of what the rest of the world @MONTH1 think, and let people express themselves however way they @MONTH1 choose.

Getting rid of these 'explicit' books would be getting rid of some of the worlds greatest books.     There really is no reason to get rid of explicit materials in libraries. Young adults and adults do not mind the foul language in these books and movies. They make them seem more realistic and up to date and it keeps them focused, if the character in a book or movie uses a curse word then they would know the person in the book or in the movie is being very serious.     Many people love reading books, different varieties too. Such as mystery, suspense, sports and, my favorite, crime investigations. If someone were being chased by a murderer, im sure the author would make it seem realistic and have the character running scared and screaming some curse words to get peoples attention to help them.     If explicit materials are becoming such a problem have the author rate the book, like they do with movies.

2,"Offensive or @CAPS1?     The library is a place where everyone can get reading materials that they desire. A topic that one person finds offensive @MONTH1 appear interesting to another person. A book that someone finds offensive is that person's @CAPS1. So if they are offended by the book, they can just not read it.     One topic that gets a lot of debate about is violonce, especially in movies. Some people hate violence and think it should not be in movies, and other people love violence. If a person thinks that a violent movie is offensive all they have to is walk away. Another topic that i can easily think of is sex. Parents do not want their children picking up and reading books about sex, but sex was popular in early english literature. People have many opinions and different styles. That is why there is many genres of books, movies, and music. A person should just worry about the genre they enjoy.     What is defined as offensive anyways? There are billions of people in the world and i guarantee all of them get offended in different ways. If we were to take down every single book that was offensive to anyone, we would not have any books in our library. It is a person's responsibillity to be mature enough to be able to read what they want and to leave the things that they don't want to read alone.     Not everyone has the same past. Different people in the world go through different events and different adversities than others. When people usually find something offensive it is because of something that happened to them in the past. A book about someone who committed suicide could be offensive to a person who knew someone who actually committed suicide, but to a person who doesn't know anyone who committed suicide would most likely not be offended by that book.     The library is for everybody. Just because some people are offended by a piece of work, does not mean that other people are not allowed to view it.

Well its their problem if their kids watch that kind of material.And another reason why people get upset about the movies they see and watch on tv, are because they see movies about slavery like when their family was treated horrible and they dont want that shown all over the world to people. Sometimes in movies it makes some people out to be someone they are not thats one reason i would agree with everyone that wants the movies and books gone. But their is nothing we can do about it. another thing people are upset is about the music their kids listen to like i said earlier if ya dont want your child seeing or listening to that keep them away from that kind of stuff and everything will be fine thats jus my opinon. So im sayin no they shouldnt be taken out of stores because thats the way of making money and im sure if some people had that chance they would do the same thing.      So here is my answer to your question about the situation that is going on with the drama about books, movies, magazines, etc that should be taken off of shelfs. so i say no they shouldnt be taken away.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I do believe that offensive books, movies, music, magazines, ects., should be removed from shelves. I also believe that they should not be removed completley though.     There are people who really enjoy going to the library, weather its just time to relax and have some alone time or to take your children there so they can pick out their favorite books. I think that having improper movies, books, music, magazines and so on should not be aloud to be on the shelves. Not for the fact that they are improper but because of the fact that children who are not of age are seeing and hearing these things when they should not be.     I think, to make it fair, they should have a seperate room for people of a certain age to be able to buy or purchace these items. That way the people are getting what they want and parents are not complaining about these unexceptable things for there children to see being on the shelves. Not only that but kids or teenager that might want to buy something out of this room and are not of age must be accomodated buy a parent or guardian.      If libraries decide to do this then i believe that people will be more happy and feel good about bringing there children to the library and not having to worry about what they @MONTH1 see or hear. And people who are buying these things wont have to worry about taking them off of the shelves because they are not suitable for younger or unexperienced children",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"No, i do not think they should be removed from the selves because if thats the kind of things we like then yes we should have a right to it. Should they be removed from the library and if they were you would have nothing left to read or to look at and to listen to. We all have our own opinion to things and some of us do like those things.      When we have nothing to do and we are in the library we mys well listen to music or be on cell phones or even read a newspaper or magaiznes. We like to do those things because it keeps us updated on the news and things. My suggestion is that we keep them in there unless they are really bad and and then you can take them away. But you dont have to get arid of all of them.      My expirence from this is if you dont like it dont have it in there but we will have nothing to do then",2.0,2.0,2.0
2,"Have you ever stopped and noticed the censorship in libraries and stores lately? Usually, you will find sections that ban young children from entering due to extreme content. In libraries, I believe that not everything should be kept from children and censored. I believe this because nowadays, everyone has their own opinion of how offensive something is, and just because a few people get offended, not everyone should be banned from viewing it.      One major reason that people think that certain content should be banned from libraries is because they are afraid that children will view or read it. Nowadays, children are much more mature, and can actually handle seeing extreme content. More and more children every day play violent video games and can function normally in society, so reading a graphic book, watching a graphic movie, or even listening to music should not effect them. Another reason that children can handle extreme content is that children are getting smarter, and they know that what is in a book, or a movie, is not reality. With this knowledge, they can easily handle these things and not be negatively affected by them.      Like I mentioned previously, everyone has their own opinion on how offensive something is. Some people get offended by how graphic a book or a movie is, while others might find that it is not inappropriate. Certain things in libraries should have an age restriction, because it is inappropriate, but it also should be up to the parent and the child if they are mature enough to view this content.      Parents should not try to block their children from viewing every thing. Just because a parent thinks something is too inappropriate for their child, does not mean it is. Parents should actually sit down with their children and talk about what they think is inappropriate and what is not. More then often, you will find that parents let their children play extremely violent video games, but will not let their child watch graphic movies.      Overall, I believe that not every thing should be censored away in libraries, and that it should be the parents, as well as the childs, decision if they are mature enough to view or read certain materials. Some people @MONTH1 get offended by the material, but it does not negatively effect everyone, therefor it should not be banned from everyone",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I can think of a few books that are on some of the shelves in libraries that I wouldn't want my child or someone elses child to take off the shelf. I do beleive that certain books, materials, magazines, movies, and more should be removed from shelves in libraries.      One reason certain books, and magazines, and other materials shouldn't be on library shelves is because they are inappropriate for children. Some adult books can easily be misplaced in the kids section. Children also go to the library and most kids want to stay with there parents. If the parents want to go look in the adult section there kids will want to go with them. They will see some of the inapropriate materials lying on the shelves. I am not saying get rid of all books just the inapropriate ones that shouldn't be revealed to childrens eyes as they walk with there mommy or daddy.     A way parents could prevent this is they could go with there child to the kids section and help them pick out a book to read and stay with them you could go another time maybe when you return your childs book to the library if they don't want to leave your side. A way libraries could change this issue is they could move all the inapropriate materials into another room or get rid of them all together those materials should't be in a library anyway.     I beleive that certain materials shouldn't be on shelves in a library because there are little eyes and little ears around that want to learn as well as others. Those inapropriate materials are not what I want my children or someone elses children to look at when they want to help mommy or daddy look for a book",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I think that censorship isant a bad idea to an extent. What im trying to say is yeah there should be somethings kept from little kids eyes till there older but you shouldnt completely band the adult materials from libraries,music,movies,magazines,etc.      The officals in charge of looking over the libraby and planning how it is set up should just make a section for that type of material to be placed and they should put an age limit on the area so that no one under such and such age can go in there. Yeah i can see why most parents would want to all around aliminate that certain material but then if you do you just mite end up having pattitions and everything else for one little thing your taking away from the public who has the right to see it.            The adult material in movies and music is again something the parents of the child has to watch and raise there child not to listen to. Those areas of censorship arnt so easy to take away because the producers and song writers will most likely fight you for trying to change there script and or lyrics. Along with the script writer and lyic writer you @MONTH1 just have to deal with the fans of whatever it is your trying to censorship. Which could cause alot of conflict for you and your company or buisness and im sure thats the last ting you want     Magazines are sometimes hard to censor to because alot of the advertizments in magazines are alcohal,ciggeretts,and clothings linews that @MONTH1 not be appealing to some parents that let ther child look at this material. But also you @MONTH1 have to think about the models in these magazines there just trying to make money like the rest of us there not forcing the children of today to look at there half naked bodys and or such material in the pictures in certain magazines      So all im saying is yeah in some was censorship can be placed on things but dont take the adult images away cause when todays youth gets older there going to be looking and seeing all these things you parents didnt let then see when they were little and there can be alot of problems with people censoring everythin",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"If we remove these items from are shelves what would we learn from this, that maybe there are some material suited for adults only.Then your taking alot of books off the shelves just because they have bad or affensive language in them. They just shouldnt throw out all the 'bad books', they should just cheak them out to only the mature readers insted of children.     When I was a boy going to the public library was a daily thing, we would get books,magaizines,and even book tapes. On one of our daily trips to the library I come arcoss this book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 two and it was a at a good price I might add, but when I when to cheak it out the librarian said'@CAPS3 child you are way to young to look at this book , i'll find you something better' then she hands me a copy of @ORGANIZATION1 (which at the times I was long done reading @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1).So @CAPS4 are children suppose to learn about history and important events when the libraries are taking out the most important books of all.     Alot of parents are blameing society for their childrens obessions towards teleivison and video games, but the fact of the matter is that involing your child in reading early will help him succed in the future.Parents, have you ever just thought about turning off the tv or not buying your kids that new video game, but maybe just getting them a new book or board game for the family but if thats the case make it so you know what your child is reading, just be there to help him/her pick out a book. Reading is the first step and never the last.           Some of the books in your local library you make this is garbage but i could also be another persons treasure. Because you @MONTH1 think the book is inapropiate doesnt mean that everyone thinks it is as well. but if you are uncertian about the book then just skim through it before you cheak it out, just know what your taking home. Libraries should keep the books that they have on their shelves where they are, they should just know whose buying them as well as if its reasonable age appriopte. But libraries should maybe do a better job on censoring their magaizines and music and that is mainly directed toward teenagers. So all and all quit sitting at home reading the newspaper and stop by your local library and grab a book, besides you never know what you @MONTH1 find",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"When it comes to censorship I believe that there is a fine line between controling and protecting. I also believe that, that fine line changes as we get older. While a parent or adult @MONTH1 @CAPS1 want a child to read about something grotestic or such, an adult @MONTH1 have every right to read what this said child is @CAPS1 allowed to read, but this decision has to be made by the guardian of this child or made by the adult who wishes to read this material. The library should @CAPS1 have the say in what is allowed to be shown to the public and what is offensive. They do @CAPS1 have the right to do so.     I believe that a libray is a source of knowledge for all things thinkable. This knowledge @MONTH1 @CAPS1 be all happy news and good, appropriate information. It never is. But that does @CAPS1 make it right for a library to pull some of the material they own from the shelves and @CAPS1 allow the public to have access to it. They do @CAPS1 posses the right to deteremine what a person can and cannot learn. We all have the right to an educaiton, by what ever means are avialable to us, including a public library. This knowledge could range from pictures or bloody battles or information about a decade where many different drugs were used. But no matter the extremes or innapropriate-ness of the subject, it's the history of our world. We should all have the public access to that.      There is a difference, however, between the access of a minor versus an adult. The adult, over the age of eighteen, is intitled to any access they wish. They control their own life, but a child, or a minor, does @CAPS1 yet have the responisbility to control their own access to whatever they wish. An adult guardian that is raising them has that control, but still @CAPS1 the library. The parent should be the censor for the minor. The parent knows what is good and is @CAPS1 good for their own child. They should be the ones that decide what the child can or cannot look at and learn. If a child picks a book off of the self and starts to read about some bloody, gorey battle and they learn some new cuss words or learn about violence, I automatically think, 'where were the parents while this was happening?' @CAPS1, 'how could the library have such innaporpriate information for anyone and everyone to read?' I do, however, understand the censorship of a child's reading section. I understand the want to remove innaporpriate reading material from a section where there are meant to be children's books. But again there is a presense of a fine line between over censorship and protection.      I believe that libraries should @CAPS1 have the power to take information off of the shelves. There should be an individual decision of whether or @CAPS1 some one is allowed to read or see something. the libraries should just put all the information out there for us to learn and allow the adults to make the decision of what the minors are or are @CAPS1 allowed to read or see",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Many people find books or articles offensive. They can be racist, sexist, or ideist. It does no matter. If you don't like it, then don't read it!     I have found myself reading articles that disagree with my morals, and ideas, what I do is I just scan over it and don't really get upset or anything. These articles can be very upsetting, but the more you let it get to you the more the author is happy. A main reason authors' write controversial articles is because it gives them publicity. People often over react to articles written from a very liberal or conservative point of view. These articles are meant to, the authors purpose was to gain notoriety from it.     These books however shouldn't be removed from shelves. If these books get removed how many and what types of books would be left. You might end up with libraries full of @PERSON1 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 novels. Libraries are meant for a community to go there and get books and newspapers that they haven't read yet. As soon as people start taking books out of libraries because of their content, that's the day when people no longer use libraries.      Now a days libraries are becoming obsolete to e-books and the kindle. So this means the people that get offended from noticing something on the cover of a book should for the most part end.       If the libraries decide to change their policy and start taking books off the shelf, then there needs to be some kind of list made to follow. The towns people of the town should figure this one out and maybe vote on it. It is their library and they are the ones reading the books.      If you ever find yourself looking in your library for a book of interest and see something offensive. Just skip over it and don't think anything of it",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Kenzie @CAPS1 @NUM1 @NUM2, @DATE1                                      @CAPS2 @CAPS3     If you went into a library trying to find stuff on a topic and there was absolutely nothing on that topic, wouldn't you be mad? I know I would and thats why I believe that censorship in public libraries is not right. The libraries are there for people to read and learn, and everyone is different and like and dislike different things. I do agree that some things in libraries are very inappropriate but that's why there are different rooms for adults, teens, and children.     I think that censorship in public libraries is wrong. People go to libraries to get information about something and if they go there and can not find something on their topic, they will probably be upset. I find that I can trust what a book says more then I can trust what the internet says because people can go and change what the websites say but people can't go through and change what a book says unless they retype it.     Katherine Paterson said 'If we all had the right of censorship then there would be no books left on the shelf for any of us', she was very right when she said that. I don't think that censorship would work out to well because people aren't always about doing the right thing. Someone could find an inappropriate book and take it off the shelf trying to be fair, but then there are other people who would take a book off the shelf just because they don't like it, and that's when it's wrong.     There is a lot of inappropriate material out there that should only be viewed be adults. If someone was to find an adult book in the children's section then yes that would be inappropriate but there are other ways to keep your child from seeing those things then just by taking that book off the shelf. That's why, in most libraries there are different rooms, of books, movies, ect., for different age groups. I think that having the different rooms doesn't just help with seperating the different age groups but it also helps you find what you're looking for faster.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong because a library is a place to come and learn, everyone likes and dislikes different things, and there are different ways of keeping inappropriate books out of younger people's hands.

2,"Offensive acts and language in books, newspaper, and magazines is a big problem face our community today. So many different races are joining each other and some people dont think before they act and that can be very offensive to some people. Reading newspapers, books, and magazines have became a daily activity for most city walkers. They are constantly reading the newspaper on there way to work. Some sit in the park and read magazines for hours. Offensive material needs to be taken seriously.     Music today has become more revolutionized in a way that all people sing about is vulger lyrics and inapropriate language. For example; rap artist, all they talk about now is having sex, taking drugs and getting money. Is that something you want your children to be listening to when they grow up? Parents need to make the right choice and keep control of what your children do. So many people are doing drugs and having sex because of the music they listen to. Vulger and disrespectful language needs to be taken seriously for your childrens health and safty.     People have been watching @CAPS1 sincer the first television was ever made. Color television was a very big improvement. But what are they doing about movies with '@CAPS2' rated material? In most movie theatres', they have a law that you must be seventeen years old to buy a ticket for '@CAPS2' rated movies. The only bad thing about that is, the seventeen year old can buy everybody else who is not seventeen, a ticket. Thats considered cheating the system.      People's @CAPS4 is a very popular @CAPS4 that everybody in the world reads. It keeps people up to date with all the celebrities and what they do in the real world instead of in the television. I see little kids all the time looking through those magazines, and some of them don't have the best material for children. They need to have a law that you have to be a specific age to buy some of the different types of magazines.     So in the end, material that is not appropriate for children and young viewers, needs to be taken seriously than it is today. Kids would not be doing some of the stuff they are doing today if there was some rules about listening to music, watching @CAPS1, and reading books and magazines.

2,"Dear Newspaper,     The removal of books, music, movies, or magizines from shelves is unacceptable. It is a problem occuring across the country. Our nation was founded on the principles of freedom of speech and press.  No one should be allowed to take away a book from someone just because they think it is offensive. It is unfair to the people that wrote them and to the people that have not expierenced them.     In my expierence I have only come across a few books that have been offensive to me, but have I asked the libary or bookstore to take them off their selves? Absolutly not! It is unacceptable that one person can just take down a book the only person that should prevent you from reading a book, watching amovie, listen to music, or read a magazine are your parents. Sometimes even your parents should not be allowed to take away that expierence from you. Things should not be hidden from people because they will be found and when they are they will be even more offensive because the people have not expierenced it before.     Almost any book, song, magazine, or movie can come across as offensive to someone and if every person decided to take that book down from the shelf 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (@PERSON1). It is unfair to the people who have not read or expierenced that book, movie, or song etc. for some one to pull it off the shelf because someone that hasn't read that book could love it. It is also unfair to the author, director, or conductor who created the book etc. for it to be pulled off the shelves. Although some books are meant to be offensive, most are not and just because one person or a group of people think that it is offensive doesn't meen it actually is.      There should be no cenorship concerning what goes on the shelves in our public libraries. It is unfair to the people that wrote them and the people that have not expierenced them.

2,"Content featured in a library should not be taken lightly because of the words or the message that it presents.  Everything from Books, music, movies, magazines, videogames, art, and others can convey a message when the viewer sees it, wether it be positive or negative.  The creature of said content has that right to make it, and no one should strip him of that right.  however, it seems that libraries across the world are banning that content because they personally find it offensive.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc should not be removed because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the man/woman who created the content, and the fact that the banning or censoring itself is judged on one's opinion with the library itself than rather the general public's opinion.     The first amendment was created as a way to ensure that everyone has that right to have a voice.  Wether it be speech, religion, press, or actions of an individual; no one has the obligation to go against it.  The fact that the libraries can ban or censor the content in their facilities is against the first amendment because they are implying that you have no rights when your content is being viewed in the general public.  This action to neglect the first amendment can lead to other acts such as: protest, book burning, anarchy, etc. is not only an overall visual on how blinded people can be when a topic they do not agree with can affect them, but how they can easily neglect the hard work and thoughts our forefathers put in to make the @CAPS1.  Censorship of lyrics, movies, and magazines are another act against the @CAPS1.  One of the reasons why ratings systems are on these items is to warn the reader, but to also protect the creator's first amendment rights.  The first amendment gives authors and creators more freedom to write their stories uninterrupted with safeguards, and to lock their chances of having their voices heard is, well...an insult.     Take for instance, @CAPS2 @NUM1.  The book's author (who for the sake of this essay shall not be named.) had his material stripped from library shelves and burned to the ground.  He expressed how insulted he was, how badly misinterpereted the book was, and was overalled appaled by their ignorance.  This begins a new reason why books should not be banned or censored from libraries: insulting the author.  Multiple books such as @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7, the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 code, even religious texts such as the bible and the korran are banned from libraries because of their accused 'offensive' nature the books poseess.  The authors are insulted and hurt that they put a lot of effort into creating an engrossing and open minded world for the reader, only to be shot down by the libraries dictatory ruling on their content.  It can also lead to the libraries sense of poor morals being contradictory to the content they have not decided to ban.  Which leads to this: why is the libraries' opinion more powerful?     Now before the next reason is discussed, it is acknwoledged that the Libraries have that right to ban materials because it is their facility that they pay for; but the process that they undergo to confirm a banned book is rather opinionated within the library itself. Libraries should not ban or censor materials based on their own opinion because it resonates a biased tone that the libraries poesses.  The judgement on a book is settled between that said library and multiple libraries across the district.  Granted, some libraries will agree that it should not be banned or censored, but it will all lead to majority vote.  Instead, that decision should be discussed between schools, communites, councils, etc. so that way a more outspoken voice can support or deny the material.  It doesnt ensure that the book will not be banned, but at least a general voice will be more sufficent than a concealed voice.     Libraries should not have the right to ban or censor materials contained in the libraries because it goes against the first amendment, it is an insult to the author or creator of the material, and the banning or censoring is judged with the libraries opinion than rather the general public's opinion.  This is an ongoing topic that is still being discussed today, and will most likely be ongoing in the future.

2,"Dear news paper company,     I think that everything should be put on the shelves, but have age restriction if @CAPS3 is that bad. I think that if @CAPS3 is published, @CAPS3 should be aloud or else there would be no reason to have @CAPS3 published.         I can understand where the society would come from by saying that @CAPS3 should'nt be there because of the fact of young children wondering around looking for something. I can understand that there should be things young children should not see.     My answer to solve this problem is, either make a separate room that only a certain age can go in or, just have a restricted section in the same room that kids cant see.         Now, the only thing about having @CAPS3 visible where kids could see is if some places had porn as an option to choose from, then that would defiantly need an age restriction and a separate room.    For instance, my local movie rental store, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, has a separate room that has an age retriction on @CAPS3 because that is where they keep the porn. You have to be @NUM1 and older to enter.     Another experience I have witnessed in the past was my middle school, @ORGANIZATION1, in their library they had a restriction section that we could not go in for books. The only people who could look at those was eighth graders. They had options like @PERSON1, @CAPS3.     The reason this book was in the restricted section, like the rest of the books, @CAPS3 was meant to be a scary book. @CAPS3 was the book that every eighth grader wanted to read. Every sixth and seventh grader was anxious, whether @CAPS3 be the reason of being aloud to be there or just wanting to read the book, they were anxious.     Thank you for reading my letter and my opinion on letting anything be on the shelves. I hope you take into suggestion that you post this so that local libraries, movie rental areas, and stores can see that @CAPS3 is ok to put things up as long as some things have age restrictions. Once more thank you for taking time out of your day and reading my letter of concern.                                       Sincerely,                                     @LOCATION1",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship is a good thing in many ways, but it does have it's flaws. In libraries the books are usually sorted by the type of genre they fall into. For this I am not so sure that censoring a libraries' books' will really accomplish anything other than wipe out a whole shelve. The idea of censorship is meant to keep kids under a certain age from seeing many things that even adults today don't like to see.      We should not waste the time or man-power that is required to make a library censored, because if a kid wants a book that is no longer available at the library they can always find it to read free on the internet. All that censoring a library would do is make it a little harder to find a certain book. Also, the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, gives us the power of free @CAPS3, isn't the whole censorship idea covering that up to us?     A better way to censor the library would be to but all of the books that are questionable into a section that means an adult has to be with kids to check them out. This way you are not interfering with the free @CAPS3, and you can censor what is being read by children.     I beleive that libraries' should not be censored. It is to hard to keep kids from finding those things anyway. It would be a waste of money and man power to go through each and every book making sure nothing that is inappropriate is in them, especially if the kids can still find the whole book on the internet. Also, I feel that censorship is blocking one of the ideas that created our nation, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 of the @CAPS5.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Books shoudn't be removed because they are too offensive to someone. Books should just be marked or rated. More mature books should be rated or marked different then other books that are not as bad. An author shouldn't have his/her book taken off the shelf just because a reader found it to be too much for them.           Movies have a rating and only certain age groups are allowed to see certain movies. It works well and i personally believe that it should be like this for book, magazines, and other materials. If books and magazines were marked and only certain age groups were allowed to read them i think it would work well. Before getting a book the reader should check into it to find out what they will be reading about. If they think that the book or magazine will be offensive they shouldn't get that book or magazine.      I believe that censorship is a problem in libraries and that rating or marking a book by its contents will be a great way to solve the problem. Older and more mature people should get to read the books that are more violent, sexual, and intense books. Younger kids should get the books that are for their level of reading.      Books, magazines, movies, and other materials should not be removed from shelves because they are found to be too offensive. Books and magazines should be marked or rated so that people will know what kind of book they are getting. Older more mature adults and teenagers should be aloud to read the more offensive, violent, sexual, and intense books. Younger kids should get the books that are set for their age. I believe that making a rating or marking system would help solve the problem of censorship.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries and censorship? My opinion on this matter, is that libraries should not use cesorship. Everyone gets offended by something different. I don't see why someone would come up with the idea to censor libraries. Most libraries in @LOCATION1 don't have harmful or offensive books, magazines, movies, music, etc.     If you want to read a book that is offensive, then make the choice to read it. Make your own choice, don't let others choose for you. If your under eight-teen then clearly you can't check out and adult book. If you can't make your own decisions, then talk with a parent or gaurdian about it. If libraries used censorship, there would be no books, magazines, movies, etc. for us to enjoy. What's the point of having a library if it has no books? I'll answer that for you. There is no point!      Libraries carry a variety of books, magazines, movies, and music for a reason. That reason is business. Most libraries carry popular books, magazines, movies, etc., that someone could think is offensive. Thats why most libraries have thier items in different sections. If your not eight-teen then stay out of the adult section unless you have permission. It's not rocket science! If a bad book ends up in the kid's section, just tell the librarian about it. Let them handle it, it's their job. If the librarian cares for thier business, then hopefully they will move the book to where it's suppost to be. That is how you will prevent these accidents from happening.     Censorship would ruin a place like a library. If everyone got what they wanted, there would be no books, movies, music, magazines, etc. Theres some things in life you just got to let go. Censorship in libraries is one of those things. We are talking about a library here people. Let people express their self by letting them read what they want to read! If you want a library that has no offensive or harmful items, then go build it your self. Thats my opinion on censorship in libraries.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In the united states there are alot of book stores, librarys and other stores with most of the same things kept inside them. There are alot of things in our library that are offensive, nudity, laungauge, and all sorts of different types of things. But I do not think any books or any other material should be taken off the shelves if there offensive.  Just because there is somthing that somone doesn't like doesn't mean that they should get rid of it because other people might want it.  If there is somthing offensive in a library or wherever it might be then those people should just look at somthing in a different section and not worry about it.  If it really starts to bother them then they need to go to a different library.  Although i do think some book stores should have a private room or atleast sighns telling that there is material in a certain isle that you need to be a certain age to see or that it is rated @CAPS1.  But i think all books, movies, mags, and media need to stay on the shelves some @MONTH1 be very educational, even though it @MONTH1 be very innapropriat at the same time.",3.0,3.0,4.0

Wheather it be about a sports team or something personal. I also think children should have a limit on what they can and can't check out of the @CAPS4.     First I think that books and magazines should really be looked over and see whats appropriate for kids, espically magazines. I'm not a big reader and don't go into libraries alot but I have seen some pretty graphic magazines that little kids look at. If I was a parent I know for a fact I wouldn't want my kids to look at some of the stuff they have in them. I think the books arn't such a big deal as the magazines because not as many kids want to read an adult book they would rather read a kids book.     Next I think that music should also have a limit. I'm a country music fan but i've heard some of the other stuff and almost all of it has bad language in it. Alot of people like that music but there's alot that find all the language in it to be offensive, like my grandma. I think to, that kids hear it too much and then eventually they start talking like that.     Lastly I think that movies can be the worst of all. Kids I think should definitly have a limit to what they can and can't check out of the @CAPS4. I don't think they should remove everything from the shelves but kids should be limited to what they check out. Many kids get exposed to bad stuff at a very young age through movies.     Alot of people have different views on things but I think all of us have read books or magazines, watched movies, or listend to music that has offened us at some point.

2,"Cencorship in libraries; good or bad? Yes or no? People all over the world have different opinions; so why should we be forced to read the same type of books? Just because someone is offended by something that they came acrossed in a book does not mean that the person next to them will be. The library is open to all ages and a fifteen year old girl is not going to be interested in the same book as a ten year old boy. Don't forget that there are also many choices and a wide variety of books to choose from. Before you make up your mind about cencorship in libraries think about the downfall of it.     Every @DATE1 some people go to church and some stay home, not every person in the world share the same beliefs. It is exactly the same with what type of book you want to read. Teenagers seem to like love stories or books that involve the impossible, while kids love picture books, and adults like stories about crime and mystery. There are books in the library that will satisfy all of our needs we just need to look in the right spot. Cencoring the libraries because one person found a comment in a book that offended them is unnecessary. Just because they believe in that certainly does not mean their neighbor does and that is something you have to take into account.     When you were a kid you read picture books and in the library you went straight back to the kids section. If there was a book your mother did not approve of she would not let you get it, but she wouldn't make them take it out of the library. So why should they start now? If you are not interested in that particular book than put it back and get another one, there is no need to make a bigger deal out of the situation. Remember that the library is used for all ages and we all have different type of books we like to read.     The library is full of books of all kind. Im positive there are books in there just for you. Say you check out a book and it offends you because it goes against everything you believe in, then take the book back and check out another one. Instead of throwing a fit and demanding that the library take the book out just simply return it and go pick out a new one. It's as easy as that and next time just be sure to read a few pages into it to decide whether or not the book is for you.     Cencoring the library is not a need and can be avoided. Teach the kids at a young age how to check out a book and make sure they know they like that book. You can not change your beliefs, but you can choose the things you do around them. Every book has a summary on it, read that first and if the book appeals to you then read the first couple pages. This way there is no need to have cencoring in libraries if you are big enough to go to the library by yourself then you are big enough to know what books are appropriate for you.",3.0,3.0,4.0

I also think that if stuff is graphic you they should have a age limit on @CAPS3, doesn't mean you have to take @CAPS3 all the way off the shelf!     A book is kind of the same as a movie. They have a lot of offensive movies that people shouldn't see, but that doesnt mean they take @CAPS3 off the shelf they just put a age limit on @CAPS3. I think @CAPS3 should be the same way for a book.     Like the artical said if everybody that thought a book was offensive and and took @CAPS3 off the shelf. Then there wouldn't be any books left. Everybody is titled to there own opinion. what they think is offansive might not be offensive to that other person. Thats just what they think.

2,"I beleive that it is up to the parents to make the desicion if it is appropriate for there chilren to view. I think that parents should be viewing what there kinds are viewing and making sure it is appropriate for them to watch. At the same time the kids should be mature enough to decide if the material they are viewing is apporpiate for them.     The library should be setting up a rating scale like what they would have on any video game, television show, or movie. When I was younger there wasnt such a big emphasis on material kids were viewing. but now that times have changed things need to change as well. Since kids should be aware of what there watching, I belive that a rating scale would be a good rule set into place. With a library card they can set up an I.D. system to tell how old the kids are and with that knowledge the librarian can make sure the book the kid is checking out is age appropriate for them.     If the matrial the kids are viewing is too inappproriate the kids are going to be under the impression that it is ok to commit these acts and they @MONTH1 go off and do things such as drwing on the walls, stealing cars, robbing banks, bullying, and overall inappropiate behavior. For example: If little @NUM1 year old @CAPS1 decides to read read a book titled '@CAPS2 of @CAPS3' it @MONTH1 be too mature for him and if it @MONTH1 have material inside the book that will cause him to think that the stuff inside the book is ok in society. and will grow up thinking that that kind of behavior is @CAPS4.K.     Kids should have a say in this since this is about them. They should be mature enough to make the decision if it is @CAPS4.K. for them to view that kind of material. With age come responsibility thats what they should be being told. The parents should be telling there kids that some material is just not age appropriate and they can't view it untill they are older.     This is my say in this debate. Like I said before parents should make sure the material there kids are viewing is appropriate, and the library should be doing something about this issue to. Along with that the kinds should have a say and be mature enough to make the desicion if it is age appropiate for themselves.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do I think offensive books be removed from the libraries? No, I think not. Books have many different uses. They present history from differnt centuries all around the world. They take people on adventures though imaginary lands. They give the freedom to express themselfs. Books can even be used to change peoples emotions with a single word. If we removed every book that someone had a problem with, their wouldn't be any books left!     Before people wrote anything down, humans where in prehistory. Before history. Because people have taken the time to record their past, we can get an idea of what life was like for them. Someone said that history repeats itself. If there where no books or writings, history could be forgotten and mistakes we forgot about could happen again and again. Since we have books, we can be saved from this deadly ongoing cycle. We need books. They remind us who we are, but books not only do that, but much, much more.     Talented writers can create an entire world in their head, and put it on paper. They can take people though the darkes caves, dive into the deepes part of the ocean, and explore the farthest corners of deeps space. With books you can go where ever you want and the only thing you have to do is turn the page. The freedom books give people, should never be taken away from an individual.      Individualy everyone is different. We all have different apperinces, different interest, dislikes, and different opionions. Books give people the frreedom to express themselfs. Not one person on the face of this @LOCATION1 is exactly the same. Since everyone is unique we all view the would from different perspectives. No one is going to agree with every last thing. Perfect example of this are books. Someone could write a book and someone else might not like it. If that book was taken off the shelf, then it would be only a matter of time till more books followed.     I understand that not every book can or will be kept on the shelfs, but people can't just go have a book in the trash party! For it to work there has to be balance. I believe it's true what Katherine Paterson has to say, because if book removing gets out of hand their would be no litature left! People need books and other materials to express themselfs, to learn, and to have the freedom to express themselfs. Go read a history book, if you take their freedom away, you know what will happen.

2,"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 are millions and millions of movies, books, magazines, and songs out in the world today. Everyone being different in the world, will have different opinions on what they think should be appropriate to view and what should not be. Everyone has different taste and they way that they view certain things.          I think movies have done a good job on classing the movies for certain age groups to see and what not to see. Magazines and books are not grouped as well as movies are these days. They are not too far behind tho. @CAPS1 is magazines out today called @CAPS2 @NUM1, telling the audience that the reader of this magazine should be in the area of age @NUM1. But, not like movies if someone under the age wanted to buy this, they would not be stopped.           I do not think you should be able to remove a certain source of information based on because, you do not like it. I think if @CAPS1 is a certain book, movie, magazine out that creates a group of people upset than they should be able to get that source of information looked over buy a higher source. In most cases if the source of information is inappropriate than they will mark it as an adult audience only. In my opinion that is a really good way to handle the conflict because, in stores they have a certain section where only adults can enter.            I also think if an author or director comes out with a really bad book, movie, or bad magazine than @CAPS1 should be a group that could have the capability of removing that book, movie or magazine. Once again, it could not be one or a couple of people upset with the source of info. It would have to be a rather large group of people. The reason it having to be a rather large group so, that it would prove that maybe this book, movie, or magazine does have a wrong image on the people out @CAPS1. A little group of people not liking the source of information would not prove much other than that certain group does believe or see the way alot of others do.           In certain cases I do believe that a book, movie, or magazine could be removed from shelves but, in most cases I do not. @CAPS1 will be books, movies, or magazines out @CAPS1 that will sometimes need to be removed but, I do not think this will happen very much.

One of the ways I would deal with this is by taking all the things that are not for children and put it high so the kids wouldn't be able to reach. Like the way partens do at home with their own kids when they don't what the kids to get or touch something. Another reason is because there already is a kids area. Also moving things around in the libaray isn't that big of a deal it might be a lot of work, but if you really do want to keep the adulat book at the library I think it would be worth it.

2,"Fahrenheit @NUM1 is a novel that is considered by many people to be a great classic. As a freshman at my high school I was required to read it. This book is about the 'future' and what it @MONTH1 hold for us. The author of this book predicted a future where people have lost touch with the real value of life and each other. This mainly comes from people being too absorbed in the newest tech devices to the point where a husband barely knows his own wife. Also in this novel, it is a crime to read or have any works of literature. Any books found are burned. When questioning whether to ban certain books or not, it is important to keep in mind this story, where things were taken too far.      There is a certain value to be had in the stories and novels that we read, a value that can't be replaced by anything else. There is much information to be found in books and much that can be learned. I don't believe our society will get to the point where it is a crime to read or where books are burned but, at the same time, there are certain offensive matterials that shouldn't be available to the public.     In our history books have already been banned. For example, @CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3, a book about the truth of slavery, was outlawed in @LOCATION1. The reason it was banned was mainly because people who supported slavery didn't want a story about the ugly truth of it to get out. What if this were to happen today? What if there was a book that told a certain truth about our country that most people were oblivious to and it was banned? It isn't the material like this that should be banned, in fact, these are the types of books society needs to read.      In the @LOCATION2, we are blessed to be able to have almost any book we want to read at our easy access. Libraries our helpful in many ways for both research information or a book for enjoyment; however, there are books, magazines, music, and movies that really shouldn't be at our disposal. For example, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is an inappropriate magazine that shouldn't be available in a library where young kids can see it. Similarily, there are music and movies that are inappropriate as well. There is a saying 'garbage in, garbage out' meaning even the smallest intake of any of these can cause a person to turn it right back around and start spreading it. Is this really what we want in our society?     At the same that we are @LOCATION2 citizens with the right to read, see, listen to, or say whatever we please, there is also a point where we should control what we do make available in our country. A parent shouldn't have to worry about bringing their kid to the library and worrying about what he or she might come across.

2,"Our libraries should not have censorship on books that are offensive. For one, why would he or she choose the book if he or she has a problem with it. Just cause somebody does not like the book or has a problem with it does not mean it should be removed. I myself would if a book I find interesting gets censored just cause someone thought is was offensive, @CAPS1 I think it is wrong considering the fact that they do not or have not even read the particular book.     I can get the idea that people want to censor or even get rid of the books cause it is offensive to them. Why should hundreds even thousands of kids get thier desires thrown away over a kids problem? Why should kids be restricted from learning something that they have never heard of before? Why should that particular person get thier way over everyone else? This is nt fair for others to be cut off from learning just cause something was offensive. Example being; I want to learn about the @CAPS2 and the book I have been wanting to read gets removed just cause somebody saw the book and they did not like it. If that event would happen to me I would become enraged, so then possibly I might want to do the same thing that happened to me back to that person.     Dislikes of books can lead to a serious problem especially if others were to repeat the process to others just cause someone had done it to them. Coming from the event of people causing books to be censored and removed could cause there to actually be no books in libraries anymore. The problem with there being no books is that it would be harder to learn without them or even do things like homework or just to read the books out of interest. Why would someone think of this as a benefit? Why would someone think that it is a good idea to stop a book from being read? I just do not understand why someone thinks that they are so special over everyone else they can get their way.     First thing I got to say is who in the world would come up with this idea that can cause others not being able to learn. I would like say say how would this make you feel and even famalies feel. What would be thought if parents found out that others are getting their way over their children, they would say what makes them so much more special than my child.

2,"Every person has read a book they wished was more child friendly. It is a fact of life that there will always be inapropriate books in public and @CAPS11 libraries.The thing is, the current generation that is running our socitey belives these inapropriate words and behaviors will impact the next generation in years to come. I bealive the libraries have a right to remove books, movies, magizines, ect., due to the views of censorship to a certain extent. The main reasons why I bealive that censorship should be usefull to an extent is because it takes away from historical novels, the fact of judgeing what is right and wrong, and it also eliminates the maturity leval of the books movies magizines, ect..     '@PERSON1', a great book from early @CAPS1 socitey, is being diminished due to its vulgar language and harsh themes. Some schools have been taking censorship very seriously and they are removing books like '@PERSON1' from the library. They also have made substitue books that are less graphic and use less prophanity. What the schools are really accomplishing is destroying our nations history. Those old books represent the @CAPS1 history, and without them our history will be lost forever. Unfortunatly without reading some inapropriate books, our children will not understand the consequences of acting inapproiate or the usage of vulgar language.     With the confusion of what is morally correct in society, parents are required to guide and remind their child of what is right and wrong. Without a good firm basis, children scream and eventually become disobidient. If children learn from their mistakes, they will be able to judge what societey views as right and wrong. Having this ability to judge weither an action is wrong or right, is a sign of maturity in that particular person. Once that maturity leval as reached its potential, the view or right and wrong in novels will come much easier.     Movies, music, and magizines now all have age limits. Movies tend to have a @CAPS3, @NUM1, or a rated @CAPS4 rating. The same goes with all sorts of media and literature. Videogames had @CAPS5 @CAPS9 for @NUM2+. Music has an explict label and a @CAPS6 @CAPS7 sticker. What this all means is the age in which the law thinks a persons maturity leval should be at, in order to handle this sort of media and, or literature. If censorship was taken into affect, the media would all be the same, and boring.Censorship can be a good thing if what has been censored is completly inapropriate.     The act of censorhsip should be used in some ways. For example, little children should not be reading 'The @CAPS8 @CAPS9' series, due to its inapropriate themes. The maturity leval of those children has not yet met the recomended standard in order for them to fully understand, and make correct judgments on the characters actions. In conclusion I do bealive censorship should be used in underaged learning, but not in the @CAPS10 @CAPS11, or the public library setting.Once again censorship, takes away from our historical novels, it does not allow the reader to make descions of what is right or wrong, and it eliminates the maturity leval or the book, movie, magizines, ect..",4.0,4.0,7.0

Kids are so intellegent we can no longer under estimate them.     Im pretty sure no mother/father wants his or her child seeing these things and i know this because i dont want mine to see these things. If so in a librarie they should seperate the adults things from the childrens. They can also have a area were all the things can go like a private room(must be eightteen or older and must show I.D).

2,I think that pornographic movies should be seperated from kids and teens so they can't get introuble with their familys and have the movie stores gets suid by there parents. But just pornographic should be in a different room where only adults can be allowed to go in and i believe they should have restricted areas.     If the movie stores get suid from teens and kids parents for letting their kids get a pornographic movies. So the movie stores would have to not let kids and teens get there hands on pornographic movies by makeing the law change the age to @NUM1 and older can get the movies. So now that teens are getting smarter by getting other adults to buy the pornographic movies for them so they dont get introuble and get better hidding spots so their parents cant find the movies.      But why do teens take pornographic movies from their parents and pay other adults to buy the movies for them is it to make them look cool in front of there friends. Teens could get introuble and parents should not be putting pornographic movies in a place were teens can find it.     So the one point is that kids should not be seeing pornographic movie by there parents letting them watch it because as a kid is little the kids brain is still developing. So that means by a kid watching porno that kid will get really sexually active as he gets older.       If the movie stores get restricted areas then kids and teens would not be able to get throw the doors of the restricted area. So they wont see it and wont be able to get pass it. The movie store won't get suid and won't have to worrie about it and can go on and not worrie about getting introuble. So adults can get pass it and get the video but teens and kids cant anymore.

2,"Clean the Shelves          Do people find it offensive when they find something in a magazine or a book with an inapropriate gesture? Should these books be aloud or should they be removed from the shelves? I do think we should get rid of these books, movies, music, and magazines. If people see these inapropriate comments in a book they might get mad.     When books are found to be offensive, the library should be responsible and get rid of them. You don't want random people getting upset over an offensive comment in a book, movie, and or music. Music and movies are a big problem too. Sure movies have ratings, but music doesn't. Any little kid can go in a store and by any music they want. Most music that they are buying have a lot of offensive language and shouldn't be heard by young ears. People should take action and start rating these books, magizines, and music so little kids can't just go and get them.     In my own experinces with reading, watching a movie, and listening to music, is that it is a lot more violent. It seems that with a movie thats rated @NUM1 it should of been rated @CAPS1. This also happens in magazines. All though most of them don't have ratings, they are still offensive. In the back of the magazine they have ads. It seems like they can put what ever kind of ad in any magazine and be fine with it. But most of these ads are very inapropriate and shouldn't be aloud. The librarians need to do something. They need to make a rating system based on age. So that when people see these offensive material there maturity level is equivelent to the book, magazine, movie, and or music they are watching, reading or listening to.     The offensive books, magazines, movies, and music should be removed from the shelves or have a rating system. It is for the better if the librarians take action and do this.

Also if you look at it all in a big picture we would be destroying the human race as we know it. There is no positive effect on taken things from a library.     If a book for instance for offensive to one person and that was enough to take it down then we would have no books. Evenetually everyone would have some problem with every last book and there would be nothing left. Without books we would not be were we are today. We learn about the past and the trial and errors humans have went through in our books. We learn how to live a normal live, by now without books we would be estinct.      Our offspring would be the stupidest people since the caveman age. With everyone taking away the books we would have nothing to teach our children but what we knew. Depending on when the books were taken, the whole world could just barely be getting by. Everyday children learn something from a book that will help them in there life. Wiether they know it or not some event will happen and each and everything you learn will go into it. By the @NUM1 or @NUM2 generation I think we would die off to another species because we would be sinking down to everyone else's level on the earth. Some other race would be able to take us out the more stupid we got.We learn from past people who have lived on this earth before us. Without the one before you, you would have learned nothing. Now think most people are not here from the past when you arive. Now how would they pass on their acknoledgement if there was not any books. They couldn't, eventually babies would be born with stupid parents that could barely feed themselves. The human race as we know it would die off all because we didn't want some kids to be influenced by the past. It is the past and what has happened. Whether you choose to shelter your kids they will find out and depending on how they do it could be bad. So teach them as much truth as you can before corrupt ideas like this get into there head.     This is why I think taking books away from anyone is @CAPS1! we would not learn half the things we know. Our children @MONTH1 never learn anything or live depending on the circumstances. Also by the third or forth generation that lived with no books we would eventually kill off the human race. So never decide to take books away from anyone",4.0,4.0,7.0

So trying to stop a writer from writering bad things that my be offensive to the reader or who ever else is a silly thing to do.But I think it shouldnt matter cause thoose are the kind of thing people want to read,watch on tv and it makes monye.So why would you try and stop something the world wants.     When people go to the grocrey store and there in line waiting  and they see the magazines with all the bad thing that people are going in the world and all the thing that are happing in the world people take intrest in that.And they pick up thoose things and read them. Like when @PERSON1 was hang his kids out the window and had them coverd up with towels and things people wanted to read about that and find out what was going on.     Or for example when pac-man jones got in to that fight at the club and he was about to get put out of leauge and was about to go to jail.And they had it all over @CAPS1 and all over the news,people want to hear about it to see what had happen that night. And then people were watching the news to see what him trouble were going to be.And to find out what happen that at the party.     finally it makes monye to the pres and who ever else.So why would you want to stop people from making monye and doing their job.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"In every person in the world their is something different about them. I know  not everyone is intersted in reading. The ones that like to be athletic dont need to worry if the books that @MONTH1 have a bad jesture on the library get tooken out. The people that love to read are going to be effected. The ones that read @MONTH1 like the books that are exciting and are bad, because of the excitement that it gives to them. The only books that people who dont like to read most of the time are books that @MONTH1 be not so good for them or other little kids, but atleast their reading to make them smarter everytime.     Im not much of a reader, but when i do read i read  these smaller book collection from the library. They are books about kids in bad neighborhoods that do things they will regret for the rest of their lives, from killing someone to doing drugs. They are very exciting books to me, so if they were going to take books like that away from our library i would probrobly not read much anymore. That would go for a lot of other kids as well in our school, because i know a lot of people who also reads these same books.      I believe that different materials that @MONTH1 be a bad influence to kids at the library should not be taken away. If the library has them, then they cant be that bad. I think that the materials like magazines and books give out information not just for our reading ability, but our projects and research papers that we have to do. The more you would have to think about it the more you would also see how much these not so good materials help us everyday.      If you dont want your kid to see the movies that they can get from the library,  then i would agree to maybe having the librayians only let twelve year olds and up get the movies then. Dont take it out on the people who use these for there excitement and homework just because you dont want your kids taking this off the shelf. The only reason why i would think someone would need to take this off the shelf, would have to be something like only for adults stores or talking about how to take drugs and get drunk. That would be understandable to me as a student.      This taking of the shelf thing because of offensive towards their children would effect a lot of people. I would be highly disapointed if this ever happened to our library here in town and at our school as well. It would take a lot of education away from our school and community as well. The people who think this is the wrong thing to be putting this offenisve materials out on the shelf need to relize how much it does for us students and for people who just want to research and find more about maybe why drugs are so addicting and what they can do to you. Someone @MONTH1 be doing a health project and need to use the drug books to finish up their projects. So if someone ever did take the materials off the shelves it would hurt most of us",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"The topic of censorship has always been a sensitive issue. Whether or not it should ever be used is an even more controversial debate. Since the dawn of free thought, there have always been those who have wished to control the freedoms and liberties of others. To many, this is how censorship is blatantly perceived; as control. Censorship is not a question of what is appropriate for the greater good of the whole, but rather what someone would lead you to believe is appropriate.      Music, movies, magazines, and novels should not be removed from shelves, for any reason. In truth, there should be limitations as to what is put on dispaly for the public, but this does not mean taking away the material entirely. This solution would simply mean placing more graphic items into a private area where age approved adults or groups could view the products. Not all novels or movies are meant to be seen by young children, just as I am sure that a parent would not want their child to view adult materials. However, this does not imply posing control over all materials that a society or a government feels necessary to deem 'unacceptable' by their standards. What someone does, or does not choose is right for them is their choice solely.      One would see it silly to imagine another person deciding what cereal they eat in the @TIME1, or what specific way they have to drive or walk or talk. To be told every single detail in your daily life, or even remotely so, would seem ludicrous. Why should the things we read, or watch, or listen to, be considered under any different circumstances? As a society, we should not be viewed as children, but as @CAPS1 of responsibility and moral. To censor or control what we wish to do or partake in, would be an injustice and a violation of our constitutional rights.      The beliefs of this country are set upon life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and more importantly equality. Even if a material is found offensive, the decision to take it away from the group of @CAPS1 as a whole does not lie entirely on the shoulders of one man, or one society. This decision would have to be made by the person who would choose to view that material. Each individual has the distinct ability to come to the conclusion if something is appropriate for them or not. No one else should be able to hold such a privelege.     Such as the quote states prior to the question asked for this essay, the truth in the statement is remarkable. If everyone found at least one material they saw unfit to be upon a shelf, and they had the right to take that material away from the whole, there would be nothing left on the shelves but dust. Of course, there will always be things that @CAPS1 find unsuitable or repulsive. This does not mean, however, that they have the right to control others seeing it.      Censorship is not a question of what is appropriate for the greater good of the whole, but rather what someone would lead you to believe is appropriate. Not a doubt crosses my mind when I say that censorship is an injustice. As a democracy we are allowed certain liberties and choices that must be debated upon amongst ourselves. Although what others do with such information or materials is beyond our control, we can still give them the opportunity to experience something great. The outcome @MONTH1 not always be how others expected it would, but the fact that they had the chance to view the material is what truly counts. Freedom is a facile thought, but censorship should never be accepted.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,I think that they shouldnt be took off the shelf because some of it is part of history. Some of this stuff is realy offensive should be but if its talking about history it should still be there. Some people need to just get over that they are there. Some people take it way  out fo perposion on some stuff.      All the books about @CAPS1 and stuff are offensive to them. All the books about the @CAPS2 are offensive to them but you dont see a bunch of @CAPS2 trying to take them off. Afercans take having a ritit over it. All the books that are offensive are apart of history. Some people just take it way to far. None of the books are ment to be offernsive its just wat happen in time. Some people have different oppentions on different stuff. Some people think that they should be off but i think they should stay on the shelfs. The only thang i dont get is why people get so mad about books like that. I mean its just a book its not like its happen to you in real life. So people get so mad when they see books like that and i just sit there and laugh because i think its funny there getting mad at a book.       I like to read those kindas of books. So i think they should stay on the shelfs. I know there are way more people then me out there that like those kinds of books too. Thats what i think about the offensive books should stay on the shelfs and not taking off at any point in time,3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Have you ever read a book that offended you in any way? Do you know of some horrible books, music, movies, or magazines that just should not be kept in libraries? Well, there are some materials out there that really offend people. Some books, movies, music, and magazines discriminate against a certain race or ways of life. What about the people that are that race or practice that way of life? They should not have to go to a public place, like a library, and be offended. Offensive materials should be taken off of library shelves because the library is supposed to be a safe place to take children, people who like these books can buy them online, and protesters probably are not good company anyway.      A library is a public place that is supposed to be comfortable for all of the public. Libraries are supposed to be suitable for families and children. In order to be suitable for everyone, there should not be any books, music, movies, or magazines that offend people. No one wants to take their children to the library and see their children find a book that is discriminating against them. No one should have to see materials that are discriminating against them. Therefore, it is the library's duty to make sure no one is offended by books and other materials in their library.      When you think of someone who likes books, movies and other things that offend people and hurt people's feelings, you think of someone that isn't very pleasant. Unpleasant people do not need to be at a library anyway. Protesters, who like to read the offensive books, might have strong feelings against the people the book is offending. There is a good chance they might have to see someone they have strong feelings against at the library. This is not a good idea. Eliminating offensive books, music, movies, and magazines eliminates the offensive people who read them. If the materials are eliminated, the library can remain a safe place with pleasant people.      If the book or other materials cannot be found at the library, there are other options for the person who wanting the materials. They can go to a book store and buy the book or magazine. Just because these materials are not at the library does not mean that they cannot be found anywhere. I myself have had to go online to buy a book before because I could not find it in the library. Going online or buying the book, music, movie, or magazines some other place is an option for people who want to read, watch, or listen to these materials.     I have read books about slavery that discriminated harshly against the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 race. I hope that no @CAPS1 @CAPS2 child ever has to see those books. If the offensive books and other materials that we all know of can be found in libraries, they are likely to be seen by people who atre offended. No one deserves to be offended when they are at the library. In conclusion, all libraries should take full responsibility in removing offensive books, music, movies, magazines and other materials from their shelves in order to try not to offend anyone",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Offensive Books     Do you think things that are offensive should be removed from the shelves of a library? I say no because if someone finds something offensive they could not read those kinds of books or don't go to that library. And im sure that most of the books in a library is offensive in some way. And if you take all those off the shelf you wouldn't have very many books left.      A second reason why libraries should keep offensive things on the shelves is because some people might enjoy reading things that might be offensive to someone. If someone finds a book that they like they come back for a different book so the library will have more customers.      I can also argue my opion because I can see why a library would want to take offensive books, movies, and magazines off the shelf because they do not want to hurt anyones feelings or anything and if someone finds something offfensive they might not come back to the library and they would tell other people about it. If someone would reed something that was offensive to them they would be very hurt on the inside so I could see why a library would take those kinds of things off the shelves.      After all that I still say that books and movies that are offensive should be left on the shelf because even if one person finds it offensive someone else might not and that person might want to reed that book and if the library didn't have that book people would not be able to reed it",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship is a big topic in many countries around the world including our own. Everyday governments burn, blackout, or change documents to better help them in their goal of complete control. It's a governments way of keeping some of its power in a more coniving and deceptive way. Although in the @LOCATION1 it's a @CAPS1 given right. Right?      Personally I believe that anyone should be allowed to write or read anything that they want. Isn't that the @CAPS2 dream? Doing what you want? People should be able to live without having the government censor or dictate every piece of offensive literature thats available to the masses. I think it's a gross misuse of power and a right that sadly most world governments take away every day. In my own life experiences my government is trying to become the most open door government ever, but reporters just found that this administration has censored more documents about what the government does than any other administration before them.     Now certainly there are exceptions to this as most dilemas have. Children is the main audience for this censorship. I understand like most parents that children are sensitive and don't need to see, hear, or read certain things at a ceratin age. I can comprehend that argument however it's the parents choice what they let their child see. That's why they have @CAPS3 and movie ratings, as well as childrens sections for books. In our society we try to ease our kids into the real world. I have no problems with that.      I believe that censorship is wrong and unjust. I believe that as an @CAPS2 you hold a right that very few have. I also believe that children shouldn't be subjected to adult material inadvertainly. As a country we can create a way for our children to live without sex shoved into their faces. In conclusion, censorship is wrong and a @CAPS1 given right that every @CAPS2 owns and should not be taken away from them",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I believe that it all depends on the type of library and the age group of most of the people that go to that library.  If it is in a high school then I think that the books do not need to be censored, but in a public library there should be a certain section with uncensored books and a childrens section with books that are appropriate for children.     Most children under the age of @NUM1 or @NUM2 should not be reading books about sex or drugs and alcohol.  The libraries in middle schools and lower should not contain uncensored books.  I believe that after middle school though, most of the kids already know what drugs and alcohol are and how they are harmful to you, and the books don't influence them to do it.  I also think that most kids by that time have also learned about sex and the risks of it, and they have already made up their mind whether or not they are going to do it before marriage or not.  Books that have violence in them should not be in elementary schools, however i think that other library's should have them on their shelves, because they are entertaining and i don't believe that they influence any normal person to do anything violent.     It all comes down to the age group of people that will be using the library.  I think that if all book are censored in elementary school and maybe even middle school libraries then they are fine to have in any other library.  If people really think it is necessary to do so they could put an age restriction on certain books, and if you are not of that age or older then you cannot purchase or check out that book from a store or library",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do I believe that certain material should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. No, I dont think they should be removed.

There is alot of offensive thing in the world and I dont think they can just be put away.      Libraries should split up adult book and children book so that children cant learn the bad language in the books.

2,"Should books, movies, magazines, etc. be banned or censored from library shelfs? In this essay I will voice my opinion on how I feel libraries should censor there books. I will disscus, how libraries are currently censoring there books, how certain books affect people, and how I feel libraries should organize and censore there content.     Libraries everywhere all have a different way of organizing there books. Currently, all the libraries that I know of have no sort of censoring policy within the library itself. Some of them do have certain books and or magazines that they do not allow within the library at all, but the books in the library are not censored. I fell that libraries have a right to decide what sort of books and other items they carry. I have been in many different libraries and every one of them has had a different content of items, but I have yet to go to one that has had a book that has offended me in anyway. I also think that people look to much into what things a library carrys, if a person doesn't want there child to read a specific kind of book then they should be the ones to regulate that rule, not the library. I have many friends of mine who's parents have told them they are not allowed to read a specific kind of book. They all follow this rule and they don't find it offensive that the library still carries these books. I do agree that some books or magazines shouldn't be allowed in a library but I don't think they should start taking books off the shelf because one person finds that specific book offensive.     People have started to become very uptight about how they view different aspects of daily life. One example is in the library. When a person isn't able to check out a book from the library anymore because to many people thought it was offensive, I think those people have become to uptight about that specific thing. I think that everyone has a right to read whatever they want. People need to take this into considerstion and have respect for this. I know of many families that don't allow their kids to read @ORGANIZATION1 because of the content of the book. I respect there decision to do this but I don't think that librarians should start pulling that book off the shelf because certain people don't like it. Different books affect  people in different ways but I don't think that we should start pulling books off shelves because they arn't agreed upon by the whole population.     I feel that the current way libraries are censoring and stocking thier shelves is a very smart, thought through process. I feel that libraries should not be allowed to have any dirty magazines or obseen music, and this concept, I feel, is being carried out very well. Of the libraries I have been to I haven't once found a dirty magazine or obseen music there that was able to be checked out. I think this is a good thing because I do feel that those types of things are not appropreit for a public library. I like the content that the libraries have decided to keep. I am able to walk into a library and find a book on almost any subject. I agree with how they are currently censoring there books and I feel they should be able to continue in this manor.     I have voiced my opinion on the topic of, 'should libraries be allowed to ban or censor their books.' I think that the current system that libraries have for censoring books is a very good one. I understand that all books affect people differently but I think that people need to respect othere peoples feeelings towards books. Meaning the libraries shouldn't have to censor or ban these books but they should keep in mind how different people feel. I like the current library organization system and I feel that the libraries are all doing a fine job of making keeping the peace within the confines of their libraries.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"We cannot control everyone and tell them what to read. It is their own choice. It wouldn't be fair to only allow them what certain individuals find approiate. Every human has their own rights. We cannot take that away. Parents can tell their children what they are allowed to listen to, what shows to watch, and what they can read. As for an adult, I don't think it should be up to someone else. It has been your whole life, and by now you should be ready to make mature choices on your own.      On the other hand, now a days there is a lot of violent, and bad behavior that can influence children to behave in a unhealthy mannor. We can't get rid of all of that completly, and we never will. Procautions have been made to help influece what you watch. Such as the movie ratings, and on games it has ages for what group it is sutible for.  At most public libraries you have to be a certain age to be able to rent out movies. That is something you could do. The individual would have to be a particular age to rent that item, if it is considered offensive. You have to be a certain age to get a library caard without parental consent. There is ways for children not to view these items. I don't think it's the libraries reponsibility. Considering the library already bought these items to rent out, I don't see how they can just get rid of them.      Many individuals are mature enough to watch, listen and read more progatory materials then others. It really depends on the person, their age and if they are mature enough to not think that these things are the right way. Others are not and there is no way to take this away from them. There are many other ways to access this information. Without a library.     My mom and I watch a series on television that is  called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2'. It is a violent show, and shows things that use to never be shown on tv, but now a  lot of shows do. We often wonder if these shows give 'killers' ideas or make them behave worse and show some ways to help them be more sneaky to not get caught. For me, it doesn't influenece me in any way. It is only a show. I know that to others it can be more than that and influence them to do harmful things.      Everything is more open now then it use to be. Even if libraries were to remove certain items, there are others ways for the child to access them. There is on demand televison, internet, etc. The parent can lay down the rules, but I don't think it's the libraries responsibilites to remove these items.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship is an extremely opinionated topic.  Some people believe that children shouldn't be reading, listening, or watching offensive or explicit materials, but why?  Today, offensive materials are all around us.  Offensive materials are on @CAPS1, in music, in magazines, in books, and even reality.  Even if its censored, I feel like people would still see it.  In my opinion, censorship would be too much work and trouble to attain.     At this point, censorship would be extremely difficult to achieve.  People would object to it and even reject the idea of censorship.  Once offensive materials are out and are at every turn and twist, its going to be hard to just take away such freedom.  Everyone has different ideas on what is offensive and what isn't offensive.  Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The result of censorship could lead to losing most materials since everyone has a different perspective on offensive materials.  There are even some materials that you just can't censor, for example, history.  Hitler had some pretty offensive beliefs so if censorship existed, then we wouldn't be reading much about him.      When given so much freedom, it might be hard to swallow the fact that offensive materials could be censored.  Some @CAPS2 @MONTH1 even be outraged by this.  I honestly think that we shouldnt even try to censor offensive materials.  We could be focusing on more important things than just sweating the little stuff.  Censorship would overall just cause fighting and losing all of our materials, offensive or harmful.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe that certain movies, books, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves. When doing this, people are being deprived of knowledge, and they are being limited by society as well. Certain topics @MONTH1 strike off as 'Offensive' but people deserve to know the truth. Refusing to put certain books, movies, magizines, ect., on the market because it @MONTH1 be offesive is , in some sense, breaking the law. We deal with this issue alot in our every-day lives.          There are certain books out , in world, that talk about serious issues, such as slavery, racism, and other topics that @MONTH1 offend people. When books with deep topics such as those are tucked away from the public its known as censorship. One book or movie shouldn't be taken away from the general public because one group of people @MONTH1 be offended by it. Censorshhip is just a form of hiding the truth from the peopels eyes.     When our country was being created and formed into the successful country it is today, a document was made and sign called the @ORGANIZATION1. Throughout this document were amendmants which were freedoms that the people of the @LOCATION1 had. One of the most important ones , to me, is the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. This amendmant gives the people a right to speak out on their opinions. Now if a person makes a book about how they feel about a topic the market shouldn't hide the book from the public because it is offensive. Its a right that we , as @CAPS3,  to be able to tell the our people how we feel about something.     I dont think that a book should be shout out from a child because they are young. They should be able to read what they want to read no matter what it is. Once when i was younger i went to the library to get a book. Well i found this nice comic book and when i went to go check it out they told me that i was too young to get the comic book. So i was furious about that but i did what i was told and found something else to read. Another time when i went the library i picked up the movie '@CAPS4' and the librarian told  me i was too young to see that movie but my mother went and got the movie for me to watch because it was apart of my heritage. It doesn't matter the age of a person for them to want to learn.     Books, movies, and other forms of writing should not be hidden from the people. Age makes no difference of a person will to know certain things. People have the right to say what they want to say and say how they want to say.

Books that talk about sex is not right or should be and school.It give kids the rights to think that sex is cool when you have book like that and school or anywhere else. I believe that safe sex is very important and everyway and these books and school do not talk about it. I believe if you going have a book like that and school talk about the important things about it. A lot of people do not like to see books like that. I think books that talk about how sex feels good and things should be removed from the shelf. Some moms and dads do not want there kids to see or read about how good sex feels. I believe if we going have books like these on are shelf first talking about them and see how others feel about it because everyone don't feel the same about books and you should give people there respect.

I have seen many books in libraries that seem offensive. I just don't read them. I read what I want to read and other people should to. This is the same thing with music and movies. Why would you want to buy a movie that doesn't even interest you? It's just that simple.      A book shouldn't be kept off the shelf just because it is offensive to you. Other people might like to read about things that you don't like. One oppinion won't change the mind of the libraries placement of a book.

When you hear about people finding things offensive in a public place I find it a little ridiculous. If they don't want to rent it that's one thing but to make a big deal of something they have no controll over is another. If you have beliefs and things of that sort, that's fine, but not everybody has those same beliefs. All you have to do is simpily not rent the book, movie, magazine, music, etc. That's why I think that these things should not be romoved from the libraries.      Everyone has their own opinons that's just the way it always has been and always will be. But you can't please everybody by pleasing one person, and taking books, movies, music, ,agazines, etc. out of liraries because one person finds them offensive isn't going to please everyone. One thing that you @MONTH1 find offensive someone else @MONTH1 really like and @MONTH1 interest them, not everyone is the same. So, if you go to a public library looking for a certaint thing and you come upon something that you find offensive you can either walk away or rent book and things  another way. Insted of going to the library you can order books on an online bookstore or visit another book store. To rent movies or music you can go to a place like @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1, where you can also get magazines. You can avoid places that you find offensive you just have to research.      Removing things from the self would only make the certain people happy, and that won't result in a positive outcome. People can can simply visit another store with the same books, movies, magazines, music, etc. just finding something offensive isn't a reason to change things. These are all the reasons why i feel like these things should not be removed from the public libraries",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"In my opinion and probably many others is, I don't believe that just because some material is offensive to one person it should be removed from shelfs from libraries or stores. You shouldn't have to remove the material just becuase it offends someone. If you removed everything that someone said offened them there problaly wouldn't be any material for anyone to enjoy.      I believe this because sometimes when the material is offensive to one person it can be a learning material to someone else. Almost everyone is offened by something in the world. Just because a book or a song says that a certain type of person is something doesn't mean its true. People can learn to ignore some of the stupidity out there and learn that just because someone says it doesnt mean its true.       For example one time my school had a guest speaker. The guest was very nice and was telling everyone about his life experiences. Not everything was offensive til he started preaching about god, And in my behave I didn't believe it was right to. As bad as I wanted to get up and walk out i didn't. Me walking out could of offended someone else so i sat there and enjoyed the rest of what he had to say. I just kept thinking just because he said to believe in god doesn't mean i have too. So everyone should do that. Just because a song or a book says something doesn't mean it's true.      I understand that some material @MONTH1 be very offensive to some people but taking it off the shelfs @MONTH1 offend someone else. If someone is offened that bad by something they don't nesscary have to listen to it or read about, theres plenty of other things they can read about. If they avoid whats offensive the best thing to do is ignore it.     In over all i really don't believe just because some material is offensive it should be removed, just because one store takes it off the shelfs doesn't mean the next store you walk into will. Your going to run into something offensive somewhere sometime in your life, best thing to do is learn from it. Remember if this one thing offends you that something you @MONTH1 do or say @MONTH1 offend someone else. The world can be a curel place.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Because we are all different, we all have different opinions. Things that some people find offensive @MONTH1 be no problem to another group of people. There is no definite answer to what is offensive. Libraries should not have the right to tell other people what is okay to read and what is not.      Libraries are public places that are there to help the community receive books and other sources of information. They are not around to tell people what is good and bad. What one person finds offensive, another @MONTH1 find very interesting. Telling someone that the material they enjoy is offensive to other people could be considered offensive as well.     Everyone who enters a library belongs to a certain age group. These various age groups make it impossible to please everyone. For example, elderly people tend to find teenage topics inappropriate; therefore, they would have this material taken off the shelves. Teenagers will only read or listen to what appeals to them. If libraries were to remove the materials that appeal to teens because of what does not appeal to elders, the teenagers would have no reason to return to the library.     Some of the things that happened in history could be considered offensive as well. Just because it is part of our history does not mean that it is okay with all other people. If fictional stories are censored due to their content, nonfictional stories should be also.      No one should be able to tell people what is appropriate for them to read and what is inappropriate. One good thing that most libraries do is separate the material based on content. The judgement of whether or not something is intended for teens, children, etc. is fine. Censorship such as that is better than censorship that completely removes the material.      Libraries should not have the right to tell other people what is okay to read and what is not. If libraries were to try to censor their materials to please the community, not everyone would be happy. It is impossible to please everyone. Therefore, libraries should keep their personal opinions to themselves and let the people make their own decisions",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I would agree that things found offensive in items at libraries shoulb be taken out. Yes that is true that mainly everythibng on the shelves in a library has offensive language and to take it off would make people that arent children mad of the fact that they might like having that type of language in it. I think that there should be an age limit on books, music, movies and magazines so that younger kids dont see the not so good areas of materials so that they dont get ideas that are bad or undermining. I have seen movies and books that have pornography and that had foul and intimate language that i really did not like seeing.",2.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Are Books for Everyone?    I do agree that there are books, movies, magazines, and music that children should not see or hear. However, I think removing them from shelves isn't the best solution. Taking them down could anger other readers. What if someone had to get a book for their parent, friend, or siblings? Would it be right to take that privilage away because of age? Being able to check out things should be a right.     Taking the freedom of being able to read, or check out the materials that you would want to see is not such a good idea in my opinion. There are readers out there that read certain things with valgur language, or inapproperate things. I bet with the books now you could rarely find anything without valgur things in them.     There might be a child or teenager who is asked by a family member, or friend to get a book that they want to read. This person might be busy working, cooking, or cleaning, and just doesn't have the time to run down to their local library to get a book. However, seeing that their child is doing nothing, they might ask if they would get that book, or movie for them. If that person would do the task asked by that certain person, I don't think it would be fair that they couldn't get that book because they aren't quite @NUM1 years of age. That is how most libraries work now.    Those are not just the only two reasons why keeping books where they are is a good thing. Another would be maybe you yourself was looking for a book you really wanted to read. However, you only new this author by one of his other books inteded just for adults. Yes, you think you can just look the book up on a computer, but sometimes that's not always an option.      So what I am saying is that people should watch for things that their children read and watch, but not have those things taken off of shelves. Being able to take whatever book you want should be a privilage that everyone should have. That's why books, movies, magaines, and music should stay where they are in libraries",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship, the idea of removing media from somewhere (in this case, in a library) for being offensive, has created disputes everywhere. A library, a place for unlimited media and discovery, is suddenly limited by censorship. Personal opinions create the different opinions on what is and what is not offensive. Although censorship has caused many disagreements, censorship should not be used in libraries, a place of learning.      A library is seen as a media center full of mostly books. But also taking into account the music, movies and magazines that are available, once can find almost any information on almost any topic. Even walking into a library, no matter how big or small, one can visually see the variety and broadness, a place full of availibility. If censorship is enacted, that place of availability and discovery is limited. Topics suddenly become less broad and do not have as much vigor as they did before. Censorship is seen as a way of protection for some, and it is also seen as limiting for others, a valid point. Protection from offensiveness can be beneficial in some cases, but some are able to learn exactly what 'offensive' means through full confrontation with it. Regarding education and learning, why would anyone want their discoveries to be limited?     Censorship and its purpose have been disagreed on, a disagreement that stems from individual opinions of what is offensive. For example, a book found by one person to be offensive can be found by another to be quite interesting. Most importantly, every person has a right to pick a book off of a library shelf to read. If that person finds the book personally offensive to them, they have the same right to put the book back. Regardless of whether an author realized their work was going to cause disputes, one thing is certain- the author of a certain book wrote the book for a specific reason. Just like a musician composing a piece of music for a specific reason, or a movie director and actor working together to create a movie for a certain reason, each is an artist whos purpose is to make their work of media known. Censorship limits their right to do just that.      An author @MONTH1 write a book, or an musician @MONTH1 compose music, but there is no purpose if their own masterpiece will be banned. Libraries would not be seen in the same light- they would be seen as a dead end, a location where only a few books and topics could be researched upon. Each person has a right to choose a book on any subject, at any point in time. Censorship would be robbing each person of that right. Learning, an essential part of education and life, would be taken away within seconds.",4.0,4.0,7.0

For example theres things like bad associations in school or in the community, but there is always a place you can go to and relax and enjoy your day.

The essay that I have to write about is weather certain books, music, movie, or even magazines should be removed.

There was one day our class had to go the library and write an essay on any book of our choice. So like I mentioned I hated to read so i tried to get out of doin the assignment but i couldn't.

2,"There is always something that is going to offend someone. Are we going to eliminate that something, everytime someone gets offended? I think that certain things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be removed from the shelves just because someone finds it to be offensive. Many can find that source that is offensive to another, interesting; and can even be life changing.     When slavery was going on back in the days, there were many who wrote the discrimination they faced on a daily base.  They expressed thier feelings on a piece of paper because that gave them hope.  Hope that maybe one day thier work will get into the hands of someone, and their heart be touched. And let me tell you, it worked.  People started seeing that color does not matter, in @CAPS1 eyes we are all equal. This literature probably offended many whites who read it.  They could have thought, 'how can we do such a thing as this?' @CAPS2 @MONTH1 have got angry that many were beginning to take side with the blacks. But did this change how we live today?       Literature is something that is going to be viewed in many different ways.  We don't all have the some opinions and thoughts. But thats okay because we are human and it's normal.  That is why, if you are in a libary and you find something that offeneds you; don't read it and put it back.  If it didn't interest you it @MONTH1 interest another.       I have @MONTH1 friends who listen to music, that I hate to listen to. I actually find it fairly offensive. For example, a really famous known rapper,'@CAPS3 @CAPS4,' so they call him.  I really dislike his music. A lot of people can't belive it when I say it. But the truth is that I think his music is stupid. What's the point of listening to music when every other word is a curse word.  But anyway that's just my opinion; you might think different.     So do I think such things should be removed from shelves? No, I think they should be kept right where they're at.  Unlike you, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 love the book, magazine, or what ever it @MONTH1 be.

2,"The right to go to the library, and take off a book from the shelf is an equal opprotunity for everybody. Libraries give equal opprotunities to everybody to check out material. There should be no such things asremoving materials from the shelves at a libray that someone finds offensive. Libraries provides book to others to inform them about certain issues, to provide material for others that can't afford to buy the materials, and they also provide enjoyment to others.      Some people might think that libraries should take off offensive material from their shelves; libraries offer that material to provide information to others. If a person finds something offensive to them, then they shouldn't read that certain book, magazines, or materials. Libraries provide certain information to help others gain knowlege, or to provide them with an enjoyment, not to offend others. Libraries shouldn't have to take off information off their shelves because they are offending somebody, but they are mearly providing information to others that apprishiate the information.     Libraries have spent huundreads of dollars providing material to children, adults, mothers, fathers, and the elderly. There are so many people that can't afford to buy books, music, and movies of their own. Chilren of all ages go to a library to gain information, and check out books that they take an intrest in.

2,"Dear @CAPS1,          I strongly believe that censorship is not a problem or a defect in a public library. I say this for these reasons.          Books are not put in libraries to discriminate against anyone. In my opinion, if a person feels offended by the content of any resource in a library its their own personal problem. Everyone who visits a library doesn't go searching for the same things, some people are intrigued by resources other are not. I think it would just be wrong to remove contents from libraries due to censorship.        Libraries are here to inform us on things we dont know, rather its good or bad, it's here for our knowledge. If their are things adults dont want their children seeing or doing, I strongly suggest they confront them, not the libraries. These educational structures have been built to help children and provide them with a quiet place to learn, not to dicinegrate their minds. I know for sure there are other ways to prevent kids from discovering censored material.          For example, sections of the library with censored material can be sectioned off with adult supervision. Kids who enter this section must be a certain age to even enter this part of the library. By doing this, I'm pretty sure that alot things can be prevented and it'll save alot of pure young minds. Most of all it'll give their parents peace of mind, atleast as far as libraries go.          In all, No I don't support the idea to remove books from the library. I believe it is very self-centered simply because there are millions of people who tend to and like millions of different things. If libraries section off censored areas, like I said. The children might not be as happy, but the parents would be overly satisfied!",3.0,3.0,4.0

Even when you don't know if you want to listen to country music or rap. Nobody ever tries to stop you from checking it out either. I mean, if i disliked a book so much and my friend went to check it out, I'd tell her to rethink her choice. Some books and music selections in the public @CAPS1 aren't really apropriate. I believe some should be taken out, organized seperately, or just put away for a while.     I've never really had to complain about a book that i've read. Usually all of mine are books my friend tells me to read. I enjoy sad books, and not the fun happy ones. Weird, i know. I will tell you a time when i went to get a book and it was so inapropriate that i couldn't read on after the seventeenth page. Books that involve sexual things just arent something i want to read. First of all, i was in the @NUM1 grade. I was getting a book at the @CAPS1. Of course i had already read all the kids books, so i went on to the bigger and better books. Not that they were really orgainzed into age groups or anything,  you just kind of knew what ones to get. I picked up a book that was about murder. Like I said, i was in the @NUM1 grade. As i was reading the book, the details got really grucem and started talking about how a girl got raped. I wasn't enjoying the book at all, but i kept reading because sometimes they get better as they go on. This one never did. It kept repeating the same things over and over again. It was terrible and i couldnt read it. When i went to return it back to the @CAPS1, they started yelling at me about checking it out. No one ever told me I wasn't allowed to check it out. They said you needed to be a little older to read the book and whoever let me check it out should have known. I got in a fight with the librarian. I told her she needed to start organizing the books into age groups. She actually listened to me. That @DATE1 I was in there restocking all the books with her. She knew me so well, she knew that I would never intentionally pick up a book about rape and other things of that sort. Organizing was definitely the best thing for that @CAPS1.     Since the little book switch up incident, and reorganization of the @CAPS1, I've never mistaked another book. Now that i know where all the  books are and the kind I want ot read, im not nervous about getting yelled at anymore.

Music has been around just as long as we have been, and to some people it is everything. Like this guy i knew he had come to find himself to be in a rut in his life, got into some pretty bad things. One day I told my friend that if he kept living the life that he was living, he wouldn't have a life to live soon.

Music,movies,and games show consumers of the particular that some cd's dvd's and others have warning labels such as: rated @CAPS1, rated @CAPS2, rated @NUM1 and so on and so forth. I do however believe that books and movies and things of that nature, should be released to the public with a type of precaution for the reason that even though it looks safe it usually is the exact opposite.If we were to pull all the books and streams with bad language, obscene literature and others,we would be eliminating over half of the general reading,streaming populace. Another concern that people have is that of which: 'If this title is offensive why do they openly just give it to anyone who wants it.' That is a very important statementbecause if you don'@CAPS2 want parents to get to a point where they protest against the things that their children read, there should be restrictions on them.

2,"Have you ever checked out a book that didn't seem unappropiate at all,  but it ended up to be very disturbing? I personally have not and I don't know many people that have either. The censorship in libraries is not a problem.      First of all, when people go to the library they usually have a purpose. Usually their purpose is to find a good book to read or to get a book that gives them information on a subject they want to know more about. For example,  a teen usually goes to the 'teen' area of the library and looks at the books there. Librarians would not place an uncensored book there, so parents don't have to worry about that problem. If an adult wanted an uncensored book than they should go to the ''adult'' section.     Most libraries that I have been to, have a well organized shelving system. Children's books are usually censored. Authors don't write or draw offensive, disturbing, or uncensored things in children's books. It wouldn't be labled a children's book if it did have any of those things.When a library purchases a book, the librarian usually lables what audience the book is for.     I must admit, there is a problem. The problem is with some 'teen' books. Some of teen books have some sort of sexuality in it. I know parents wouldn't want their teen focusing in those things yet, or probably never, but they will  someday.     In conclusion, people don't need to worry about the censorship in libraries. The library is meant for peacefullness and quite time. When people go to the library its supposed to be calm. People should not be disturbed about a book, if they are the ones who went to the wrong section to look for their books.",3.0,4.0,6.0

I like that because its true if everyone in the world had the right to remove books from the shelves then we wouldn't have any books for anyone to read. Everyone has a different view on what they flag as approprite or inapproprite for young people or young adults to read. People who are racest would most likely say that books writen by blacks should be removed well there goes a percentage of books, while someone whos against drugs, violence, and anything else would say that those books need to be removed well that half of the books are gone.     Most people dont realize what people use books for some people use books for education, some use books as a get away, and some use books as a way to figure things out. By education I mean as a way to learn about different things like a book about violence or sex abuse/rape could learn ways to avoid those situations. Everyday I hear teens talking about this book they read, talking about how they read about some young girl getting ubducted at her bus stop. They were telling about how that story made them think of ways that they could avoid that type of situation. Honestly I feel like if it wasn't for books kids, teens, and even adults wouldn't know what to do in certin situations they would be stuck. Because everyone knows that when a person is talking to you, you tend to zone out or just ignore everything that is said to you I mean you might catch part of it but we all know you won't remember it all. Thats why books come in handy because while you might not catch all of it, it will still be there for you to look over and figure out what you were missing.     Books are an excellent source of information and removing all books when giving people the option to would just mess the education process up. I mean its not just books you also have movies, magazines, video games, and music if you took all that out of the system we would have nothing we wouldnt know nor would we learn anything on our own. All the stuff we have in the world today all serves its on perpose and we use all of it to our advantage.      Thats why I think that we shouldn't have the right to remove stuff that we want to because people would make stupid decisions and we as the people would lose everything we have. So I say no, to giving people the right to say what goes on the shelf and what comes off of it. But I say yes, to having more materials come out onto the shelf",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship in Libraries               @CAPS1 thoughts on the topic of 'Censorship in libraries' is  that it is not right because people should be able to read , listen , look what ever they want. No one should be able to make the decision to limit how much a person can learn.     If everone took something off the shelfs there would be nothing on them.And thats all just opinion on that thing .just because someone is offened by it dosent mean that everyone is.     If you don't like it you should just not get it or look away because someone worked really hard on it.And someone else @MONTH1 need  read it because it corresponds with whats going on in there life.     I'm a muscian and if they told me that i can't listen to a certain type of music i would be livid!Just because i don't always agree with others taste in music .No should tell me I can't play or sing a certain song because it offeneds someone.     In conclusion I don't agree with censorship.I think its a mediocre attempt to control peoples beliefs.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Whether it was a book you were reading or a song you were listening to, I'm sure you thought 'wow, this is highly innapropriate' at least once before in your life. Although, just becuase you dislike a song or book doesn't mean eveyone else hates it.     Freedom of speech, that's what we are said to have in @LOCATION1. Therefore, music and books shouldn't be banned because some find it offensive. We are legally allowed to say whatever we choose in @LOCATION1, and that's also allowed in all forms of writing. I don't believe removing books due to offensivness is fair.     If someone takes the time to write a book, then they must be attempting to send out a message to the reader. The type of book doesnt matter, it can be information, fiction, non fiction, or just a book of poems, the author still writes it for a meaning. The reader will find at least one way they can connect with the writing. A book @MONTH1 be about how horrible the @CAPS1's were in @CAPS2 in the @DATE1's, some @MONTH1 find that highly informative and a great source of information. On the other hand, a different person @MONTH1 be reading that book and is a @CAPS1 himself, wouldn't that person find that book offensive? Most likely the man would despise that book, but just because one man dislikes it doesn't make it right for it to come off the shelves.     I have had an experience where I have found a book extremely repulsive, To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 was the tittle. This book ambushed on blacks the entire story, and being a black girl reading this, I had a hard time enjoying it. But just becuase I didn't enjoy it, doesn't mean every other one of my peers hated it also. I didn't like the book and I will never like it, but that still doesn't give it the right to be banned from anyone reading it. I did learn things about blacks while reading it. Things that I wasnt educated on before reading that book.     In the end, everyone is entitled to thier own opinion. Some @MONTH1 like a book and some @MONTH1 hate that same book. Books are meant to be read and then reviewed on, they aren't meant to be read, hated, then banned. All books need to stay on the shelf, no matter what the genre, topic, or length of the book.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Books, music, movies, and magazines have been censored in some way throughout history. Books, music, movies, magazines usually inform their reader or listener about a specific topic. Unless they are directly criticizing something such as the books about @CAPS1 during the @CAPS2 then they should not be removed from shelves.     First off, people have a right to choose what type of material they read. Removing books, music, movies, or magazines would take away their right to choose. Also, people are entitled to have an opinion. It should be up to that particular person if they want to read or listen to something. People can make choices on their own, so let them be able to make them!     If someone finds something in a book, song, movie, or magazine offensive then they should simply place whatever they were reading or listening to back on the shelf. Whether or not something is offensive to somebody should be up to the person with the item. It depends on that persons maturity. If they are mature enough to handle the material within the item then there will not be a problem. If not, then place the item back on the shelf incase another person is mature enough to handle it.     Furthermore, taking any of the following off a shelf could mean taking potential knowledge off the shelf. As said before books, music, movies, and magazines usually inform their reader. If  one of those is removed, it could be taking away valuable knowledge to that person. If somebody wants to educate themselves on what happened during the @CAPS3 and books or movies about it are taken off shelves, then that person will be robbed of knowledge that they have a right to learn about.     Therefore, it should not be up to anybody but the government to have books, music, movies, or magazines removed from shelves. We can make decisions or our own. Whether that decision is right or wrong should be up to us in the end. The decision of whether or not a book is offensive to one will not effect the entire world. So, it should be up to the person making the decision as to whether or not they want to censor the material to themselves",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Books that are found offensive in the library should not be removed. The book could have been interpreted wrong, but the book is just like any other one of the many books on the shelf, the only difference is that the content is for a different audience.      Many books can be found offensive to many different kinds of people, but that does not mean we should take it off the shelf of the library. That only means that that book is not meant for that kind of person. Many people read information in different ways. Some @MONTH1 be offended, and others will not. That is why libraries should not remove the book but catagorize it differently.     The book that is found offensive should be placed in a different place in the library and not entirely removed from society. The library should catatgorize books in a way that they are put into age group as well as what type of book it is. The system @MONTH1 be complicated, but if people are becomeing offended by a book, then this is a possible solution for that certain problem.     If libraries are not willing to go to that great of an extent and the book really is offensive in every way, it still shouldn't be removed from the shelves. Removeing the book from the shelve would be violating freedom of speach. Instead, the book have a warning lable attached on the front of the book so people will know that the certain book they are about to read is considered offensive to multiple people.     Many people find many things offensive and everyone will always find some kind of book, magazine, movie or song offensive. That is why we have freedom of speech and the freedom to express how we feel on any kind of subject. If you took that song or book away then we would not have known what that person's opinion is on what his book was about.     So in the end, we should never be remove a book, album, or movie from the library shelf, offensive or not. That is the way the artist or author chose to express his or herself. The book is still a part of history and so is that album or movie. That is the way they chose to express themselves. If the book or album is offensive then don't read or listen to it. Find something else that is not offensive to you. This is why anything from a library shelf should not be removed.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Writing materials that @MONTH1 need to be removed from libraries, in the opinions of some, should be left alone. These books were the works of their authors, and this makes it the authors opinion or work. They were paid to produce these works, and hired to do so. If they were put in a position like this, it should be okay. They were also checked over before published in the first place, therefore they truly are okay to the public that they were itended for. items, such as book, magazines, songs, and other works, should not be removed from the public due to the lack of censorship.           If these works are portreyed as improper, or offencive, then maybe the public should restrict themselves from these things, not the other way around. Lets say a parent does not want their child to watch a @CAPS1 rated movie, this becomes the parents job not the library's. Just because the type of media they chose was not suitable to them does not mean it is not to others, therefore maybe they need to look at a different section of the library. Maybe some people's opinions are different from others, hence the rating systems purpose. The scale is to determine a basic system for judging media and it's quality. People can chose to follow this if they want, and usually the scale will reflect what the producer intended. So why should a library be forced to remove something they bought just because someone is not going about the proper way to see if it is suitable to them.          If someone is paid to produce media of a certain type, wouldn't you presume they were good at it? Another arguement apon this matter could simply be that. If someone is being paid to produce something, they are obviously good at what they do and their products should not be censored, to an extent like eliminating it from libraries. A production company does check the work that comes out of their building, so why is it need to be checked again. People are hired just to check works like these, so therefore the library should not need to remove something that has been checked. Also, if someone is hired to be apart of the media like this, maybe people should learn more about that person before criticizing their work. The work @MONTH1 not be the problem, but the producer is. Maybe the work that comes from someone is okay, just the message or the intention of that person wasn't. Perseptions like this are needed to be taken when looking at media any ways. If it isn't, then what the audience is getting won't make as much sence as it should. Maybe this misconception is what is causing people to want to remove things from a library.         The media should not be censored in a library due to the reasons that have been stated. People are  hired to do a job, and if that job is to produce media, then they must be pretty good at what they do. People are also hired to check works just so this is not a problem. These are also the people who made rating systems. Rating systems have been made for these reasons as well. But above all, maybe it isn't the library's as much as the person who obtained the media. They should have been more careful in what they chose. So the libraries are not to blame for this matter, not so much as the people who were criticizing the products they obtained",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Is it right to remove books, magazines, music or movies from the shelves just becouse one person beleves that it is inapropeat? Yes, there are some books that I beleve that should not be on the shelves at a library but, they should not be removed compleatly. If some parent dose not want their children reading certan books thin they have the right to remove that book from their private sheves at home but not at the libarary.     No, I beleve that we should not remove books from the shelves at a library just because one or two parents do not want their children to pick it up or even see it. If there is a book that you do not want your children to read thin you have the right to tell them that they can not read that and teach them not to pick up books that you bleave to be inapropeat. Katherine Paterson said '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right so does everyone else.'  So if you do not want you child to read a certan book, watch a certan movie, or listen to a certin type of music then you have the right to take it away from them because, you are the parent who has the right to remove shuch things from your childrens life. Katherine Paterson also said '...And then we have no books left of the shelf for any of us.' I take that to mean that if we take all the books off the shelf that we do not want are kids reading then there will be no books for the adults to read.          So if all the books that each parent in the world found inapropeat were removed from the shelves from home, a store, or the library then there will be no books left for any of the adults or the more mature kids. If you realy truly beleave that all books that just one person findes inapropeat and they get their way and those books are removed then how is that fair to those parents who want to read that book them selfs to see if it is appropeat for their child.      There are some books that were taken off the shelfs and are not even aloud to be read in the school just because there are a few words in that book that a kid or a parent might not agree on wether it is because they take offence to that book or to a single phrase in that certin book. It is simmiler to when @PERSON2 removed the natanoual day of prayer not to offend anyone but what about the @CAPS1? In some schools you are not aloud to read the @CAPS2, or pray they want to take religion out of school just because there might be one child or parent that might take offence to it. If you want to take reading certin books, listing to certin music or watching a certin movie and even religion go right on ahead but do it at your home not in public where it can offend other people, because, your oppion of what is offencive to you might just offend other people. So, if you find something offencive just keep it out of your house and not make other people suffer just because of your views and or beleafes.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"When mankind was young and primal the stories created by mankind were passed through oral translation. However these stories were subject to decay as the human mind can not recall evey detail that it hears. Great stories that are lost to time will never be recovered. Then written languages were developed to keep better more accurate records of data and stories that were told. Many sheets of written work were bound together into what is now known as a book. Archealogists have found troves of books predating @CAPS1 and many thereafter. These books let us peer into the past with such detail that no human could remember the remarkable events that took place in that time. Books are still published following the traditional use of information transmiter and story teller but they have changed in their content. When many books were written in @LOCATION2 many feared to speak openly about their views through their books for fear of persecution by the @ORGANIZATION2. Today in a more evolved society where people can speak freely some books are published that do not fit everyone's ideaologies. But why should the authors be afraid of this? Haven't we evolved as a people to let people speak their beliefs and not fear prosecution? I think so.     The world today is filled with many religions and beliefs that all share different views of our history and of world events. This can cause uproar when a book is published that does not agree with the individuals belief's. There have been a few books published in the last @NUM1 years that have caused such outcry's that cause people to desperatley want to remove them from the children's eyes. One such book is '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. This book is the story of a black man and his master during pre-civil war times where slaves were legal. This book could be considered hainous to readers soully on their morals. The story is graphic at some points throughout the novel and can anger people. Many school's and instituion's have already banned this book from their libraries. Some books such as '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4' can clearly be denoted as 'harmful,' or 'inhumane,' to some readers. However, people opposing the banning of this particular book state that 'Our children need to learn from history so they do not repeat it.' And many take this as a valid arguement.      Then again, some books are hated entirely for their content because it does not agree with a person's religion. A more recent example of a book series that some say is, 'unfit,' and 'harmful,' for a child to read is the famous @CAPS8 @CAPS9 series. Millions of people enjoy the book series for it's stories of a young boy at a wizard school. But some people banned their children from reading them because they believe that the book is telling children that witchcraft is an acceptable practice. This extremely violated their religious views and wanted the book series to be removed form library shelves everywhere. This arguement is just as legitimate as the one for '@CAPS2 @CAPS3's @CAPS4'. Though they are both considered 'bad' they are just expressions of the authors mind not intending to brainwash children or start a second civil war. The authors just had and innocent idea for a book and decided to put those ideas onto paper. The authors are just as innocent as everyone else even the protestors to their books.     This new age has brought the front of a changing planet. Connections between people are becoming faster and ideas can spread to a wider audience. This world also has new rules on what people are allowed to talk about. In the @ORGANIZATION1 it is every citizens right to have free speech without persecution. Some other countries have stricter laws than the @LOCATION1 yet are still less strict than they used to be. This new age has also brought about new forms of communication such as, video, text, phone call, internet, and many others. Today's literature has evolved into the digital realm. magazines, books, movies, and music are all now digital. The music today is a new genre and can contain lyrics that not everybody approves of. The artists are just expressing themselves through lyrics and rythm they are not trying to offend anybody. This music spreads to a larger audience around the world and thus causing a larger revolt against it. Today it is much harder to deal with the masses of people that have access to your creations. This can cause people to stop creating their work.      Why? Why extinguish this unknown talent just because some people didn't like it? Many people do not care they just want it gone. Killing this talent is like killing soemone for the color of their skin. It is just wrong. Artists today should not have to live in fear of how their media will be judged around the world. This media should not be destroyed it should be saved for future generations to watch, listen too, or read. That's how we learened about our past right? Why should we try and clean up the media to appease a few people and create the false illusion of a perfect world when there is no such thing. We can not clean up what has happened. We can only learn from it for a better understanding of our fellow man and create the better world we all dream of.      In conlcusion, I think that there is not justifiable reason to abtain the future from learning from the past. We can create our future and we can know what has happened so it doesn;t happen again. Society and the world has changed and all of us need to change with it so that creators of media can do so without fear of what might happen and be able to know that it will be accepted and treasrued for all to see now and in the future",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"Have you ever gone to library and asked for a book that they do not have? I know that I have, and that is not fun. Where else do you look? I believe that libraries should not take away books just because they are offensive to some people. We have so much diversity in this great country that almost anything could be offensive to someone.      First of all, writing is our history. It is an insight of how people think, and act in our culture. How do we know about the @CAPS1 empire, and other past cultures? We have learned about them through different writings. If every single library discarded 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3,' because of one word that is used in the book, then that is one less example of how that period of our history was. We need all of the literature to stay acsessable so that we can keep our history, and our country has a special place in history also.     Second of all, the law protects us from the discarding of literature solely beacuse of what is said in it. Libraries are funded by the goverment, so they must set an example of how the law is supposed to work. In the constitution it says that we have freedom of speech. That means I can say whatever I want, and I can not be punished. It is the same way for literature also. Nobody can stop authors from writing what they think, and the libraries need to embrace that, and have a variety of literature. One @MONTH1 not agree with what that piece of literature is portraying, but that does not mean that they can limit it to the consumers because of one's opinion.     Third, there is nobody that is going to make you read what you think is offensive. There are instances where you will be better of if you do see, or read what you do not agree with, but there is nobody forcing you. In school we had to read 'To @CAPS2 a @CAPS3,' which had some offensive language in it, but nobody made you read it. You would be absolutely better if you did read it, but you did not have to. So you are able to avoid it, but it would be very hard to. If you did end up reading, seeing, hearing something that you find offensive, then be mature about it. Just because someone else has a differing opinion does not mean that they are wrong, and you are right.     So there are many way around this problem of offensive literature. Libraries could catagorize what is more offensive and put that into certain areas, that way people can avoid those certain areas if they are offended easily. There could also be written warnings on the covers of literature warning of offensive content. So in my opinion libraries should not discard of certain literature because of its offensiveness. It is our history and we need to preserve it, we have the freedom of speech, and nobody is forcing you to look at it.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"The Censorship of Children      I can see how censorship is an important issue.  Some people including parents and other adults would think many subjects matters should not be read by young children.  There are many views in the world today about personal opinions on every subject you could possibly think of.  I can understand how some things should be restricted from children.  There are things also I think that children should know more about and be exposed to.       On the subject matter of children being restricted from certain things, I respect their opinion.  I certainly do believe that certain particular things pertaining to sex, drugs, and abusive material should be kept from children until a certain age.  Young children should be honestly protected from some of the gruesom facts of life.  Drugs and sex should be kept away until what the parent and/or guardian considers and appropriate age for the child.  So, until the child turns into a young adult, I beleive that some things should just stay hidden.        I believe that on subjects such as history, science, health, and war that people should be informed.  Those particular things should not be kept away from children.  They are the hard facts of our lifes today and it all should be known.  Some people think that the conversation of war should be secretive and kept away from children, but the honest truth is that they need to know what is going on in the world today.  I think that everyone should know what is going on in our everyday lives and what people are risking for our freedom every single day.     I believe that you just can't keep children from music.  It is in all of us and they will express themselves through it and I think they should.  Wherever you go you will have music all over the place, so I believe you should just let it be and let them express themselves through that.  On the subject of movies, if libraries have problems with children watching inappropriate movies, then they should just let only adults check out their movies.  I think that either way they will find some way to watch all those undesired movies.       So, on all of the subjects we have talked about today, people will always have their own opinion on all of these things.  I think that there are honestly a lot of things that are inappropriate for a lot of people to read or see, but some of it they should definitely be exposed to. War should definitely be one of those subjects people be exposed to.  People are dieing for us everyday, so we should know more about it.  So, I do honestly believe that some things should be protected from children, but other things such as music and war should be exposed to them.  Some of the facts of life need to be known and I think we should be the ones to tell them",3.0,3.0,4.0

If you have a problem with it then write a letter to the maker and publisher of the item. Ask for an appolagy for what ever is offensive to you and or the public.     I don't think just one person should be able to take something off the shelves. What if someone else doesn't find it offensive and wants to read it? Then they can't. They might want to buy it and add it to a collection of that author they might have.     I don't think anything should be removed from shelves if its a book, music, or magazine because it might be wanted by someone. Just because a few people might find it offensive, they shouldn't read or listen or watch it because others might want to listen, read, or watch it. If something is offensive to you, then don't have anything to do with it, just igore it. Pretend it was never made or produced. If someone ask about it, then say you don't care about it becuase it is offensive to you.     What gives you the right to take away another persons right to do something they want to do? I think if it was offensive the publisher would of made the writer change it. I don't believe anyone should have the right to take away another persons right to do something. If you hear offensive music then shut it off. If you watch something offensive then walk away or shut it off. If your reading something and it is offensive then stop reading it.

2,"Do you want your young kids reading books with prophanity, inappropiate sayings, or looking at books with some bad pictures in it? Most parents would say no but some of them can't handle all that because libraries have those kind of books that little kids can get a hold of and read it! Even some books in the kid section are bad for them to read. Some books @MONTH1 have violence and bad words and the kids absorb all that information and think nothing of it, some kids don't even know what they are reading is worng.      To help with that problem libraries should get rid of the books that are like a virus for a kids brain and development because all the kids do is wht they learn and are exposed to. Because of that a bunch of kids have been going the rong way and have been doing drugs, being sexually active, and much more because they might of seen it in a book or something and thought it might be ok to do.     A library shoould be a place where the kids can learn the right stuff and get the right knowledge and not be exposed to all the bad things and the little kid sections she only be educational books and the grade school and middle school books shouldn't be as violent and bad. Like the books kids read for fun should not have all the terrible stuff in it because the kids might want to try it and that would get them seriously injured or maybe even killed.      Now the science books that have some pictures in it should only be shown to the teens that can handle it and won't make jokes or any of that. The science books should also have so e limits of what they put in there and should not be around any kids that could get a hold of it and and @MONTH1 start trouble. So those types of books should only be kept in schools where they are used for educational purposes and maybe in a library far away from the kids so they wouldn't have a chance to see it and the people that need it for educational purposes can use them.     So in libraries the books she be watchesd where they are placed and watch what they have in them and be watched so no kids can get ahold of them.

There is no such thing as partial freedom, and any form of censorship restricts an individuals ability to make their own decisions. If citizens can not make the correct decisions the system would not be able to work. It becomes more difficult to experience unique  material as well. This means that there will be less new and inovative ideas to improve society. Censorship would promote stagnant thought and a less interesting culture.     Individuals who enjoyed the restricted material would feel angry because they would not be able to indulge in their passion. They @MONTH1 also feel that they themselves are being restricted. It would become difficult for them to express similar interest because it to would be censored. Art would become boring because of the lack of unique ideas. Many people would not try to create because what they would want to make would be censored.     It would no longer be possible to make the decision to avoid the restricted content. Individuals who advocate censorship must believe that society can not handle the responsibility of making their own decisions. These people must prefer ignorant comfort to the dangers of creativity.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I think that some libraries should watch what they put in what sections. An adult anatomy book for example, should not be in a first graders hands. Some parents @MONTH1 think thats okay, but others dont want their seven-year-old child looking at body parts that they arent ready to see.     When I was in the seventh grade, I was in a library around town and found a book about sex on the bookshelf for second graders. If I was a parent, I would not want my child looking at a book like that, especially at that age. It could have been misplaced, but the librarian needs to watch for that kind of stuff.     There also is another way to look at it though. Lets just say you didnt believe in slavery, and you went to the library twice a week to see what kind of lives @CAPS1 @CAPS2 lived everyday. Then, one day, while your in there reading, some rude white man yanked it out of your hands and said, 'I believe in slavery, and that offends me, get it out of here!' You'd find yourself pretty angry, especially if you were just looking back on @CAPS3 history.     I think that the librarians just need to catagorize things a little better, so if people dont like the @CAPS4 religion, then they dont have to go into that section. If they enjoy reading about something, then they should be able to read it peacefully. About the 'second grade sex book', that was just not right. A second grader cannot be seeing that. It's what the adults need to do. Watch your children at libraries, and dont put a sex book on a second grade shelf. I think adults have the right to read what they want, they just need to watch what they are doing and who they are 'offending'",3.0,3.0,4.0

At the age of @NUM1, I went to the library to get a book to read, I found my self between all these books, most of them were really interesting, and it was because of the material they had, they were base onhistory, science, and nature... I also found books that talked about race in bad lenguage(absurdity).A lot of the books said they were only for people over the age of @NUM2...I wanted to see if I could get this kind of books, so I went up to the woman at the front desk. I told her I wanted to read those books,she saw the stamp(it said,only for people over the age of @NUM2) she looked at me.'@CAPS1 ahead' she said.'thank you' I said back. I though she was goin to say something like-you have to be @NUM2-but she did not.      During that time I was still a child, and it was so easy to get that kind of material.When you read all this material, you mind gets full of this discrimination against other races and nonsense.That is not the right way to receice an education durind your childhood.

2,"The world is full of controversy. Everyone has a different view on different things. Now people are complaining about what is on the shelves at the library. The truth is everyone gets offended. You can't make everyone happy at the same time. There is also nothing anyone can do to help stop disagreements over stupid things. It is the people at the library who decide what is put on the shelves. We cannot please everyone and the people that have problems with whats on the shelf should stay away from it and forget that it's even there.     Someone somewhere is offended by something. Everyone around the world is different and has a different view. What is done around the world is done to make the general public happy. Now does that mean everyone will be happy? No, not everyone is happy. The smallest thing can make someone unhappy and they make others suffer as well. However who ever is offended by the material should suggest to the librarian to have it relocated to an area where there aren't children. When kids are young they catch on to a lot of things very quickly. They should make different sections in a library, like a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section, as well as a family section. That would be best to stop the complaining     The books, movies, magazines, and music are there for all different types of people to check out. Just because it's not right to you doesn't mean it needs to be removed. Something someone finds offensive could be someone elses favorite. And its not fair to take that away just because it offends one person. If the workers at the library find it @CAPS1.K. to put it on the shelf at their job then it should be fine for people to see. If what is at a certain library you don't like, then go find a new one that fits your liking.       People can try to change what is put on the shelf, but what they don't realize is what if their favorite book or movie offends someone else? They don't care about other people, all they see is that they don't have to see that cover again. Thats not fair to everyone who checks things out at the library. There is nothing anyone can do about people being unhappy, it happens all the time.      The world is tough to live in. Not everyone can always be happy. What should be the most important thing should be schools and jobs, not what is put on the shelves at the library. That @MONTH1 be important to some people but it shouldn't be the very first priority. I believe the library should stay the way it is and not worrying about who it offends.

2,"To @PERSON1, yes some books, music, movies and,  magazines should be removed from libraries, if there somthing thats not readable for young children.I personal think things like that shouln't be in the children section at all. Because some young children would @CAPS2 pick up any book and read it and, that mean the workers don't don't do there job completely.      Some music @CAPS1't be in the libraries, at all because some music have slang , or cursing.Young children @CAPS1't grow up listening to that type of music like raping , r&b. I think thats not a good start off for young children. They @MONTH1 grow up talking like there grown, or maybe talking back to others.       It @CAPS1't never be a movie thats not for a young children watch in  there section.Thats why the parents should always, at all times be by there children watching them pick out a movies.If not then they wouldn't know what there child picking out or watching.Or maybe the parent can pick out some movies and, then ask there child  which one of the movies they would like.        Magazines have things in there that young children shouldnt see, @CAPS2 like other books  thats in the libraries. Young children could grow up to fast looking, listening and, seeing the things thats not allowed for them. Some parents need to have control over there child, because some children have control over there parents and, thats how young children would grow up.          Books, music, movies and, magazines are bad young children some times. Its a bad inflence on there life. So I hope alot of children learn from this whenever they go to a library.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"We all have our own opinons. Some like comedies, while others @MONTH1 like science fiction. Some like romance, while others @MONTH1 like scary books. However, when does it come to a point when someone's opinion of a book, magazine, or music is taken too far? Censorship in many libraries and schools is being taken too far and the authors and artists that are censored need to speak up.     Censorship has been around for awhile. People have been censoring movies, books, and magazines since they started making them. The fact is, is that this isn't right. People pour hours upon hours into creating entertainment for the public, only to be taken off the shelf and put in a box for storage. Books and movies normally say what age category is appropriate for that particular item, so libraries shouldn't be taking them off the shelves so children won't watch them.      Lately libraries and schools have tightened up their rules for what should stay and what should go. They censor children books for little things like children not listening to their parents or doing something they shouldn't. These books shouldn't be censored.      Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have take off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that book I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson was saying that everyone has a book that they don't like and they @MONTH1 not want they're child reading, but if everyone takes away those books, and we keep censoring them, then we're not going to have much left to read. We're going to take away the literature from the children that haven't had the chance to read it yet.     Censorship has been a problem for awhile and is still a problem today. Books, magazines, and music are being taken away, unread, and unheard. But if we speak up we can stop the libraries and schools from censoring these items by telling them that we want to read them, and want to hear them!",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Many people believe that books should be removed from the library shelves if material they contain are found offensive. @CAPS3 material could range anywhere from a statement, an action in the story, a portrayal, or even a word. There are many books out there that contain material like @CAPS3. However, there is always more than one opinion to every argument. Should these books that are found offensive be censored, be left alone, or removed completely?     One book that has risen a conflict over the past years is the old novel, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book is found offensive because @CAPS8 uses a word that @DATE1 is taken negatively: the n-word, or as you @MONTH1 know @CAPS8, 'nigger.' The n-word is a word that is offensive to most of the modern @CAPS4 @CAPS5 society. Back in the days of @PERSON1, the author of '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' the n-word was practically a harmless way of saying one was as one @MONTH1 call them @DATE1, 'black.' @CAPS8 was just a normal gesture to people back then.     Although, there are people @DATE1 that believe that censoring these kinds of words in literature is neccessary. They believe that replacing these words with words such as '@CAPS9,' would be a better option. In my opinion, I think people just need to be better educated on what these words meant to the people in @LOCATION1's era. They need to be taught that not all people back then used them in a negative fashion. Some did, but there isn't one race that isn't or hasn't been gone against for what they are or were in the past. Everyone is going to be offended some point in his or her life, so why go through all that trouble just to make one small group of people feel better?      Since the n-word was normal for people then, changing the word to '@CAPS9' would not do much help. '@CAPS9' was hardly ever taken positively back then, unless you were a free man. In fact, '@CAPS9' was, and still is @DATE1, a more negatively taken word than the word 'nigger.' The way people used these words -such a the n-word- is just a part of history.      History can not be changed, and should not be changed. @CAPS8 needs to be appreciated for the way @CAPS8 was and how @CAPS8 happened. We can not change the way things happened in the @CAPS10 @CAPS11 nor the @CAPS12, so why should people be allowed to censor the way people in the past used to speak and communicate with one another? By erasing these things from our story books and replacing them with words such as '@CAPS9,' how are we going to be able to teach future generations about how the way of life was many years ago? If we begin censoring, things in our literature @DATE1 a few people @MONTH1 consider 'offensive' material, will be forgotten over time, and people are going to wonder what life was like back in the days of @PERSON1.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In the topic of censorship in libraries, I believe that libraries should have all types of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. They should not take things of the shelves because it is offensicve to some people. Here are my reason's why.     My first reason, is some people like comedy's so they get something that makes them laugh, other people like non-fiction books so they get a book thats non-fiction, but those two different people @MONTH1 not like what the others are reading so they stick to what they like. It doesnt mean they have to take every thing they dont agree with off the shelves they can just stay away from the sections they dont like.      My second reason is, if  someone come's in and look's for a book, @CAPS1, or a movie and the library does not have it because someone before that thought it was affensive and it was taken of the shelves, that one person or that @NUM1 people cant get what they were looking for and now they're are missing out on something that was made for anyone to watch, listen to, or read.     My third and last reason is, ive read alot of different books, listened to all different music, and watched all different types of movies and ive done those things with alot of different people. your always going to have one person not like it and think its offensive but next to you there's @NUM2 people who do like it. everyone can't agree on everything.

2,"Books, magazines, music, movies are these things affecting and or setting a bad example for our youth? Most liraries including those in schools, have books and Magazines that are highly inapropriate for young children and teenagers. The books that are being distributed have contents for adults. They talk about sex and drugs and much more, and these are the books and magazines being put out for our children, our youth to read? Unacceptable!     Being in high school I read a lot of books. Some are not even appropriate for my age level. I've read just about every kind of book that there is to read. Thinking to myself one day I asked myself 'would I want my children to read books and or magazines like this when they are of the age I am now', and my answer was no I wouldnt want my children to read these things.  Because it gives them idea's, and currupts their minds, and in other words giving them a thought that makes them think that it is ok to do those things they find themselve's reading about in those same type of books I've once read.     Movies now a days are getting way worst then befor. Movies are now cooming out with way more sexual content, gang violance, and drugs. If we allow our chilren to watch these movies then we might as well let them take care of themselve's. Little do you know after while they are going to want to be like characters they see in the movies, doing what they see them do, and trying to live the type of lives that they see on t.v.     Music that is being put out in the world these days are just like movie's in a way. The lyrics are explicite, and the message being put out is in a way brainwashing our youth.

It @MONTH1 come to a surprise or it @MONTH1 not that I see lot's of children and teen's trying to act like the music aritst's that they idolize. I've seen it all people dressing like them, getting their hair done like them, talking like them, acting like them, trying to do what they see them doing. Honestly thats not good. That start's gang violance, drug dealing, sex, teenage preagnacy, disrespect twards parents, and much more. My children might end up doing what they see on t.v. or read in books, and magazines or see in movies and listen to in music. Thats not something I want for them.

2,"I believe that libraries have the right to display whatever type of material they choose to put out. All sorts of people with different interests go to libraries to read and borrow books. They shouldn't be restricted as to what they are reading or watching, no matter the content. The library should be allowed to display just about anything to a certain extent.     When it comes to this, my first thought is the children. I feel that inappropriate content should be put away from all of the kids. If libraries decide to have offensive material on display, it should be kept separetly, just like children's books. You don't find many adults wondering through the children's section. Some adults might even have to ask for the specific literature. Obviously if something is questioning censorship, it shouldn't be out in the open for children to see.     If this specific literature is needed by a student for example, they should have to bring a parent in with permission to borrow it. Some students @MONTH1 need this for a project or even use it to read up on something of their interest.     In my opinion, I think it's perfectly fine for libraries to select what they want to lend out to others. Many people with different interests, jobs, and hobbies all enjoy to read. It's not fair to limit and restrict their choice of entertainment. I feel as long as offensive literature is put away from the children there should not be a problem. How would you like it if someone said you weren't allowed to read your favorite @CAPS1 book?

2,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,@CAPS1 has been some question on if 'offensive' material should be taken off the shelves of libraries. In my opinion, i don't think that someone should have to take certain books off the shelf just because it @MONTH1 not be appropriate for a certain person. @CAPS1 are smut novels that are not age appropriate for children, but they don't have to check them out if they don't want to. You can always research and find out what a book is about before you read it. @CAPS1 are men and woman in the world that are very interested or entertained by books that @MONTH1 not be up to standard in what appropriate is. In college, or even high school, you  have to do reading assignments and book essay. Every book that you read won't be fit to please everyone. @CAPS1 are classics that are argued today for being inappropriate for some of the language or content used, but it is a classic and that was the language back then. I had to read To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3 in school, and today they want to get the story rewritten to exclude the use of the word nigger. It is a word that is still used and it is a word that can be used to be hate filled, but in those @ORGANIZATION1, that is how the world spoke. I do think that @CAPS1 should be an age limit on some books, just like movies are rated. If it is a book that someone feels isn't fit for a certain age group, then maybe they should give restrictions. In movie stories, they have things placed in a certain part of the story. Children movies, movies for all ages, and adult films. If a store has issues with the content a book contains and the age group it targets, then they should take the responsibility of setting sections for different books. Books shouldn't have to be taken off the shelf just because some people don't like it or it's message. @CAPS1 are classics that everyone has grown up with, and it wouldn't be fair to take them out for upcoming generations.

2,"I believe that certain things should be censored in libraries, however, not all things that are found offensive by people.  There are many different religions and belief systems in this world and if we catered to all of them then there would be very little literature for people to choose from and they would miss out on many great things.     Books should not have a very strict censorship.  There should be certain rules that they have to meet but if you are really strict with books people would miss out on some of the best novels ever written.  One very good story that could be seen as offensive by someone is 'The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3'.  This story includes slaves, cussing, slang, and killing but it is one of the best books I have ever read.  Just because there were those certain topics doesn't mean it changed my views on any of them.  The things said and done in that book were acceptable in society back then and it gives us a look back into the lives of people before us.  It gives us a story from someone elses point of view while opening our eyes to new things.     Music, I believe, should be censored more harshly than books.  Not all types of music are bad but some are not good for people.   I feel this way because alot of rap music these days promotes harshness towards women, sex, drugs, and alcohol, but rap is not the only type that does that.  If I were a parent I wouldn't want my child going to the library and listening to that type of thing.  If they would have those kinds of music that were more harsh they should separate it from the more appropriate music and let only adults access it.     I feel that movies should be in the same boat as music.  I am fine with everyone being able to get all @CAPS4 through @NUM1 movies but in my opinion, if a movie is rated @CAPS5 a non adult would have to have a parent or adult with them to rent it.  However, the section of @CAPS5 rated movies shouldn't contian nudity because I feel that promotes sex and pornography.     All magazines that don't have nudity or drugs in them, I believe, should be able to be rented at a library.  I don't see magazines posing a very big threat to someone's morals because they are already censored to an extent before they are put on shelves.

Libraries are  places of freedom. Taking away certain books, music, movies, etc., in libraries would disappoint a huge ammount of people.     In libraries, your job as a parent is to tell your kids not to go in areas where they shouldn't go. When I was younger, my mom and dad always gave me bounderies as to where I could go, and where I couldn't go. Libraries are for all ages of people, not just children. Therfore, all types of books, magazines, movies, and music shouldn't be censored.     An observation of mine, is that, if people gave bounderies as to where their children are and are not aloud to go in certain areas, then this wouldn't even be a concering problem. I understand the worries of a child getting there hands on a book with violence or something scary, but then all of this bounces back to an earlier statment as to bounderies.     So, in my conclusion, I think it's safe to keep all types of books, music, movies, etc., on the shelfs at the libraries.

If i were to change some things around it would be to first create a new library and put the books in it that i would want my children and other people children to be reading and if they didn't like the changes that i was making then they could just go to a different library because i would be trying to get people to read positive books and not negative books. They are also making books that have alot of foul languages in them and that's where it all starts for little kids because when the kids read them books they think it's okay to curse and they just start saying what they want to when they want to say so that would be the next thing that i would take away because i would want them to be growing up living a bad life style because that's how it all starts and i also would give them books that was talking about drugs because that's how most people mess their lives is because of drugs because they want to be cool and hang with the cool kids but your not surposed to do something you see someone else doing if you see them doing it and they offer it to you just say no thank you and walk away you don't have to stay there in that environment because you are not being forced to do nothing so if you have a problem you with something that happens around you you tell that person you don't do that and your not trying to get involved in that stuff and if they get mad and start calling you names just walk away you did what you were surposed to do so in the long run keep your head up and do what's right for you.,3.0,3.0,4.0

I mainly understand music and movies but not so much books and magazines. music and movies can have language or gore and such that a child should not hear and can be a little mind numbing. With books and magazines though they show what was going on during that time and are a little piece of history and to censor books is to kill a little bit of history.      It is also someones hard work you are trying to throw away. I feel like if a child reads a book they will understand history more and will gain knowledge.

2,"To the concerns of those who wished the libraries would be censored, I believe the rights of picking out your own book is great but the young children should have certain books they are able to read. The kids today in our society are exposed to many bad behaviors, in which they should never have to deal with until a later age. Some of the books in the libraries have a reading level set on them for a reason. The children should not be able to read about books, in which teach them dreadful behaviors.     An experience of my own was when I picked out one of the @ORGANIZATION1 books. I came home with this book not because I was interested in reading the book, but because I knew if I read this book and took the accelerated reading test on it I knew I would have met the required amount of points for the nine weeks. My mother entered the room I was reading in and asked for the title of my book. She heard the title and immediately told me the book had to be brought back to the library in the @TIME1. My mother explained to me the book was not a good book for our religion, because of all the mystical creatures within the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 book.     The library has many other books to choose from, the librarians do not have to order the books inappropriate or offensive to people. I am sure there are plenty of other books that are clean minded and unoffensive. The world needs to stay away from the 'bad books' that influence people to do unsafe behaviors. All books that can hurt people in anyway should be banned from the shelves of the libraries. If you want to read the 'bad books', you should have to purchase them on your own. Why waste the money when all it will do is offend or teach the people bad behaviors, which could hurt the community in the long run.     The banning of certain materials in libraries is probably one of the best ideas I have heard in a while. The world needs to stop offending people and stop all of the bad behaviors going on. I have read a few books in which I think should be banned, the world can act now and promote the banning of 'bad books' in the libraries. If you could help out step by step in making the world a better place to live in, would you do it? This is a baby step to making a difference in the world, even though this does not seem like a big deal, if the people did not read these bad materials then they would less likely be able to think of doing the bad behaiors. Let us try to stay away from the books that leave bad influences and read the materials that do not offend anyone or helps you to become a kind, loving person",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"As a human being, I have the right to take in knowledge that I can apply later in my life, as does any other living person. A person should not be able to take the oppertunity to experince a graphic situation in a safe enviroment away from another. A library is a place that contains a large mass of stories whether they are fiction or non, and within the many stories some material @MONTH1 be thought too graphic for a young child, even young adults. This graphic material is neccesary for ones developement. If a child were to live a life censored from the harsh enviorment of the @CAPS2 as it truly is, then the child, after coming of age, would eventually enter the @CAPS2 with no preparation for the harsh enviorment it it will be placed in. A few examples, as I will explain further, are: books of @CAPS2 history, fictional books of a person's real life situation, and books thatwould create new ideas in one's growing mind.    The past cannot be completely told without dwelling into the dark half of it. If one were raised in veiwing our @CAPS2's history as simple conquests of country and man, then they would be blind to the desperation some men can reach. An example; @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the @CAPS5 @PERSON1, along with the @CAPS6 power, began a campaign to take over most of @LOCATION1. That is the lighter side of the @CAPS3 with @LOCATION3. If a child were only presented with this information, censored of the horrible things that had taken place, then the child will not know of the genocide of the @CAPS7 population, or of the massive nuclear bombing of @CAPS8, or even of the bombing of @LOCATION2 that had brought @LOCATION4 into the @CAPS3. Sure, a child @MONTH1 have a small metion of it as they learn history, but what if said child were to want to know more? If the library were to have censored their collection, then the child would would only get the information he had already been presented with. One @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS9 does it matter if a child would recieve the full explaination of what had truly happened on those events?' The answer is simple; the past can be repeated if we do not learn from our mistakes.   A library @MONTH1 not see the need for books that contain graphic situations such as one that @MONTH1 contain drugs, sex, violence, or mental illnesses, but in my opinion, these books are neccesary to let a young adult develope a sense for dealing with these situations. We, as humans, cannot deny that the @CAPS2 is filled with these things. It would be wise to allow our children to dwell into the books that will let them experience the situations in a safe enviroment, without them actually going into the @CAPS2 and experiencing it first hand. A person endangers a child when they raise them without letting them experience these things in a safe enviroment, for the real @CAPS2 is harsh. Therefore, it is neccesary for the library to stock books needed to teach the growing community.    It is neccesary for a young adult to create their own opinions on graphic subjects. If a person were to grow up without seeing the both the darker and a lighter side of life then they @MONTH1 not have the ability to form their own moral values. One who does not recognize wrong doings as something that is bad is liable to fall under the corruption evil thoughts @MONTH1 bring. When raising ones child, a person should present the dark side of life to them and teach them the morals of life. Explain to the young that what evil that has happened in the past should not be done again. A library would be a valueble recource in the teaching of these moral values in the education of child, but if a library were censored, the child would not have past experiences to learn from.     Many of my arguements presented are from things that have been said once before, such as; learning from our mistakes in the past so they @MONTH1 not happen in the future, taking the lesser of two evils or even staying on the safer side when teaching a young one the evils of life, and teaching right from wrong to a child before they can incidently develope a corrupt opinion for themselves. In conclusion, I state that a library without censorship is neccesary for the teachings of children. Everyone has the right to see the @CAPS2 as it truly is, uncensored and corrupt. My only wish is for them to learn of the @CAPS2 in a safe enviroment such as a library.",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"Censorship taking off the selfs at the local libraries and the local stores? The answer to that should be NO! If you turn that statement around and just think about it. Censorship should be tought to every kid that goes through school. If you didnt teach any students on how,why its use you would have alot of people mad at you. There are to many thing wrong with this world to be worried about censorship. Censorship revolves around this world day after day. The people you talk to and and the people you see walking down the side walk delt with this problem in a few ways.      I once took an afensive act from someone who said that the blacks should go back to africa. I had a violent answer to that when that person said that. I told him if their wasnt so many white people being lazy and wont get a job,that there wouldnt be a african american controling the united states. He took that and rethought that in his head that their was nothing for him say.         That paragraph is a first person veiw on how it should been taken But if you thought about it on a younger adault that hasnt learned censorship,how would that takened it how would that person response to it.     In conclusion to end this mess, is to teach younger kids the real life thats going to hit them. Tell them that they are going to have do things that their not going to like. I wake up every day with a smile and say this is going to be a great day,not knowing whats coming at me duting the day.

2,"Cenorship is a key thing and always has beeen.         My view on censorship in libraries is very legit I personally think that it is a good idea. Do I believe that certain materials that are offensive and or inappropriate be removed from shelves yes.Why do i think that inappropriate and or oofensive materials should be taken off of library shelves well keep reading and you will find out.The reason i think that they should be removed is because nobody wants their eleven year old child coming home with a book that only adults are suppose to read. When that eleven year old child comes home knowing stuff that she should not know is where we should draw the line. The nasty magazines and @CAPS1's books and movies, that have girls showing their bodies off sends off a bad vibe to the younger generation.The generation now days copies almost everything the media says or does. If their is a model who is way to skinny and she is a role model to some kids they will try and lead by her example and then they end up getting sick.How bout a famous rapper that does drugs and nothin but trash talk comes out of his mouth the young generation that listens to him will try and be like him and thats why our generation is the way it is and why the young ones are being locked up or killed.Do you want your tweleve year old daughter coming home from school talking about her boyfriend gave her a hickey? No, I personally don't know one parent that wants that. The message we are sending to these kids is horrible the books and magazines that have fantasies of kids having sex in high school and getting married and pregnant at sixteen is ridiculous no kid needs to read something like that but when your child reads that they are going to want to do the same thing that book is saying because thats how this generation is. The music is ridiculous these rappers who make money rapping about sex,money,drugs,and hustlin is what motivates our young generation to do and act the way they do today and that is why they are getting killed and gang banging and getting locked up.This concludes why i think that books magazines music...ETC should be removed from library book shelves.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Do I think that some books should be taken off the shelfs because they are offensive.           No because everyone have different oppionions and different views on what they should have in libaries. A libary is where you go to find out information on anything in the world no matter what it is. Some of the books and magazines and movies are not for young viewers because of them being to reveling.     I thinks that some books should not be for young viewers but they should be watched in a libary of books so they dont pick up books for older adults.      What I think about the music people lisen to is that everyone can choose what music they can lisen to they dont have to lisen to what anyone else likes to lisen to.            What I think about the magazines that are in the libraries is  yes some should not be aloud to be on the shelfs but some magazines are helpful to the world to let people know about whats going on in the world because some people dont like to read books they like to look at magazines.       Everyone has oppinions on what books are good and what books are bad what books should not be on the shelfs and what books should, but I look at it this way we got to learn stuff some how so why not in a libary.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Is there a right or wrong thing to read, listen to, or watch? Many people think that if there is something bad in the book, movie, or on the radio then we should stop what we're doing, and go on to something else. But why would we want to do that if we're enjoying it?     All people like to read what they want to read, whether its a book, or a magazine. There might be some bad things in the them, but if you don't like the book, or magazine, then take it back to the library or wherever you got it from, and get a different one. If you don't like the book or magazine, then someone else might. Not everyone is the same, and not everyone has the same taste in books.      If you are offended in any way, then take it back. That's really all you can do. If the story or song or whatever it is, is so offensive, then ask someone if there is something you can do about it of it's that bad. If there isnt, then you'll just have to get over it and move on. We all have our own oppinion.      Is there really anything out there that is too offensive to remove from the shelves? Personally, I don't think so. I have never read or listened to anything that is really that offensive. People around me never talk about anything being offensive. If people think something is offensive to them, I want to see it and see if it's bad myself.     My belief is that we shouldn't remove it from shelves. It's pretty much like art. If you love it then you're going to create it. People have ideas about so many things, so therefore they're going to create it, and make it come alive! So if you don't like it, then get over it.

2,"Would you like for someone to take a book off the shelve that you liked but the people that work in the libary thought was offensive?

We live in a world with negative things. So why would you remove something that @MONTH1 teach you a lesson help you too learn something.     They shouldnt remove @CAPS1 offensive books from shelves because they are a source of learning and willl @MONTH1 help you be a better person. Say if its a book with drugs achol and it has pictures of what you will look like if you do drugs and how it efects your life that could be offensive to people that do thoes things but also could be influenctial to people who are reading the book.

Have you ever watched a movie and it offended you? Like some of @CAPS1 old movies about slaverly and things it doesnt offend me but it maybe offesive to sum of our grandparents. But those type of movies could also have a bad effect on someone instead of a good one     @CAPS1 are just some ways offensive books and movies etc could impact a persons life.

2,"Why should libraries take books that are offensive off of the shelf when people watch the same things on television too? I go to the library all of the time and if the book I wanted wasn't on the shelf because a overprotected parent thought that it was too offensive I would be a little upset. Taking a book away from a library is like taking someone away from their home just because they did something wrong or used a bad word. I think that libraries shouldn't be able to censor their books because all parents have different restriction's on their children. Not only that, at least they are sitting down and reading instead of having their eyes glued to a television I think that libraries should put certain markers on certain books so parent's know what kind of book's their child is getting. If people griped about half of the things that are offensive on television we wouldn't have any shows left on television because I know that my parent's find half of the things on television offensive.     If you are so worried about what your child is reading maybe you should look the book up and see if it is offensive to you and then decide whether you should let your child read it or not. Which, is way better than, taking that book away from everybody else that uses that library. If libraries pulled every book off of the shelf that was offensive to a certain person in any kind of way I think that the only books we would have left in libraries are nonfiction books and some childrens books. In that case, you are taking away from others just because you think that the book you were reading is too offensive for you or your children to read.      Libraries should put certain markers on books that the parent's might want to know what is in them. Or they could put them in a certain area. Better yet, they could put age restrictions on certain books that have adult content in them so that way their parents definately know what kind of books their child is getting. But taking them away to me that is going a little bit too far with the whole thing. If you don't want your child reading it tell them no and move on. In the end the only thing that you are doing is taking away from the other people who wanted to read that book. Libraries are suppost to have all kinds of books not just the books that certain people think are appropriate. It's just not fair to everyone else who is using that library.     In that case, I think that libraries should not be able to pull books off of the shelves.

So why take that type of enjoyment from us because there is a couple of people that do not like those type of books and ect. You don't have to take them out of the library just give those types of books and magazines their own section with an authorized personal to check the age of the person entering that zone.

There should be some type pf parental lock on those @NUM1 movies for those that are not of age yet. No child under the age of @NUM2 should be able to check out @NUM1 books, magazines, movies, and ect. There sholud be soem type of card that says that they enter that part of the library.

2,"When you go to the library, what do you expect to see? Books,of course, would be the obvious answer. But what if all of the books that could be considered, in any minute way, offensive were to be taken off the shelf? Just about the only books left would be a handful of children's books and informative writing. Well, if left alone, this could be exactly what happens to public outlets everywhere, even though the positive aspects of these media sources far outweigh the negative or 'offensive' features.     To begin with, I'd like to point out that only a small portion of books are considered 'kid-friendly.' @CAPS1 is this? Well, it's mostly due to the fact that the vast majority of readers are mature adults, so respectively the books have more mature content. If we were to remove a book because someone not old enough or mature enough doesn't like what they're reading, then libraries would have to get rid of all of the books. There are simply too many 'offensive' topics in the world to write an entire book without hitting a single one of them.     Another good reason libraries should remain uncensored is because even the greatest of books have just a hint of vulgarity, obscene behavior, or offensive jargon. However, this doesn't affect the book's ability to be well-liked by the readers. In fact, sometimes this is what makes books enjoyable. It should be common knowledge that in today's society you don't see people conversing with one another as if they were college professors, so when a book adds something familiar (and this would probably be something vulgar or obscene) into their novel, it grabs the reader's attention. Also, any good author wants the reader to be able to see eye-to-eye with the main character, and since no one's life is perfect, there's bound to be something 'offensive' to someone in the text. As it was mentioned earlier, there's just too much to avoid to make a book tolerable by everyone.     Finally, the last reason censorship should not be allowed is because that, by nature, humans have a hard time resisting offensive or vulgar behavior, and it is reflected in their writing. Also, when it comes to movies, for instance, the old 'clean' style of movies has long since gotten stale. In these times, the only movies with a rating of @CAPS2 or lower are movies made by @ORGANIZATION1, or simply children's movies. Beyond that, every other movie that's directed towards an older audience has a lot of vulgarity and jargon. Song producers don't write songs that listeners don't want to listen to, and, unfortunately, most of what today's listeners want to hear is the vulgarity. As for magazine publishers, with all the things going on in the world today, what is there to write about that's both interesting AND clean?     To summarize, there really isn't any way to have a library with books full of completely tolerable material, because that simply doesn't exist. If libraries or any other social media outlet were to censor their products, there would be nothing left for anyone. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"All books, movies, magazines, and music have their own voice and opinion about them. To remove them from the shelves of libraries would be rude to the people trying to give voice to their opinions. Censorship in libraries is something that does not seem right. Books that people find offensive shouldn't be taken off the shelves becuase not everyone is the same; different people have different views. They also should not be taken off the shelves because that would cause even more trouble with the people that think they should stay on the shelves. Censorship in libraries should not be put into action because not all things are offensive to everyone; people should have their own views on things and it wold cause lots of outrage on both parties.     Every book has a voice; a specific way about them that everyone takes differently. No one person is the same, not everyone person has the same views on what is offensive and what is not offensive to them. To have censorship on libraries is like asking someone to take their scarf off at the park because someone thought it to be ugly. To the person wearing the scarf, it @MONTH1 not seem ugly, but to another it @MONTH1 disgust them. When having an opintion, it is only right, it seems, to have the right to be able to voice that and let people think what they @MONTH1.     If one were to think that having an opinion only brings trouble and another to say that even if a book states an opinion, it still has people burning with anger; think of it another way. If censorships on libraries were put into action, wouldn't it bring more bad than good? Of course, the books parents don't want their children to read or the extreme religious or political person wouldn't have to fret with their image in the general public, but than no one would care as much as they do now. People might get more angry than happy when they can't look at others opinions to choose what they want to think or even write their own opinion for others to have as a referance. Maybe it is better, in the long run, to have an opinion than to have it blown away like dust in the wind.     Every book, magazine, movie, song, or newspaper sometimes, has a voice and opinion about them. To remove them from the shelves of a library because some people do not think this is something that does not seem right. Everyone has their own opinion either to share or to state and having to hold that back because of other people who find that offensive also does not seem too right.

This kind of materials must be in certain kind of shelves, like in a @CAPS1, there is sections where you can find books, music, etc., and they are divided; for example, kids section, teenage section, and adults section. Some people is just concern about the fact that maybe their children will read it and learn the bad things that are found in that 'offensive' books, but parents must be very careful about what their children do, also a good teaching from the parents is a good way for the kids to know what are they doing, and they will know what they do in the future and if it is bad or not. Some materials are just bad, but some people still like it, maybe they feel identified with the thing that they are reading, listening, or watching.

Another example why I don't think they should get taken off is because if you trying to learn about something the librarie is a common place to go, to read about it. That also wouldn't be far to the other person.     Leaving them on shelfts,@CAPS1 example of why they should leave book that can cause offence to something is because, @CAPS2 kids are more advansed then others and would like to read about older stuff, which is usally okay.If you don't want your kid readnig that type of book, dont let them check it out, it shouldnt be taken away for anyone else. Another reason why I think they should be left on the shelfts is because if others are going to get offended by something that people read, then just dont read it again. Other people might wanna know about it, and if they are taken off the shelfs it will be taken from them.     If people are getting that offensive over something, then they shouldnt be taken off the shelfts completely they should just be put on a seperate shelft, taken away from all the other books.

Another reason why they are okay to stay on the shelfts is because people can also learn from the pictures. They should just be kept clean.     @CAPS4's, I dont think @CAPS4's should be taken off either. @CAPS1 example why I don't think so, is because if they are blind how else are you going to be able to listen to the book. Another example of why @CAPS4's should stay on the shelft is because if you heard of a band and want to listen but dont want to buy it, you can go rent it.

2,"Books, music and movies, everybody likes books, people read them for fun or just to pass time. There are some books that I believe should not be taken off of shelf's for the simple fack that they are horible not in a scary way but just horible. Movies, music and books can be taken off the shelf and looked at and put right back after they have already been there for centries.      This classifies these books, movies and music as bad material, or people have lost intrest in them weather it is because they are about drugs, sex and alcohol. This being said nobody would want there ten year old kids going down to the library, kicking back and cracking these books or taking these tapes home to lisen to. Thinks like these are to be kept away from kids, this is the last thing we need kids running around with drugs or premaridle sex.     I believe that these books, movies and music should be taken off the shelfs and away from the public. If you wish to see these materials you shall ask only if you are of age. Eventually when kids get into high school or even college they will want to see the books they were prohibited from for years, this is ok. Being that these kids have grown up and are on the right path. They are not already brain washed by the narrator in these books, music and movies. They will know to do no such thing as drugs and other things that are pronounsed in these materials.

We usually know what kind of genre we are entertained by and we choose things in the same category, that doesn't mean you are forced to choose something that you don't want.         Secondly, some say children who go to the library are exposed to offensive books. Well, I say that those children know what their parents would or would not allow them to read. As a parent you should keep track of what your child is reading, watching, or listening to. If certain language or use of literature is against your beliefs then you should know what kind of music you like. For example, if you are a religious person who does not believe in volgure language I do not believe you are going to get a @CAPS1 by a rap singer. If you do not want your child exposed to nudity then I suggest that you look at the movies rating and see if it @NUM1 or @CAPS2-@CAPS3.     Lastly, certain groups of people do not find vulgure language, graphic content, or nudity offensive. They find certain genres interesting that others do not and that is their source of entertainment, why should their entertainment be taken away because of someone elses thoughts? Yes, some of the content is unappropriate to some but it is freedom of choice. Young children are not allowed to by movies that are @CAPS3 above their age levels. Parents are usually at stores with their children when they buy music, it is the job of the parent to monitor their child.     People in the @LOCATION1 have a choice on what they want to read, watch, or listen to and it is not a choice made by anyone else but, ones self. I do not agree with the fact that because you do not want your child to be exposed to certain information that everyone else that does want to be entertained by that information should be punished. Just because people do not agree with the use of alcoholic beverages, do they get banned from the shelves of stores? No, they don't because some people do like alcoholic beverages and not everyone suffers because the likings and dislikings of people.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are a few books in the library that some don't think highly of.  These books should stay in the library .  If you don't like a certain book, then don't read it.  @CAPS1 @MONTH1 not be a lot of people that like these books, but @CAPS1 are some people that are interested in these books.  Books that @MONTH1 not be quite suitable @MONTH1 be the kind of book that can help someone's views in life.       If you don't like to read books like these then @CAPS1 is no reason to get upset about it.  What you should do is just not pay attention to them and don't read them.  @CAPS1 is not a law or a person that can make you read a book that you truely are against.  If @CAPS1 is a book you look down on, then don't read it and then you won't have to worry about what  is in that book.  The best thing a person could do that truely dislikes such a book would be to forgit about it and read @CAPS1 kind of book.  Those people wouldn't think it was fair if they took away books that he or she liked.       Some people enjoy to read these books.  they look at them and it just fits their character.  It @MONTH1 show them how the real world is, and people @MONTH1 need to realize these things for their future.  Maybe someone in their family has acted a certain way and is bad now.  These people @MONTH1 want to read a book like this to maybe learn how to help their family member.            Other than just being an interest to some people, books like these can help people with their views on life.  These books can show them and make them realize that bad things and undesired things happen in life.  Reading a book @MONTH1 be the only help a person is comfotable with at the moment.       All books should stay in the library.  Sure @CAPS1 are some books that people really disagree with, but that doesn't mean we should get rid of them.

2,"There are some books that are thousands of years old.  These books were written in a different timeframe then what people live in today.  One of the most famous old books on shelves is the @ORGANIZATION1 and is one of the most popular selling books in the world.  Although the @ORGANIZATION1 is found offensive by people, they have not been removed from the shelves.  Libraries should not censor books, music, movies, and magazines.     The first reason why offensive material should not be removed is because every book would be absoulete.  Books are written on a variety of topics which someone would find offensive.  A book that is defined offensive is the opinion of someone.  There is no records to show that a certain book is the most offensive, it is just someone's opinion.  A few people would find a child's book offensive because it is mindwashing the child.  All the reasons people have are just their assumptions.     The next reason why censorship in libraries is not a good idea is because it would cause job loss, economic trouble, and lose a safe place for kids.  Libraries are places that some kids hang out who are not playing sports.  These kids would not have books to read if there were taken off of shelves.  There would also be jobs lost if there was cenorship in libraries.  A library would contain less material for the workers to take care causing less people to help.  As a result of the jobs lost there would also be economic problems in the community.  The libraries make money off of the late fees they receive from material turned in late.  People in the community would have to go to a store to buy a certain book that might be offensive to someone else instead of reading it for free at a library.  There are some people that do not have the money to buy the book they would want.  Job loss and economic trouble are intertwined with each other.     Offensive material should not be taken off of the shelves because it would destroy history and people's imagination which leads to new inventions.  An example of history that would be destroyed would be books about the @CAPS1.  Books written over the @CAPS1 would be offensive because of the cruel treatment the @CAPS3 faced.  There are also pictures in these books that are sick to see.  History in books provide examples for people to follow so that they do not repeat history twice.  Books help people express their imagination in a unique form.  Imagination eventually leads to possibly new inventions that could help society.  The loss of imagination would lead people to stop striving to reach their goals.     Music, books, and magazines should not be censored from the libraries in communities.  These materials are only offensive to the people who do not like them.  Some materials like the @ORGANIZATION1 have been on shelves or read for hundred of years.  The sales from a @ORGANIZATION1 are much greater than that of any other book.  Books have been around for centuries and have not been censored from people, so why should they.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Some people like books, movies, music, and magazines with offenses in them. Personally, I do not. I believe that if there is bad material, or material that upsets or hurts someone in these items then they shouldn't be on a shelf at a library.     Offenses like racism and porn are both not good things that occur. They both cause many problems throughout the world. So why should we be putting it on shelves for anyone to see or hear about? We don't want people to think that it is a good thing when it's not.      Of course people do have a choice in what movie, or book they select, but what if it's someone who dosn't know what might be in the book or movie. They could be naive and not know what it is until they read or watch it and then they find out. That is not good for somone, especially if they are young. For example, I have gotton a couple of books from the library that look like a good books. Then I start reading it and it comes to a part where two people are making love. Then it goes into detail. I didn't know that the book was going to come to that. Then I wish I wouldn't have gotton that book.      Another main point is rap music. Some of it is not to bad. Alot of it though, tells alot of personal things that you are supposed to share with someone. I have observed that alot of rappers are @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So some people are racist because they believe that all @CAPS1 @CAPS4 are that way.       If they still put out offensive items on shelves of libraries and stores, then they should at least make a section for those kind of things. It isn't fair for someone to have to see these things when they don't want to. It would be alot better off if they just eliminated them all together",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are all different things that people use every single day.  Many of these @MONTH1 have things that parents might not want to have their chilcdren read or @MONTH1 just not like to read themselves. In my opinion these materials should not be removed from the shelves just becsuse they are found offensive to some.      There are many different books that have content that parents might not want their children to be learing about at a young age. If a parent does not want their child to read something that they believe is wrong they should not let them take the book off the shelf in the first place. Just because something is offensive to one person does not necessarly mean that is offensive to someone else.  Some books that were written during the time when slavery was really big that are available today usually contain some words that some people @MONTH1 not agree with in todays society. In my opinion if they do not like what is being said then they do not have to read that book. For example in my classes if we are reading a book that contains words that the teachers do not agree with as a class we skip over the word or words to make sure nobody is offended.  Just because there are a couple of offensive lines in a book does not necessarly mean that it is a bad book to read.      Music is one of the main materials that people tend to believe contains bad content. Many different songs do have words that people believe should not be aloud to be said in a song that anyone can listen to.  That is why some songs are changed for the radio because some radio stations will not play songs that contain explicit language in them.  For example in my case my parents blocked songs on @CAPS1 so that i cannot buy songs that contain explicit languange. This is a way for parents to have control over what their children listen to. There are many different ways that people can get music without explicit languange and if they cannot nobody is saying that they have to listen to that music.  There is lots of music that people do not find offensive and people could listen to that if they please instead.       Movies are another big thing that many people have a problem with and that is my many movies are rated. Movie companies rate their movies so that people know ahead of time what the movie contains. Once again some people might find some comments in movies to be offensive but there is not anyone that is forcing them to watch that movie. If a person does not agree with what a certain movie contains that does not mean that everyone else feels the same way.  Just because on person does not agree with what a movie contains does not mean that it should be taken off the shelves.     There are certain magazines that contain information of different things that some people might not want to see or have their children see at a young age. For this reason to buy  many different magazines you must be a certain age and magazines like this are usually harder to find. Many libraries would not contain many magazines like this in the first place but if they did, no one person should have the right to remove it from the shelf because they do not agree.     In my opinion books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to some people. Not every single person believes in the same things so it would be wrong taking the right from someone to read or listen to whatever they like",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Offinsive creations offf shelves?      '@CAPS1!!!!!!!!!They have taken my favorite magazine off the shelf. I think they just did that because the publisher was talking about people in bad way, but they still should not have taken it off the shelf.' @CAPS2 is what i would say if they took offensive thinkgs off the shelfs. In life most things, especially music and magazines, can be offensive but in the music, books, etc., it tells the truth some times and its just someone saying theur opinon on something. I think they should keep nonoffensive and offensive things on he shelf.      It is true, most music is not age appropriate for most kids these days. There are kids in @CAPS2 time that walk around singin about sex, drugs, or killing somebody. I am sure that parents donot want their kids speaking in violence like that. Yes, most parents would not let there kids listen to certain music, others would just let them listen to it and tell them that it is just a song and you should not go out doing something a song is talking about. With @CAPS2 offensive music i think it all comes down to how the parents raise their kids. If  yuor child is not like the music they listen to then the parents should just let them listen to the music they like. every body has their own style.     Also, I would think for a child to go to the library they should be with their parents and their parents would have to check the book out for them. If a pearent sees his/her child try to pic up an inapprpriate book they should explain to them that they are to young to be reading things like @CAPS2. When I was fourteen my mother had @CAPS2 book that i wanted to read. She said i was too young to read that book because it alks about sex. When i turned @NUM1 she finally let me read the book and now i finally understand why i could not read that book when i was younger. When she said it had sex in the book i thought she meant it would say something like how somebody was going to have sex and start talking about something else. When I read the book it gave details to how they was having sex and I realized my mother was right I was too young at the time.      Next, the magazines. I think offensive or not that the magazines should stay on the shelfs bcause they are very informative. They let you know everything that is happening with the famous people,what movie will be coming out soon, and you find good insiders. It seeems like the world would be a bit different with out offensive things in life. We need offensive to balance out all the good.      Finishing with my final thought, i would tlike to say we should keep the good and the bad on the shelfs. I think if we had just all nonoffensive things it would be more boring than it is with the offensive things. Like i said good and bad balances everything out just right. If the press, media, rappers or singer, writters even drawers, have something offensive to say it is okay because it is a good thing behind every bad thing.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,I strongly believe that the libraries should  have to take somethings down because things that are offensive to one person maybe funny  to other's. So yes they should take the offensive things of the shelves just to avoid alot of conflict & arguments fight's & things like that.    I remember I had an experience before with something similar  i was at a school in @LOCATION1 and some kids had wrote somethings on a wall and there were a whole lot of other kids looking and staring at what the kids had written on the wall just sitting and having a good time laughing at it while i just sat and stared because it was very offensive towards me i wanted to do something about it being on the wall but people just tried to make it seem as if it were just a little joke.You see you never know how something feels until its done to you just like i reamember when @CAPS1 magazine had @CAPS2 james on the cover that started up alot of contriversy because the way he was on the cover it was showing like he was some type of animal and people really didn't like that.                                     I read in a book once that black people should go back to where they came from it was saying alot of really nasty things about black people and it was in a librarie now im not making this a racial thing im just saying what i read and it was just sitting there as if this is ok for people to say and it can be in a public place like this i didnt like it one bit but thats just me now some people @MONTH1 find that book amusing or just down right funny but to me it was a very offensive thing,3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Cencorship in libraries isn't a big issue for me. If there is a book I find offensive or music, or a movie, or anything else for that matter, I won't check it out. Things I find offensive and tings others find offensive could be completely different.           Libraries are organized in sections, like there is an adult reading section, a childrens reading section, and maybe even a teen reading section. Why would anyone let their young child go looking for a book in the adult section? I know I wouldn't. If libraries can take the time and separate the books so that different age groups have thier own section, can't people take the time to appriciate it?     Libraries have a wide variety of books, movies, music, and magazines to choose from. If you find a book or someting of that matter to be offensive, I say you should just put it back and move on to something different. You shouldn't go complaining to people about it, that probably won't solve your problem. Something one person finds offensive could be another person's favorite movie. So would it be fair to take it off the shelf because one person finds it offensive, no it wouldn't be fair at all.     Knowing what they're interested in, why would somebody go looking in a section they might find something offensive in. I know I'm interested in books about the paranormal, so i wouldn't go looking at the book about flowers. I don't think flowers offend anyone, but like everything else there could be someone. If everyone who found something offensive, got their way and it was taken off the shelf, there wouldn't be anymore books for any one to read.     Libraries have a good grasp on cencorship, I think now it's the our turn to look past some of the things we find offensive, because there could be someone out ther who has read it a million times",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I don't think censorship in libraries is the best idea because some people like reading books and magazines that tend to have offensive writing in it. Some people find them interesting and like reading and listening to those kinds of things. A lot of music today have offensive words in them but people still like listening to that kind of music.      Taking the books and music that are found offensive off the shelves also restricts the authors freedom of speech. The author has the freedom to write about what he or she thinks or wants to write about. The author also @MONTH1 write about life experiences and events that @MONTH1 be offensive but interesting to the readers.      Everyone likes different kind of music and books. Taking a lot of materials off the shelves @MONTH1 cause people to not come anymore or not be interested in reading anymore. Some people enjoy reading or listening to things that probably shouldn't be heard but they find it interesting and enjoy it.      A lot of stuff has already been cencsored today. Most songs that you would find in the library that have explicit content are already censored and taking it completely off the shelf would be wrong in my opinion. If people are listening or reading explicit content, they know what they are doing and are  doing it for a reason. No one goes to a library to listen to music that they don't find interesting or like. Taking that off the shelf would cause people to not go to the library anymore.      I believe that these materials should be kept on the shelves for people to be able to enjoy what they like. People have the right to listen or read what they please",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,Yes I do. Because you don't want your kids growing up to do the same you did or listening to same thing you did because might want kill somebody like the song be saying.I wouldn't tell don't listen to them because that would make me a hippacrit. I would just tell my kid just don't nothing bad or don't go to jail for nothing stupid. I would my child a better person then I was so he can become a good man for his wife and kids and tell son/ daughter to do the same. Magazines if it is a nude magazine tell him/her to give me that and I don't want you to ever look at anything like this again.

2,"Since mankind has been able to form an opinion, someone else has taken offense to it.  It is nearly impossible to have an opinion that everyone agrees with.  No matter how lovely it would be if everyone was happy with what another person thought or expressed, it is not practical in the slightest.  However, one of man's basic rights is the right to express himself, and censorship takes this away.  Certain materials, such as books, movies, music, or magazines, should not be removed from the shelves if found offensive.     Parents @MONTH1 be concerned for their children's sake when it comes to the censorship issue.  With the internet and media of today, it can prove challenging to protect minors from sensitive material.  While complete censorship is rather ridiculous, it is as prudent to limit access to books, magazines, and websites just as it is to deny children under the age of eighteen access to an inappropriate movie without parental consent.  Limiting access, though, doesn't mean to eradicate a piece of art.  Adults should have the choice to be able to see what they want to, and parents should be allowed the choice to determine what their child is exposed to without the government limiting their options.     People of different religions can find many things made by people outside of their religion to be unsavory.  If some forms are found to be unsuitable by a major religion, then they can have the power to remove the offending work from the public eye.  However, doing so is a direct violation of the separation of church and state.  If the government is allowed to choose what we can and cannot see, and the government is dominated by those of a certain religion, then the freedom of religion and many more freedoms will be overlooked.     If the government does not have some control over a country, then it is likely that chaos and anarchy would ensue.  However, too much control would lead to a dictatorship.  Either option is undesirable, but if our country is allowed to have control over what we see and hear, then we are quickly headed towards the latter of the two.  @CAPS1 is a country that was founded on the belief that mankind has basic rights that must never be violated, and if those rights are destroyed in an effort to be 'politically correct,' then our country stands for nothing.     Censorship of certain materials that are found to be offensive is a direct violation of our rights, and should be stopped.  Everyone has something they find offensive, but if they take the choice to have it removed, then, as Katherine Paterson said, our shelves will be empty.  Our culture will be eliminated.  Everything that makes @CAPS1 great will be gone.  Mankind has opinions that others will find offensive, but at least he will have the freedom to give them to the world.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I think katherine is wrong and in some ways and right in other ways.I dont think they should take the books and etc., off the shelves if they are offensive. I also think that people have there own say if it is bad or offensive. I think that you have a right to pick up the book or movies and if it offensive to you than dont get it. Also people have there own likes and differences, so some people @MONTH1 think it is offensive and some @MONTH1 not.    I as a person think if it is offensive to me than i wont look at the book, or listen to the music and etc. I dont think you should punish everyone just because everyone had diffrent likes. I agree if you dont like it than dont look at it just like i said. There are people out there that likes the crazy offensive stuff but you gotta stop and think it might not be offensive to them. I have rented a movie and i read the back i relized that it was nothing like the reading, i did stop watching it cause it was really offensive and cruel.       I think the libraries need to watch what they put out there. There are little kids that dont need to see offensive things.I also  believe that little kids need to stick in the kids sections. I have been in a library that has diffrent section to show where the different types of books are. There are many different types of books and you got to watch what you read and see.       In katherine paragraph i think she is right when she talks about removing the books off the shelf, i believe this is not right. I agree with her because some people might like these books and if you take one off than ther will be no books left on the shelf for any body that likes them types of books.     I think you should leave all types of books, movies,etc., everyone has there different thoughts on what type of books they like. I think you should not punish everyone because you never know what types of books, movies people will get. I do believe that if a movie or book is offensive than dont pick it up just leave it on the book shelf. There are many types of books and movies and etc. out ther for everyone.

2,"I do not think it is right to have books, music, movies, magazines, etc. without censorship on them in libraries.      Many parents bring their kids into libraries to show them that reading is fun, and the library is a nice place to sit and read a book. By having obscene books, music, movies, magazines, etc., it has a big affect on kids, and how they are going to grow up.     Whenever I go to the library with my family, I do not want to read, hear, or look at anything that would be offensive to me, or other people. I have a little brother who loves to read, and I don't want to have him go into a library and accidently pick up something that has obscene stuff in the reading.     Certain books such as a book that makes fun of someone for being black, white, fat, skinny, etc., is part of the reason that there should be censorship in libraries. By having people read how its bad if you are fat, or you wont fit in if you are a different color, causes people to want to change how they look. Just by the influence of a book would make someone want to do that, and its wrong. If a kid sees a type of book like that, it could possibly lead them to being self concience of how they look.     Once while going into a librarie, I went to go look in the teen section, and there was a book about a girl who was not skinny, and she starved herself so she could be skinny. The book was all about how it is fine to starve yourself to look a certain way. I was stunned by that. That book could be the cause of a girl or boy that will go home and starve theirselve for days just to loose weight. It's not right to have that type of books, because the little things in life make the biggest impact.     What does not having censorship in our libraries say about our country? That it is good to have that type of stuff? It's a horrible thing to have other people think that about us. By making the world a better place the solution just might be adding censorship. It would not only make libraries a better place to go to, but also make our country be a better place.     Although other people have a different opinion on adding censorship in libraries, my opinion is to have censorship in libraries. All over the world there is already offensive stuff everywhere, so why not make the library a safe enviornment for everyone to go to to read and learn more. It will help children to grow up in a safe environment, and also for making the world a better place",3.0,3.0,4.0

Anytime that I have visited a library, I always look for the book, magazine, etc. that interest me the most. I'm not a kid that gets easily offended by much of anything, but if i do see something that could be at all possibly offensive to myself, I probably won't read it. Like the author @PERSON1 said, ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--- that work i abhor--- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' That quote is saying that @ORGANIZATION1 has the same right and power to take that said offensive book from the shelf, but it is your choice if you want to pick it up or leave it alone for the next reader. I have never once felt offended by the books in the library, since I only read the ones I want to read. If i was ever to pick up a random book and find it offensive why would I keep reading it. Again, @ORGANIZATION1 has the same right to pick that book up, but they also have the same right to put that book back down.

2,"Fowl language, innapropriate scenes, and unexpected words can really effect anyone in the world today.  You are expected to just know whether what you are reading, watching, or even listening to is good for you.  There are warnings on movies and songs, but is that truly enough to keep young viewers and listeners from staying away from it?  Censorship is around for a reason, and I believe that it shouldn't be abused by anyone.      Although I am a teenager, and like most teenagers I don't follow all the rules, oddly enough censorship is something I am completely for.  Being the eldest of three I think about what I know is out there for young ears and eyes, and it doesnt amuse me.  I want to desperately watch out for my younger brother and sister, letting them be surrounded by explicitness is not an option.  I see everyday what the world is turning into, and what is becoming of our country.  I've been effected by the books that I have read, movies I have watched, or songs I have heard due to the fact that they portray the wrong message.       Drinking alcohol, smoking, using inappropriate language, and sex is what fills the news stands, billboards, shelves, and music devices.  The more open these ideas are, the more they will be easy for young children and underage teenagers to become accustom to.  Censorship is around to protect you and nothing else.  Giving out bad influences only harms the society instead of helping it, I doubt that is what most people strive for.  Im observing kids at younger ages get involved into things they shouldn't be involved in, because of what they are used to seeing or what they can easily get ahold of.  This is only because censorship is not as effective as it needs to be.  Censorship is especially important in libraries, its an easy process to retrieve something not suitable for you.      Libraries have thousands of books ready to be taken home and read.  With a library card, those books are free and you can get one anytime you'd like.  It is an incredibly simple process.  Censorship needs to be taken very seriously when its a matter of a book in someones hands, the wrong persons hands in this case.  If there is a book, movie, magazine, or type of music found offensive, I believe one hundred percent that is should be taken off the shelf.  You never know who the next person to read that book will be, and whether or not it will make an impact on their life in a bad way.  It is much better to be safe than sorry.     Censorship is around in the society today, but it is definitely not as effective as it needs to be.  The world is changing, and we want it to change in a way that will help us, not hurt us.  Keeping the bad out will only bring the good in.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do you beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed form the shelves if they are found offensive? Well I don't even if some books are not sutible for sertain ages. The parents should be abel to control what their kids read. If they let a kid go into the library by themselves they will probably most likelypick out a book that is bad for them and the parents blaim the library for having them when they should be blaiming themselves for letting their child go into the library by themselves.     Most parents don't like books being in the library that are about drugs, violence, and stuff like that. Well parents can control what their kids read if they go into the library with them an help them pick out books that are in their level. I mean most parents don't care what their kids read an then they try to blaim everything bad they do on the library for having them books in their for them to read. Those types of books in their are for teens and adults because they are interesting to read. I would rather read one of those books rather than a little kids book.      Most public libraries also have it where you can rent movies. Libraries are gona have movies that are rated '@CAPS1' and '@NUM1' because if they didn't they wouldnt have much success in rental of movies. All they would have is little kid movies an what teenager or adult between @NUM2 and @NUM3 would want to watch a little kid movie. I don't think any of them would want to watch any of that. They need action movies and other movies like that with alot of violence and stuff in it.        Reading is what shapes this world. Eveybody reads books everyonce in awhile. Most adults read books on weekened nights when they don't have anything planned. Teenagers have to read surtain books in school that are assigned by teachers in english class.      Parents need to learn that they cannot control what is in types of movies and books are in the library, only the state and the library can control that. They have these books in their for a reason. Every book has a reason to stay in the library to",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"A library should not have to censor their books. If parents decide that they do not want their child accidentally picking up a book with offensive material, then they are responsible for either going with the child to pick one out themselves or buying their own books for their children to read. It should not have to be the library's responsibility to make sure children are reading suitable material. After all, the parent is the one allowing the child to go to the library without supervision.     Next, there are many other places in addition to the library for children to hear or see offensive material. For example, most children probably watch television at home with their parents, but what parent wants to watch cartoons and 'iCarly' all night? The answer is not many. Another thing to think about is cell phones. It seems as if every eight-year-old now has a cell phone, and if that cell phone has internet access, the possibilities of what a child could find there are endless. Video games are yet another place where children might be exposed to violence or otherwise offensive content. The media is to blame, not libraries.     Also, every child goes to school, and some of the learning done at school is not taught by a teacher. Other children have a huge effect on what a child will see, hear, and learn. It is impossible to prevent. For example, when I was a little girl, I was allowed to go to a friend's house, and I remember watching a movie that my parents would not approve of, and my parents never knew.     In addition, preventative  measures have been taken at libraries to keep chidren from finding these forbidden readings. Special rooms are made for different age groups in order to keep teenagers from influencing the younger children. Also, it might help if a librarian was available to make sure younger children do not read or check out unsuitable movies, @CAPS1's, magazines, or books.     Finally, if libraries are going to be censored, then everything else would have to be. It is not fair to punish community libraries for the good of a few kids. Children are going to discover things on their own, and parents have to learn to let them.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I think it depends on what they are censoring. Words that can be considered racist and offensive or are just inappropriate for kids shouldnt be displayed. Movies with gore should only be able tot be taken out as long as the parent is with them. I come from @LOCATION2, and there nudity is perfectly ok and I think it should be ok here too. Its just the human body, people shouldn't be afraid of it or have to censor it. So I believe nudity shouldn't be censored.     In my opinion, some things should be censored and others shouldn't. Curse words should still be censored for kids because I believe its not right to teach kids at a young age foul language. Racist words should be too so there isn't any racist drama or so the company doesn't get sued. Movies with gore and horror should be only available to kids as long as the parent is ok with them watching it. Books shouldn't be censored unless they are made for adults only. Books are all about imagination, so a book could only be as graphic as the kid pictures in their head. If the kid doesn't like whats in the book then he can stop reading it. Casual nudity shouldn't be censored. I grew up around nudity in @LOCATION2 and it doesn't bother me one bit. In every country, besides The @LOCATION1, is ok with nudity since it just the human body. Why they freak out over it so much, I have no idea but 'exccesive' nudity I don't think should be displayed to youger kids. I think they should reach an age limit, like @NUM1, before seeing anything like that. Music should be like my opinion for horror movies. If parents dont want them listening to some rapper talk about how he's shooting people and doing drugs or a band that worships the devil. I'm perfectly fine with that. I'd hate for my kids to listen to anything like that. They should keep the rating on everything still just in case some parents aren't ok with it.     In conclusion, everyone has their own opinion. I'm sure many people would disagree with mine but that's how I see it. Some of the things they have censored here, in my opinion, shouldn't. While others should remain censored for the youth or faint hearted. Libraries are public places and it depends on what they public is and is not ok with. Libraries normally don't have much that should be kept from the youth or have anything that's really offensive so most of this most people shouldn't even worry about.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"What kind of books are the children of our world reading now and days? Are the books they get ahold of age appropriate or the movie that they go and watch really what they think it is? Parents, teachers, and just regular citezens all over the world are asking themselves these questions almost everyday whenever they see their child reading a book with the front cover of a girl and a guy kissing or whenever their child is watching a movie thats pretty graphic. The next thing that needs to be asked is why, why are children at certain ages aloud to pick out this book or movie from a library and be able to take it home with them and watch and almost scar their lives forever from watching one simple movie or reading a book. Books and movies need to be reviewed so parents, teachers, and citezens don't half to ask why?      When you go to a library you expect to find different sections for different age groups of kids. Well sometimes if the kids are sent to the library alone they don't follow the guidelines of where they are suppose to be getting their books from. That's exactly when children of such young ages pick up book, movies, magazines, etc. that they shouldn't be picking out. Their needs to have be certain age requirements on different books because to many kids now and days are learning and hearing about different things that they shouldn't be hearing about. Either a parent needs to go with the child when they go to the library or the person who checks the book outta the library needs to check the book. If people can't even check what kind of book they are giving to a little child then they need to be taken out of the library. Those kinds of books and movies that are being given to little kids need to be banded from the library or put in a special place where young children can't get ahold of them. Books, movies, magazines, etc. need to be reviewed before putting them on the shelf, especially if it is going to be in the reach of a little kid. Even though the cover might look age appropriate doesn't mean the words on the inside are.     I can remember myself one evening, my little cousin was over at my house and we were just talking. I had made the mistake myself about having a show on tv that wasn't appropriate for her age. My little cousin started to talk to me about things that I myself that was bad to just randomly blurt out and talk about. My little @NUM1 year old cousin was talking to me about sex. I had to ask her where she was hearing or even learning this kind of information from. She flat out told me that she had read a book from the library at school that was talking about all that kind of stuff. I was appalled to hear that even at a school library there were books that consisted of talking about things that adults should be talking about. Books like that should be taken out of school libraries for good and be put in a more responsible place. I understand, yes that having books like that in a public library in a top shelved area where a little kid couldn't reach it or maybe a high school library is ok because kids at that age understand what that kind of stuff is, but when it becomes a time when a elementary school kid talks to you about that either from reading a book or watching a movie from a library that's when it needs to be taken care of!     So yes, I agree @PERCENT1 that if the person putting the book on the shelf isn't going to take the time of day to overlook the book or watch the simplest movie before they put it out for the public to be exposed to, then the book shouldn't go on the shelf at all! You never know what will be on the inside of those books. Kids don't deserve to half to sit there and read or watch a movie over things that they don't need to know about. Even myself as a teenager find things like that offensive to see in a magazine or movie, never the less a @NUM1 year old in elementary school that still has a life to live. I might be @NUM3 years older that my @NUM1 year old cousin, but i still believe that items that include offensive behaviors or fowl language should not be available! I feel that everyday I can walk down the hallways and just hear people talking about what they watched or read and most of the time it includes offensive things.     So in conclusion, I believe that items that are marked as offensive to anybody should be taken off the shelves and put into storage away from the world. Even if that one book or movie is to be told a number one hit, it needs to be taken off the shelves to save little kids and even teens from having to deal or hear about those items. Take it off the shelf or don't put it up at all!",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Many forms of literature is found to be offensive, especially adults' sections that are provided only for their entertainment. But sometimes children sway from their shelves, that are censored for their well-being, and to an inappropriate section. I believe that these certain books should not be provided in a public library where children go with their parents.     I know how curious children are, especially at my sister's age. She is only nine-years-old, but she is slowly making her way to being a young adolecent and has strayed into adult territory in the library many times. Most of these books have inappropriate language, scenes of 'love-making', and violence. Of course people say that children at her age are supposed to learn these aspects of life on their own, but why should she accidentally read a book that has these certain aspects and then consider it okay? The libraries should be censored. If an adult wants a certain book like that then they should buy it for themselves and hide it away from pure minds. However, if an individual cannot afford to buy their books for themselves then either a library for adults should be made, or special sections in libraries could be fenced off that only adults can enter.     Even magazines, I think, should be censored. Most magazines are not based on a child's mind. They are made for gossip and are more suitable for an adult's mind-set. Especially the ones about celebrity relationships, drama, drugs, and alcohol. We should be trying to teach our children not subject them to ideas of corruption that society thrusts upon them.     Society can be cruel to whoever is thrown out into it. That is why we prepare our children: to be ready to go out on their own. However, from these books they learn too early. Even if it's accidental or not the books and/or magazines can corrupt an innocent mind and influence our generation. We need to censor our libraries for this reason and make sure the children's minds match their age and keep them from being influenced by society.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe that certain books should be where the libraries can actually have control of the books magazines music and movies to teenage adults @NUM1 and up. I disagree by them trying to remove the items from the libraiers. I'll just make sure that whom, ever trying to purchase the item should have picture id stating that the adult is @NUM1.                    Students should be able to go look for there items that they are searching for freely. They need to be good readers and like exploring other activies like movies and magazines. Adults should'nt be punish for the mistake that other people are making by creating these offesive things. I agree that children should'nt be able to read it. There still growing up and should be exploring diffrent things instead of negativity.               As a parent students should not be able to do certain things. Like goes in the library and purchase offensive books and other materials with out a parent or gaurdiant with them. Parents should be more strict on there kids by what they do or watch other children do cause if they groqw up watching everyone do wrong by them. Thats what they go think they can do. Students should take there education serious.               Me being a young mother my mother made sure that i had everything i wanted. She made sure i did the right thing because you have to learn your lessons. And student should grow up knowing what's right and wrong. If you think a book is not right for your child or a movie take it away and then tell your child why you think this is not right for him or her. I just believe thats the right thing to do. Then when your child grows up to be an adult then they will know what to tell there children right from wrong.                         Just be aware that there are some places that will let your child purchase things that he or she is not suppose to. I just will check over your child daily and see what they are reading for they want grow up thinking they can read things that aint bout the right for them.

2,"Censorship in the @LOCATION1 libraries is a largely discussed topic amongst its citizens. Some of these citizens are against censorship and stand strongly next to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3. Then there are others that believe in 'protecting the young minds of @LOCATION2 from flthy literature.' @CAPS4 analyzing @CAPS5 arguement, the obvious and correct answer would be to agree with the citizens that are against censorship.     Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And the we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS5 quote from Paterson alludes to the fact that if literature begins to be censored, then literature and works of art will cease to exist. Paterson could not be any more correct in her inference. The strong stance that many citizens of the @LOCATION3 take next to the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must remain @CAPS5 way or literature will vanish. As all of the @LOCATION3 citizens know, even the ones that agree with censorship, that literature is to valuable to children and to everybody for it to just be thrown away. The works of art from around the world should be used to open people's minds, and not be used for kindling in a fire. Therefore the citizens that protect the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 must remain in doing so or the life of the valuable literature will be dead forever in the @LOCATION3     @CAPS10 these citizens that are against censorship and protect the works of art, these citizens must allow some censorship in @LOCATION3 libraries. @CAPS5 is because libraries must be able to understand where to draw the line for some literature. '@CAPS11' magazine can be used as an example. @CAPS5 magazine, as all should know, should not be allowed in children's schools. Like @CAPS5 magazine and many other literature texts and pornagraphic movies, libraries should be selective on what to allow and what not to allow on the shelves. Even though there is a large argument on @CAPS5 topic between two groups, the groups would mostly likely agree to censoring @CAPS5 type of literature from the school.      The citizens that protect the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3 are correct to stand up for what is right to do in @CAPS5 situation. People, mainly children, should be allowed to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to in libraries, with some exceptions. These exceptions that have to do with how 'adult' movies and books that should not be allowed in libraries. @CAPS10 with @CAPS5 exception, the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION3 @CAPS3 should not be spit on by the @CAPS17 people and should not allow censorship in @LOCATION3 libraries. Without the protection of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, people would be robbed of observing works of art from around the world.

2,"No, I do not believe that some books, music, and magizines should be removed because one person thought it was offensive. Like Katherine Paterson said, if everyone had the right to remove a book that they didn't like or thought was offensive, we would end up with having no or very little books in a library.      Anyone can say they find a book, a type of music, or a certain magizine offensive. The problem is, is what do they find offensive about it? Is it to vulgar? Inappropriate for small children to find? Or do they believe it contains racial slurs, or anything putting down a certain race? Either way, if someone thought a certain item should be removed they probably should have a really good reason for it to be taken or removed from the library.      Taking away certain items or books is a really hard thing to do probably if you really think about it. Some people @MONTH1 be offended if another person that didn't like the subject of it just  took away that book talked about a certain country, heritage, or anything that might of tied the people to history in time. Maybe even children stories that have been passed down and told through out time might offend people if they were taken from the library. How would parents tell their children wonderful fairy tales or exciting adventures that characters experienced if they where taken out? The stories would be lost though time and no one would never know what was the right story or not.      Also, with the music, some people @MONTH1 not like what others listen to, but that doesn't mean that they have to remove that certain type of music from a place. If a certain person doesn't like rap, then don't go to the rap section and start going through every artist and song trying to figure out which one you dont like the most. That's just ridiculous and uncalled for. Let's say a person likes country music but not metal. Would the person that likes country music like it if another person who hates country but loves metal comes to the library and remove every single country song, album, and artist from the library? No, I think not.      All together it would probably start tons of fueds on what people have and/or are removing from libraries.  Everyone would fight for what they like and try to keep it placed there in the library.

2,"The censorship of materials in public places should not be happening. The idea of it @MONTH1 seem decent, however it can easily be taken too far. The @CAPS1 gives @CAPS2 the ability to have access to whatever they want. This means that in publicly owned places such as libraries, the people should be able to see all things that are in the library. Though to some people, some documents @MONTH1 seem to be unreasonable, and too bad for other people to see, it is not their choice. America is known across the world for the freedom of speech, freedom of press, and should also be freedom to see.      The censorship of reading options in schools has been taken too far. It is clear that certain books are meant for adults, however this has been pushed to the limit. In schools, books like @ORGANIZATION1 have been removed due to people thinking that it encourages magic. Taking the books away, is taking their rights away. Is is so bad that there is now a @CAPS3 Book @CAPS4, which encourages schools that have not @CAPS3 certain books to promote the ones that have been in other schools. The fact that censorship has been taken so far that some schools are not allowed to read books other children are, is outrageous. What children read should be up to their parents, not to their principals.      Libraries are not the only place where controversial things  are found. If people really want to see something, they could go and find it elsewhere, like the internet. The internet has all of the same things that could be found in public areas and worse. The internet has the ability for a person to search and find just about anything and everything a person could think of. The internet has not been censored, so why should our public places? If it can be encountered it on the internet, it is reasonable that they should have it in public areas as well.      Though the materials should not be removed, it is resonable for them to be put into sections according to their audience. Having the books organized with similar ones is completely reasonable, and a way to censor the books, without removing them. To incorporate a 'science fiction' area and an 'adult' area, are great ways to warn the people of what could easily be included in the section. People would quickly learn to go only in the areas they want, and avoid all areas they do not want to see. Another options is something similar to what is done for movies. Rating things by their content, and using a warning sign would also work for books. It would explain to the reader exactly what they were going to get. This puts the decision upon the individual if what they are reading is okay for them, not to the people surrounding them.     @CAPS2 have twisted their ideas of their rights in the constisution so much that they attempt to dictate what other @CAPS2 can and cannot do. This attempt is completely the opposite of what the @CAPS1 is telling them. People have the rights to censor themselves, but not others. If they do not want to see a reading material, it follows they should choose to stay away from it, not take it from other people. It is lawful for the things to be arranged in such a manner that it is an option to avoid, however it is still accessable to others. Taking books away from people who want to read them is not only un-american, it is unconstitutional, and wrong.",4.0,4.0,7.0

I think music is a way of expressing yourself and I think that should stay. I think that movies should be taken off, because some could be offensive to people that watch them.     Censorship is a big part of life. people don't like some of it but they have to deal with it. I understand that some people find stuff offensive.The way I look at it is dont read it or watch it. I know that sounds kind of mean but it's something we all have to live through. I think that bad books and movies should be taken off the shelves because of kids and some adults that arn't mature. I also think that books and movies about rape shouldn't be aloud to be anywhere because that is just wrong and not right for someone to have that. I think that is a big part that people might find offensive because of something maybe that happened in their lives or a family or friends life.     I'm not saying libraries are bad because they help me with research and with school work but I just wish they would choose their books and movies wisely.

2,"Censorship in public libraries should not be allowed.  Every person has something that he finds offensive that others @MONTH1 not.  Giving people the freedom to take opportunities away from other people should not be an option.  Letting censorship be allowed in public libraries is similar to taking the rights away from citizens at public libraries, therefore, taking away the principles on why the public library was founded in the first place.      The public library acts as an opportunity for all classes of people to get information via movie, book, computer, or any other storer of information.  If certain books, movies, computers, etc... are not stored at the library due to censorship, how is the 'average @PERSON1' supposed to pick up that information?  The only other option in this case would be to buy it, however, if we let censorship allowed in all public libraries what will be next?  Will it go to far?  Will online databases, bookstores, movie theaters, and internet shopping sites be censored as well?       There are many award winning war movies out in the world today that tell the story of that particular war better than any person @MONTH1 be able to do.  Not only is 'a picture worth a thousand words,' but also if we let libraries become censored (the storer of the majority of information in the world) and becomes a domino effect with other informational sources, how are teachers going to be able to teach what has happened in our history?  The terrorist attack on @NUM1 was a horrifying event to watch on @CAPS1.  There were people jumping out of windows while there offices and structure which they were just standing on was being burned to the ground.  This obviously wouldn't pass the 'censorship' that some want offered in libraries.  How can @CAPS2's warn the next generations about the dangers of @CAPS3 extremists if there is no libraries to back up this information?  Will it be lost overtime?       The censorship in libraries in an obserd idea, and should not even have the option to be considered.  There are too many great works in the world to just throw away due to censorship, as well as a great deal of dangers in the world that need to be passed on, and without these works and movies being stored in libraries there is no easy way to get ahold of them.  The domino effect happens quite often throughout history, for example the rise and fall of communism, and letting the libraries be censored will result in all the other storers of information being censored, and that is just not parallel to the rights of the @CAPS2 citizen",4.0,4.0,7.0

I myself havew never seen something offensive to me but I think it @MONTH1 have been offensive to others.        By taking these books off the shelves it would change a whole lot. There would be no more complaints. Which is a good thing because you dont want you store to have a bad reputation for inappropriate or offensive things on your shelves. You dont want little kids coming in there and seeing all that stuff anyway. So, it would just be best to take it down or off the shelves.      So, when somebody complains ir asks you to take it down you should proabaly do it. If your gonna have that stuff then have a different sectio for it that only people of age can go into. Like I said i have not once been offended by it but i think some people @MONTH1 have been just not myself and no matter what it has to do with someone somewhere can always be offended by it because of religion or parents or other reasons",3.0,2.0,3.0
2,"I just got done reading The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2. Where a young boy escapes with a slave to get to freedom down the @LOCATION1. Now this book has been banned a lot in the years mainly because of it's use of the 'n-word' to refer to the slaves. Most people would think that it is racist to call a slave that, but I think it captures the time of the novel as being in the @DATE1's right before the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, when during the time there was debates about slavery. If they wont read this book because of the fact it uses the n-word, then a censored version should be made changing the n-word to slave because its a great book that everyone should read. Still most @CAPS4 ban the book just because of that one word.         Many @CAPS4 have banned books for being offensive to some people but I dont think they should be taken off the shelves. If you come across a book that your reading and you find it offensive. Take it to the libarian and you should state the reason the book is offenisve and the libariry should decide whether or not to remove it from the shelves. Instead of removing it the book should get a little label describing why it is bad so then when your looking for a book you can know whether or not the book has any offensive words or themes. The books could also get a censored version made, so that if you want to read the book there are two copies there to choose from the censored and the uncensored versions.   Most people dont know what they are missing when they see a book on a banned list and do not read it. Some of the greatest stories are on the banned list. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 should all have a part of the store that shows banned books so people that want to read them can and people that dont want to read them know where they are at so they can steer clear of that area. Is it not a constitutional right to have the freedom of speech? Does that mean taking books off the shelves is breaking that constitutional right?",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1,     I wish to address the fact of the censorship of materials of your library. I feel some of the censorship is very well needed and then I feel that other times the censorship is not needed. There are many factors that I consider when I identify a piece of material as appropriate or inapppropriate.      My first example is when I see material that @MONTH1 contain violence or hatrid towards a race or a certian group of individuals. When I see this, I consider this book appropriate when this material would just explain why there was this hostility toward a certian group.      I would also consider this book appropriate if, for example, a book was written about  the life of an @CAPS2 @CAPS3 during slavery. If the book is written to explain the life of someone who was a slave and it explained how it truly was during that time and how there were hardships, this book would  be appropriate to me. If the book contains something such as racist terms, I would consider this ok only because this was what it was like during this time. As long as it was implying how the people were mean and evil to these people.     Another example could be a movie that shows many killings  of an race, culture, or religion that is a true story. If the suituation happened in real life, I would find it ok because it explains a true event. In my mind, the event must also support why this killing was wrong and how it was out of line.        Inappropriate material can be easy or very hard to spot. For example, If the library contains a magazine that promotes something harmful to someone are implies hostility towards some group or individual in any way, I think it should be banned. An example could be a @CAPS4 flag on a magazine that had no relation to history whatsoever. This would be appropriate if they were talking about the @CAPS5 @CAPS6, but in this case it is a sign of hostility toward a group of individuals. Someone who is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @MONTH1 find this offensive and question if the library supported a certian race of people.      More innappropriate  material in my mind would be something that favors a certian political @ORGANIZATION2 and that tries to diminsh another @ORGANIZATION2 or a celibrity magazine. This material should not be in a library because no group or individuals should be put down for their beliefs. An example would be someone who would read a book @CAPS9 the @ORGANIZATION1. Let's say this book contains material that talking down on the @ORGANIZATION2. If a @CAPS10 saw this he or she @MONTH1 question if  the library holds hostility towards @CAPS11.      Relating to my movie example in the fourth paragraph, I have a reason to bring up a case for more inappropriate material. Some movies are not appropriate for a library or for a library or anywhere else in my opinion. An example of this could be a movie that wasn't true that showed a man who had to work with a group of @CAPS12 somewhere. Say the @CAPS12 tried to assure that their belief was right and his wasn't. Then the man would decide assemble a group of people to kill a group of people that were @CAPS14. This movie would not be approriate at all because of the message it sends. This movie would send a message to some to show hostility towards a race or a religion, and in a way, encourage them to eliminate these people.      This is the way I feel on the suituation and I would hope that my concerns about this will not go unnoticed. I hope this letter is taken into consideration.                                                            Sincerely,                                                       @ORGANIZATION3",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"All throughout the world there are millions of libraries that contain all kinds of material. In this world there are also many people who have different interests. These people all unite in what we call the library. The library is a place for anyone of any age that provide them with a wide range of material to suit their interests.      Some @MONTH1 say that not all the materials are appropriate for others. Remember the library is a place for everyone, so with viewing comes resposibilty and judgement. What one @MONTH1 find offensive , another @MONTH1 find delightful. This is a diverse world full of many different people, theres no saying what would be considered offensive or not.      Removing certain materials from the shelfs has very little signifigance, simply, if you don't like it-don't look at it. For parents or anyone who is concerned about children or young ones coming across material that @MONTH1 be harmful to them, simply view or suggest positive books or material that would interest them, or just stay by their side and guide them to appropriate material and away from the bad.     Truly if one comes across something they find offensive, thats their own fault. You control what you view and do, so blaming the library is not a reasonable option.

It's not like people have to read it, even if they don'@CAPS1 want to. If you know it's boring or bad in any way just leave it alone and let someone else read it if they want to.      However, there should be warnings oin some books just like there is no @CAPS1.V. shows. If it contains adult content just make it obvious so it doesn'@CAPS1 fall into the hands of some little kid. Books aren'@CAPS1 the only thing that have been banned for inappropriate content either. Many songs are banned from being played on the radio because they have underlying themes and ideas that many people say is offensive. A famous rapper, @ORGANIZATION1 is a good example of how music is censored for all the wrong reasons. He @MONTH1 cuss but in almost all of his songs he has a message about his life.      You shouldn'@CAPS1 ban or even censor things just for swearing. All you have to do is monitor who is listening to it or reading it. It's not hard to put a warning on some books that say it might be inappropriate for children or it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.      And really, who cares if kids cuss anyways?

2,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     'To each your own.' @CAPS1 is a quote I try to live by. We all have our own opinions, personalities, likes, and dislikes; most of the time, I believe, it is in one's best interest to agree to disagree with an oposing idea.      There are an abundence of books that I can think of that can be taken as controversial pieces. One in particular is The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. In @CAPS1 book a country girl is arranged to marry a man who beats her, in reality she is lesbian. In parts of the books she is called offensive names, but in the end she is able to overcome indifference and be happy with someone she loves. To someone who is against same sex marriage, exspecially when @CAPS1 book came out, @CAPS1 happy ending @MONTH1 be an outrage. They @MONTH1 think that the book should indeed be taken off the shelf. I do not think it would be fair to abanish a book like @CAPS1 because certain people dissagree with the story plot. I also believe that a book like @CAPS1 can be benifical to those who need support dealing with simular situations.      Just @DATE1, a group of people were trying to get rid of the word nigger in one of our books we were reading in class about slavery. I can see how @CAPS1 could easily offend someone of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 race, but I also think that the book was just trying to help the narrator sound realistic. Using @CAPS1 word also provided historical background and helped us understand how harsh many @CAPS4 @CAPS7 had it in that time period.      Books are a good way to excape from our own lives into a new time period or a new setting. Books can teach you about different races, ethnic groups, political ideas, or social structures. As Katherine Paterson stated, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Everyone should get the freedom to read any book they please. You are free to chose to dislike a book and never read it again; in my opinion,  that is as good as abanishing a book",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"In libraries across the world their are problems with censorship. Their are even problems with censorship in our very own @ORGANIZATION1 at school, but do we see these problems? People think censorship is just another word people use on a daily basis, but it really means so much more. Is it an issue or is it something we can just look over? Should we fix this problem or should we let it on by?     Censorship is definitly not something we can just look over. It is something we have to think and act upon. If  we just let people control what is in libraries will we ever get a taste of the real world? Will we ever know the issues and consequences of our own actions? Alot of people make fun of other people because of their race or their hair color, but can we fix this?     If we take all of the books out of the libraries that are offensive to people, they wont read about what their actions can do to people. They will think that its really not even a problem. If you want children to learn about the real world, young or old, then you have to let them live it not hold them back when something they see or read is something horrible. Children are like little adults, they dont want to see some of the bad things going wrong in the world but sometimes they have to, to understand whats really happening.      When i was about @NUM1 years old, my mom took me to the @ORGANIZATION1. Iv never been their before and it was like getting ice cream on a hot summers day. It was fun, relaxing, and very mind refreshing. Mother said she use to love going into libraries as a child, going through books like they were a new toy, except that isn't how i expierienced my first trip to the @ORGANIZATION1. This little girl who was about my age got a book off the book shelf, it wasn't the 'type' of book @CAPS2 mother wanted @CAPS2 reading, but she read it anyways. When they went to check out the little girl asked the employee, '@CAPS1 is their so many books about black people, they are just like us aren't they?' @CAPS2 mother turned @CAPS2 around and slapped @CAPS2 so hard that I was suprised she wasn't knocked out. That is censorship, the everyday problem that we all have to face but do we really listen to these problems?      Censorship is a problem but should we remove everything that is offensive to us and others? No, just because it is offensive doesn't mean we should remove it. Their will be alot of problems and people who think we should but that is their opinion and everyone has a right to an opinion. Use your voice, speak your opinion because people want to hear you. If you dont speak out then someone out their @MONTH1 be affected because of your actions.

2,"Do I believe having books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they are offensive? No I do no think they should be removed. The people have the right to see the material if they are offensive. Maybe they like seeing the offensive material.     The reason why I think they shouldn't remove the offensive material from the shelves is because people @MONTH1 find the offensive material that fascinating to read or watch. If the offensive material concludes historical violence or animal violence, then I think people should have the right to see it if it involves learning and helping that person to better understand the material. If we remove most of the offensive material then we would not have a lot of books, music, movies, and or magazines left on the shelfs.      Not a lot of people @MONTH1 find the offensive material so offensive but interesting and would maybe like to find out more about that material. You just can't take it away off the shelfs, a book if has some bad language in it, by my have one person who found it offensive to have bad language in it.      So my conclusion about offensive material being taken off the shelfs by some people who found it offensive is nonsence and they should not do that if more people find it interesting than others. It's a good learning experience for people but for a small portion of those would not get that learning experience but find it emusing have that type of material on the shelfs and think they need to take it off for others who don't like it as well. There might be one part of the movie or book that has a little part that can be offensive but the rest is fine.

If the viewer does not want to read or listen to the offenisve books or music that is exposed to the public, then viewer should not pick the offensive material up.These offensive materials have a great impact on the public. Adults @MONTH1 not want their children to pick up these uncensored materials, but that does not mean that the materials should be taken off the shelves because it is offensive to some individuals.

Libraries have a children's zone where children have their books, music, and magazines that do not have inappropriate material in them.      Children might pick up these bad materials out of bad habit. If you tell your children not to watch something then they should not watch it. If you tell your children not to read something then your children should not read it. No matter what your children are going to be exposed to these certain materials later on in life.      These offensive materials are published for a reason and its to educate the younger generations out there of what has happened in the past. For example, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and the two @CAPS5 @CAPS6. These books have great meaning behind them. The books are published so that people will not forget that past.

2,"Honestly in my opinion I don't think that anything offensive should be removed from shelves because some people like to watch or read offensive things because its either funny or they just want see people get hurt or see people get mad. Even if people don't like seeing violence or anything else that offends them at least put them in a area were they are separated from non-offensive books, etc. I also think that if they were to still try remove them then at least seperate them to were you have to be @NUM1 to go into the offensive section or whatever they feel like calling it.      Taking away offensive type genres from some teens and adults would be like taking kid stories too. It's all just a matter of opinion of what people like or how they was raised to like certain different genres of books, magazines, movies etc. Just like @PERSON1 said if you have the same right to remove a book off a shelf then so do I and so does every other person on this planet that don't like something you like. Therefore there are no more books left on the shelf for any of us, so if you take that genre of censorship then mine as well take all of them.     One thing that has happened to me before that was similar was how there was this game I wanted when I was little, it was an offensive game but it was really good and I thought it was pretty funny. It was called blitz the league and they took it off the shelves because it had to many swear words in it, and it showed alot of violence and breaking of bones in it.

2,"Libraries are an important source of knowledge in a community.  This is because every library has different books to share with the public.  Different books, vast knowledge, and never ending learning.  @CAPS1 are the qualities that a library should posses.  Although not all books are meant for all ages snd that is why libraries need to seperate books carefully.     Libraries across the world are incredibly organized, but the real question is: are they organized in the right way?  No matter how much a parent tries to forget, they still worry about their child finding a book they don't want them to read.  Libraries need more diversity in their organization system.  This means they need to seperate books through the range of age.  Some libraries have this system already but they need to make their rules clear so no one under aged gets into the section for older people.     Just as Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 words are something that every library should follow.  Libraries have a responsibility that they need to carry out and that is to deliver people knowledge and entertainment through books.  Although, over the years libraries have carried more than books over the years such as music, movies, magizines, and some have a computer center.  All of @CAPS1 things make the system even more complex and harder to maintain.       I remember when I was younger and I couldn't wait to go to the library.  The library that I grew up with is very organized and well kept.  They had everything that was needed: the kids section, the young teenager, the young adult section, and everything else after the young adult section was put in the far left corner.  It was a relatively big library and very popular to the public.  They also had competitions, mostly reading competitions, in the @DATE1 for the kids.  I have learned plenty from this library and I still look forward to the day that I return.     The main thing that I have learned about libraries through the years is that organization is a key component to a successful library.  Every library has their own system, but it  still needs to work for the public.  The library in a community serves the public and thats how t should be.",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"There are many types of music, books, movies, and other materials that you can read about life, that could very well be taken offensive to many different people in many different ways. These materials are found everywhere; in stores, libraries, schools, and more. I personally don't think they should be removed at all, for several different reasons. It helps everyone learn about life, in different aspects, and it shows the real world and how people act to each other, and how they are treated. A lot of reading materials found in places such as libraries and any type of stores, can be discriminating and sometimes racial. An abundant amount of movies, books, and magazines show off drugs, alcohol, and other things. Even though it is wrong, it's how people feel and think, and what they do. They have a right to express their feelings and actions, and it is the real world, not everything and everyone is perfect, so why lie and try to make it seem perfect?     One reason why any of these items should not be removed because its the real world, and it's what really happens. When i watch movies, and listen to music that involve drugs and alcohol it makes me think. It makes a ton of people think. To me, seeing how some of these people live their lives in a negative way, it seems that nothing goes right for them and it teaches me to not make the not so smart decisions they have made, and to live a better life. There are a lot of songs and movies that talk about racial actions, guns, wars, gangs, drugs, alcohol, etc. and it makes me and the people around me to see how the real world is. I've seen movies about gangs, and gang violence, and it makes me think how some people have to live, they have to go through all of that. Some people think its offensive, but its real life. In some non-fictional movies and books, that stuff happens, and why should we pretend like it doesn't?     Having books that talk about race or anything that could offend someone should stay on the shelves because it could either be a factual book or someone expressing their feelings. If someone is expressing their feelings, and you take the time to sit down and read the book, and see their point of view, maybe that person reading the book could understand what has happened in that persons life or expierenced and it wouldn't be so offensive. If it is a factual book, then people need to take the time and read bout the facts, and try not to take it offensive.      I personally don't think that any movies, books, music, magazines and more should be taken off shelves of any store, library, or school. Reading, listening, and watching these things will to me, benefit people. They would because it allows people to learn about what is going on in the world, even though it @MONTH1 be offensive to a race. If they didn't have these things, the world would seem perfect to some people, and desastoris to other who live in a world with gang violence and other things like that. They would feel like no one else is like them, so it could be reassuring to some people that they aren't alone. Having these things around is a learning experience to me. It keeps me out of trouble, because I can see what i could get into. These materials should remain on the shelf, even if they could be offensive.

2,"Materials in libraries that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelves. The libraries should have no control on censorship with the books, movies, music, and magazines put on their shelves.      Some one worked hard making that book or magazine to put  on the shelf. They should get the right to have that book available for people to read or look at. Finding a book offensive is one's own opinion. Offensive, dirty, scandalous, these are all just opionated words. What one might find horrible and needs to be taken down, another might find it to be the best book he or she has ever read.      Some books are graphic for younger adults and maybe even some teenagers. Removing a book from the shelf completely is not okay. Librarians could maybe limit the age required to be able to check out the book if they want to help reduce the exposure of inappropriate material to young adults. Taking a book completely off a shelf so no one can read it, not even adults, I do not agree with that at all.      Some of the graphic material in books can be a real eye opener to some people, especially if that book is based on a true story. A non-fiction story about a young girl who has been raped, beaten, and drug around is guaranteed to have graphic material not suitable for young children in some mothers' eyes. That doesn't mean that the adults who can handle this kind of imagery and the kind of language used in the book should not be able to hear her story. Also, think of the character in the book. Do you think she would want people to hear her story? Of course she would!      Life is not always pretty. It can be down right ugly and disgraceful at times. A lot of the time it is more ugly and brutal than it is beautiful. Books are a way for people to see the ugly and to experience it to such a degree with the offensive materials that they will want to make a change. In my own personal experience, books have inspired me several times to make a difference and make a change, to help someone. I have read many books and magazines with offensive material that I would usually never discuss in front of anyone. I can honestly say, that these books were probably the ones that I will remember the most because they affected me so much.      Of course, these books can have bad effects on people, giving nightmares to some, and causing others to get red in the face whether from anger or embarrassment. More importantly, I believe these uncensored books show people what life is really like, with cruel and unusual punishment.     Again, if people don't like the graphic material or the offensive language and imagery in the libraries, then they won't check out that book. There are plenty of books in the library that are not offensive and tell happy stories. If that is what the people want to read, then it is the librarian's job to steer them away from the offensive books and lead them in the right direction.     For those readers that are not afraid of the reality of life and are ready to face it, they should be able to find books in the library that give them just that. If they want an eye opener, they should have the free will and right to go into their local library and find a book containing what they are looking for.     Libraries should not censor the material that comes into their building because it is not their opinions that decide what is too offensive for people to read. The author obviously didn't find it too graphic, and the author's intention for writing that book was so that the public could read it. That privilege of checking out the book you want should be left up to the public, offensive or not.",4.0,4.0,7.0

One reason is because of some belifes other people might have for example if i see a book about worshiping the devil or something i'm not going to want my child even seeing that on a shelf in the kid section in the library.     Other examples such as reading a book based about the slavery some people might not want to see that because it brings back memories of there harsh past. Their not going to want to see pictures of there history and people being killed. Or maybe a @CAPS1 victim was watching the @NUM1 mintutes and they were interviewing another victim if i was in there situation i would change that channel because i'm not going to want to relive all that over just like the slavery. Just it's not right for some people to talk about something cause sometimes they don't even really know the whole truth.       By putting all this information together we get the conclusion of the passage being more of an opinion.

I belive that what is bad to one person isent so bad to someone else. I also think that all books and movies and evan magazines can open up a persons mind to ideas, thoughts and places they have never been.      If you don't like a library don't hold that library responsible for your veiw on the book its not the libraries fault. Being in @CAPS2 we have the freedom to look at whatever books we want to. I  think you can choose what you want to read.      Some people think some books are bad and other people think those books are amusing. If you find a book that doesn't look good to you don't let your children see it if that is the way you feel.      Some people live in a small town and never get the chance to see or experience other ways of life. Books and movies give them the chance to explore. If you took books and movies away, some people would be missing out on those experiences.      My opinion on cencership is that everyone has a right to there opinion. if you are not happy with your library then go to a different one. Everyone see's things in there own way.

2,"I do not believe that anyone has the right to censor certain materials from others. Every individual has their own idea on what they find offensive and not. To respect everyone's opinion, the censorship of material cannot happen without someone getting angry.     In @LOCATION1, each person has a right to their own ideas and opinions and to write whatever they want. As much as someone has a choice to write a book, someone else has the right to read it. When we let people censor our bookshelves, we give up our right to read whatever we want to.     What one person @MONTH1 find offensive, another person @MONTH1 not. Depending on different factors like how we were raised, when we were raised, and what kind of environment we live in, we all have different tastes and intrests, including liturature, music, and filmography. If you personally don't find a work good or you don't think it is appropriate for others then don't use it, don't promote it, and dont have it in your house or allow people living under your roof to use it. There are other steps you can take to showing your disapproval for a book other than to have it taken off shelves so others can't read it.     Some material are inappropriate. I'll admit that some movies should not be watched and some magazines make you cringe by even knowing they're out there. Some music is a bad influence as well as some book covers are plastered with sex symbols across the covers.      My brother and I recently got into an argument something like this. His favorite music is screamo and hard-core rock. I can't stand it. I dont understand how he enjoys it, and I don't like listening to it everyday when I come home from school. He, on the other hand, abhores country music, which is my preference to listen to. To him, country is the worst music ever made. I think his music should be taken away and banned, and he thinks mine should be banned. My mother doesn't like either types; she prefers classical. None of us should be able to take away eachother's type of music. We keep to ourselves and plug in our headphones.      Respect for another person doesn't just come from wanting what's best for them. It also comes from being open to their views and opinions on matters you might disagree on. You wouldn't want someone to tell you what you like is bad and that you can't listen to it anymore. The same goes if you tell someone else they're wrong for liking something. We all need to be tolerant to eachother's likes",4.0,4.0,7.0

Like some of the romatic novel that talk about sex and stuff likr that i think should now be in there but, if place in a diffrent part where only mature adilts go to then that is fine. Magizines in libaraies is on of the big problems beacusr there it a lot things in diffrent for smaller children not to see like diffrent celbiarites and body parts that should not be shown.     what i reall think that all libarabies should do is make diffrent parts of the libay and put age limits on the places you are allowed to gobut that is jus me.

2,"Everyone has their own taste. Everyone also has their own opinion's. One's opinion on book censorship though is that it should be abolished. Everyone should think it is ethically and morally wrong.     We as people have a right to choose what we read. If we allow book censorship that right would be taken away from us. Also we as @CAPS1 are big on our right's, so this book censorship should be a big no.     Another reason one thinks it is wrong is because there would be no fair way to distinguish good books from bad ones. It would be based on someone's opinion. Which we all think that basing rules on someones opinion is wrong. There would be no way everyone would agree with the books that are censored. We see this in prime example in the movie @CAPS2 @NUM1. In that movie you see books being censored and the outrage that followed.      So as you can see book censorship should not be allowed.

The right thing to do is either get a different book or do not read. The librarian will not care if its offensive to you because they are not getting paid by you they get paid by the @ORGANIZATION1.     Little kids should not be aloud in libarys if they are not with a parent. Little kids usually do not want to read anyways. This only is offensive to adults and senior citizens. If the librarian is smart and sees the book and usually would read books all day would know if its for adults or kids. Its not the kids fault if they want the book, music, movies, or magazines. A lot of kids these days do not even like reading they just do @CAPS2 when they have nothing else better to do or they do @CAPS2 for school. Kids now like violence and sreamo bands just becasuse they are rebels against their parents.     Libarys are usually not around a lot because technology is leaving @CAPS2 in the dust. If we want to look up a books, music, movies, and magazines we would just look @CAPS2 up. Everything is at our finger tips when technology is in our grasp.

You can not stop every kid and every adult from finding @CAPS2 somewhere. Since libarys are funded by the @ORGANIZATION1 you would have to go through the @ORGANIZATION1 to stop @CAPS2 not just through libarys itself. If people do decide on trying to get ride of offensive things in libarys @CAPS2 would take a long time for that to happen and when @CAPS2 does happen most of the books in libary are going to be gone because almost every book is offensive to someone.

2,"Libraries should be a good place for young children and adults to have fun. When you go to a library to want to read a book, go on the computer, look at magazines, or find movies that you  can bring home for everybody else. What should be moved from the shelves are things that aren't appropiate for young children or teens.     Little chilren love to read books when their at the library. It gives them something fun to do instead of just sitting and doing nothing. Chilren can get more education by focusing more on school and reading thingas when they do go to the library. They can bring things in school that are appropiate for show-and-tell. Books are fun to read expically if your really interested in them.     Young children read lots of books that have pictures in them because it is very interesting to see what's going on as you read. Older children tend to read books that have less pictures in them because their getting to the age they want to read bigger books. Tennagers read books about what's going on in life or maybe their favorite book that just like them. Adults read books that are more for them. Their books have things that little kid's shouldn't read unless it is appropiate for them.     Other than books, movies and magazines are also very interesting as well.

If you dont like it, then don't grab it! There are a lot of different views out there with different people and what should and should not be allowed in a library. To me, it doesnt really matter because I get to choose what I want to check out and walk out of the store or school with.

If we want to know about those things then why would people take offence to it? Everyone has a choice in life and a choice on what they want to read, listen, and watch.

2,"Do you believe that offensive materials like movies, books, music, or magazines should be removed from shelves they are found on. Personally I do think really offensive materials should be moved off the shelves. I will tell you why I know they should be taken off the shelves.     I know that offensive material such as race, names, and religon get to people. People who say, write, show, and sing things that are offensive to other knows  that they should not do it. Most people think it wouldn't be interesting if there was't anything offensive towards someone in a movie, book, music, or magazine.     I beilieve that anything that has to do with race needs to stay out of books, movies, music, magazines. A lot of people get hurt by what people say about their race and other people think it is funny but it's really not it's hurtful. It does not matter what color your skin is, it matter who you are as a person. Most people look at the color of your skin and assume who you are even though you could be the brightest, sweetest, trustworthy person they have ever met or have known. People need to take a look at what they are saying and doing that might be offensive to other people out there.      Name calling is a big issue in books, movies, magazines, and music. People are so used to name calling now days they don't even realize what they are doing or saying to one another. It just not in books, movies. magazines, and music. It's in everyday life. Name calling should quit everywhere. On movies when people call people fat and somebody watching it is bigger then the person on tv it makes them feel bad about themselves. People need to watch what they say.     Religion is another big issue used everywhere especially at school. Kids go around calling kids @CAPS1, muslims different things. Kids do not understand that other people take offense to that. It also hurts those kids because they feel weird. They were born into that religon, it is not their fault they were born that way. Just because they were born that way does not mean they are any different then anyone else.      I beileve that things people put out there that are offensive need to be taken off the shelves or wherever they are at. When people read, see, or even hear things about race, religion, and name callling it hurts them, even if they don't want to admit to it.

2,"Have you ever read a book and wished that you had never picked it up in the first place? I have. I believe there is different censorships we should take upon people according to their age limit. Today I'm going to be persuading you on keeping censorships in school libraries.      When I was younger my mother had shelves and shelves of books that were all in order according to the types of plots they contained. I remember that the top shelf was romance novels. I was not allowed to touch them but one day I went against her word and shifted through some. Some of the chapters were extremely graphic and left me red-faced when my mother found out what I had read. Needless to say it was awkward and it fast-forwarded 'the talk' by a good five years. I ended up truly regretting even looking at it.     First, I believe elementary school libraries should be censored the most. By censorship I mean removing any books that contain foul language and graphic scenes of violence or nudity. This is common sense that a child of such a young age should not be exposed to such things. Small children are very innocent and tend to act upon anything and everything they see, read, or hear. It is best for their well-being that they aren't yet exposed to these things.     Second, I believe that middle school libraries should also have censorship, but one of a lower degree. At this age most children are growing into pre-teens and therefore becoming more curious about the things around them. They are maturing but still naive. I think at this age anything with sexual references should be kept on a lock. It is obvious that this is the time that they will be most curious about these things but it is not something they should learn about from a book. They are not at a level of maturity to take it seriously without making mistakes because their hormone levels are out of wack.      Thirdly, I believe high school libraries should have the lowest amount of censorship. At this age students are nearing adulthood and therefore more aware of violence, sex, foul language, and offensive language but not so young that they will act upon something just because they have read it in a book. This is the age of learning. Learning about the world and learning about people. As they are nearing the level of adulthood they should be exposed to everything that they can in a safe enviroment otherwise they will try to learn about it in other ways that could be harmful.     In conclusion I believe there should be certain levels of censorship in our school libraries. Hopefully you will all take this into account and possibly even limit the types of things your own child is exposed to in the future. Remember, sometimes there will be books that you will wish you had never picked up",4.0,4.0,7.0

There are many people out there that have different interest and like different things and also think different things are offensive. If you took all the @CAPS2's or magazines off the shelves that are offensive to one  person you could have a big mess on your hands. People are going to become infuriated with you.

One family @MONTH1 think that a comedy movie is bad, but another family @MONTH1 think it is alright to watch it and doesn't see any problem with it.

2,"I believe libraries should organize the books by maturity level, not age or grade. If a book, magazine, movie, etc., is found offensive to one person, that does not mean that every other person who encounters that same book will also be offended by it. I agree with @PERSON1 when she says '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' because not everyone thinks or understands the same way. It is impossible to please every person any single library will encounter.     If media is organized and seperated by maturity level, then the only thing a person can complain about if they see something they find offensive is not being able to locate the area their brain can handle. Often, people are offended by things they do not understand in the first place. Another reason people can be offended is because they don't know as much as they think they know about the subject matter of the said media source. I @MONTH1 want to remove a book you anxiously intended on reading. Because I was offended by it, you no longer have the opportunity to read that book.     I also do not belive libraries should be organized by age. For example, there are some people in my grade who can read @PERSON2 without a problem. I, on the other hand, can not because my brain doesn't understand @CAPS1 writing as well as others in my grade. Another reason libraries should not organize by age is, for example, because no adult has the right to tell a ten-year-old child he or she can't read a certain book because the adult doesn't think the child is old enough to understand what the book is about.     I firmly believe that if libraries are going to give any random person the right to remove books which they find offensive, then they should allow babies and other young children to lie down in the middle of the library and scream and cry and kick and throw their own temper-tantrums. Why won't library managers allow that to happen? Because the library is meant for any and every one to be able to come in and help themselves to what it is that they need on their own. They're not like fast-food restaraunts, where if an item doesn't sell well enough due to buyers' disapproval, it is removed.That wouldn't be fair to those buyers who did approve.     In conclusion, I believe media should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. I do, however, believe that if libraries were to do this, they would simply shut down because libraries aren't meant to accomodate just one person. They are for the public altogether, and for those who don't like it, they just shouldn't go to the library at all. For example, I'm sure libraries won't shut down just because a @CAPS2-@CAPS3 didn't like the section about the @CAPS4.",4.0,4.0,7.0

2,"Censorship. Some people like it, others don't.      I feel like censorship should used in some places and some places I think its okay to not use it. Places where I feel it should be used include, papirazzi taking dirty pictures of people, books talking about violence and hatred, music with lyrics that are unbearable, and magazines that influence children to do what they are doing. More and more children are listening to music that belittles women and talks about drugs, sex, and violence. All these examples have a negative influence on everyone. My mom always tells me to listen to the music as if my grandparents were in the room with me. I wouldn't want them to hear all the negatives in the music I listen to. I left out movies because movies have ratings. I know a lot of people don't go by the ratings though, I believe that parents should monitor what their children watch. They should also read the ratings on video games. Video games are growing popular and popular day by day. A lot of the youth play games that I'm not even allowed to play yet! All this shooting, stealing, and brutally killing people games are way too much for a six year old to be playing. They're only getting to see the dark side of life with these games and not the good. I haven't even began to talk about the worst of all. Computers. Yes, computers. Computers are great to have when you want to look up something, but they are also a burden because of all the filth they have on it. Kids are so technologically advanced that they could probably find about anything they wanted to.  Computers don't have any privacy whatsoever. Facebook and @CAPS1 can get a lot of people in trouble because they have no privacy. This is why I don't have an account on either of them. Cell phones are also a problem. Texting while driving, sexting, and prank calling people can get someone in a whole heap of trouble. Combining the computers and cell phones is just a disaster in your hand. I think it is sad when their are commercials for get out and play an hour a day.

2,"Libraries of @CAPS1     Do I think that libraries have the right to disallow what comes into them, absolutely. I strongly believe that libraries should fill  their shelves with a vast variety of material. On the flip side though, I also believe that libraries should have some control over what they are allowed to have on their shelves. If I was able to have control over what was put into the library, I would try as hard as I can to keep that material out of there.     I would want to keep the certain materials out of my library due to the certain fact of what is it trying to promote? That illegal activites are for the cool kids, or that if you do certain stuff you will become famous. That is not the right way to go about your business in this world. Although, that happens quite often, it isn't the way you should go about living your life.     I will also say that some books that are most likely in ever library across the nation should stay.  As the on for '@ORGANIZATION1' that book should stay in libraries no matter what. Due to the fact that it doesn't lie about the past at all. It shows you how the what those times were like, and how people went about there ways. Sure you can make that arguement that they have fowl language, but thats how it was. Of which, thats what makes that book a classic, and why it should stay.      Another arguement people could make is that it is a public building, and that anything or everything should be in it. Though that is true why would the people running the libraries due such a thing. Why would they waste there time to make the libraries a safe place, so that they can tear it apart by putting bad material in it. It would never happen that way. Even if you were to walk into the library @CAPS1, you would most likely see either older people or little kids. And @NUM1 out of @NUM2 times they would most likely not want to see that material on the shelves at the library.     So as years go on libraries might change their content of the library, but they might not. If libraries allow for that to happen you would have to ask yourself is this, what is society coming to if they allow bad material to be put into the libraries?Though it is not a question anyone would want to answer, it is one that some one will have too",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"There are way to many complaints in parent's kid's  libraries about books, movies, magazines, and etc that many parents dont like. But I dont think personally that they need to be removed or anything. For an example if the parent dosent like the book then they should see if the book can get move to a different section for older kids or even to the adult section. So as you @MONTH1 see there are complaints about things that should not be in our libraries that I think should and here are some of my examples why.     First off if there are complaints about something that is in our libraries then there needs to be more then one report on it, not just one. Like for instance get more people to agree with you on why they don't wont there kid to read that book. Then once you get enough people have a meeting in the libray about that book and why you dont wont it in there.Then if you get votes or people to agree have the book turned in and it checked then if the head people agree then they can remove the book. So that is one thing you can do.     My second reason is what if the kid likes the book but the parent dose'nt what do you do? Ask the librarin to put lables on the section like for another example, make one side about sports books and then maybe the other side can be about horror or crime. Then the parent can tell there kid or kids what section to not look at and to look at. I say this because different parents @MONTH1 have different thoughts on what book they want there kid or kids reading. So that would be my second reason.     Now my third and final reason on what the parent can do is just dont do anything. Now I know that sounds very dumb and stuff but really just dont do anything. I say that because if they find it interesting to read or watch at least there learning and will like it. Except if its like a rated @CAPS1 movie or something, or a book only for adults. Now that is when you don't let them read it or watch it .But eventually kids are going to get older and as they get older there going to want to read stuff that many parents do not want them to read. But the parents should just let them but keep a close eye on what there reading in watching and explain it to them if they have a question or something. So that would be my final reason.     So in conclusion them are some things parent can do if they don't want there kid or kids reading or watching a certain thing that is in there libray. Like have a meeting or get votes to get a book passed on not getting read. Or have the books labeled section by section. Or even my final reason just let them read it. So them are my thoughts and opinions on what parent can do if they don't want there kid or kids reading or watching a certain book or movie and there libray",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"No I don't think music, movies, etc., should be removed from the shelves at the library. Those things are not doing anything to people who are not interested in them. That is just like trying to removed nonfiction books because you don't read them. Someone watches those movies, read those magazines, and listens to that music. That is unfair to all of the people who takes those things to their interest.     I want to know why do people want those things remove from the shelves. What did magazines and movies do to them? Those people have no consideration for other people. Those people are just thinking about themselves. Some people look forward to reading one of those magazines or watching one of those movies everyday",2.0,3.0,4.0
2,I am writing a persuasive essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship.     I think if a book has so much censorship in it that it then needs to be put in a section where only people at the right age should be able to view it. Cause I know I would not appreciate my kid looking at a book or anything with censorship in it.      I've read a book that had censorship in it and I would not aprove for my child to read it or anyones child too either. If I had the choice the censorship books should only be sold or viewable at a certain place for the mature person that is old enough to view it.     I think if an author can write a book with censorship in it and he/she mst not care about the younger kids or there own if they have any. So I hope they wouldn't aprove it for there child to read. Then why should my child?      I really hope that an author would consiter my statements cause it would make me upset if I was a parent and I know it would make my mother or father upset to know I read a book with censorship in it if I was younger and I know it would make any other parent upset to see or know that there child has or had to read a book with censorship in it,3.0,2.0,3.0
2,"When you look at the books of @DATE1, do they look offensive to you?    Mankind has found that books that people enjoy are the offensive ones. The reason for this is probaly because when a person reads something of non-offensive, the story to them would be less entertainable to them. Humans tend to find offensive stories to most liking, since they find them more funny, but when you have children, I don't think you'd want them to have that book or they might pick up the wrong idea. People also find that music with offensive things tend to be better then regular non-offensive music.   The offensive type of music, we usally find mainly is rap or rock music. Rap is very offensive on mutliple accounts, on how it gives women a crudy name in society or how it show most of the african society on how life should be, @CAPS1!!!! Rock music is offensive in several way. The genres of rock are @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and @CAPS2. Rock talks about drugs are the way to go or @CAPS3 you believe in is a @CAPS4!!! Everything we really listen to has some sort of offens in it, no music is safe anymore, thats for sure.    The movies of @DATE1 are tainted with offensive evil, such as women descrimination or teaching teens about sex, drugs and, drink is the best way to enjoy life. Mankind movies are slowly become more and more offensive to everything that we think is right. When those born for this new year see these new founded shows, they begin to draw the mental new image of whats the new right and bad wrong. The new right is about drugs and sex is the best thing to do and the new wrong is to not avoid things that might harm your life style or the way people view you in society, they see nothing about you in good ways.     Things in this world are harmful and offensive to all that we know or like. Human have adapted to this founded life style of complete destruction. Mankind has turned our once most powerful brain into mush and sketched out a new crudy image for use to believe in.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"My opinion is @LOCATION1 should not take books, music, movies, magazines,etc., of the shelves or take them of shelves of stores. Reason why is because everybody or at least @NUM1 person has the likes and dislikes and some people might be offened but other might like the book that the others are offended by. The people that offended shouldn't just read the book and leave it alone. With music they have edited version for parents that don't allow cursing, or swearing in their house. Another is I think censorship should be banned because people should mature and grow A sense of humor because eventually in life you will hear these words. Some books also have racist terms in them like the books about the slaveship usually has the @CAPS1 word in it and most of the time that word is used in rap/hip hop alot and most of them are everyday words for people.     Also @NUM2 out of @NUM3 children, or parents will most likely hear these words sometime or some point of their life. They could hear it in the car, outside, home, stores, movies, and most likely in schools. I know where I grew up at and where I also live I hear alot of words that are bad everyday. Its somewhat a part of life and you will hear it. Also alot of teenagers listen to music and watch music videos, and will hear the cursing and the swearing in the lyrics. A few months in the past I did A debate @CAPS3 about banning parental advisory and censorship And the @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 says that no citizen should be aborted from what they have to say.     Now A days rap/hip hop has changed and people dont really pay attention to the lyrics or whats said in song, or the meanings, for example @PERSON1 calls herself a bad @CAPS4 and most teenage girls idolize her and they also say what she says but little do they know they're calling theirselves the @CAPS4 word. Also with freshman lyricist/rappers they mostly talk about sex, money, and drugs which is not the everday life for an average citizen but most teenagers idolize those rappers and want to be exactly like them so they follow what artist false claim and lie about they are and the teenagers go outside doing those type of things they say. My opinion stays the same but the only thing i think that should get censored or removed is the things that people talk about like sex, money, drugs unless they're against it and trying to prove a point to the young adults.     Now you know my opinion and what i think about censorship/parental advisory and if the things people get offended by should be taken off. It will stay the same and the people thats offended by the things thats wrote, said, or spoken about just walk away or don't listen to any of it and find something that fits you and that you enjoy its over a million books and you can at least find @NUM1 that you like and that you can share with relatives, friends, or associates. But think about it some of those words can expand your vocabulary or even relate to you in some sort of way. But whatever you don't like everyone else doesn't have to not like it. Just enjoy another book, music, movie, or magazine.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"For the past twenty years, @LOCATION1's children have become more and more susceptible to bad choices. Violence and other bad choices of growing children has led to more problems in the @CAPS1 society. While some of these problems could go back to the parents, these problems could also go back to what children see and hear. This includes books, movies, music, magazines, and other forms of media. So what can people, including parents, do to prevent a harmful upbringing of children?     Movie ratings have helped to somewhat prevent underage children and teenagers from seeing films that include inappropriate content for their age. However, some movies are not correctly rated, allowing children to watch the films that include profanity, sexual content, and violence. With this happening, this allows children to learn about all of the bad choices people make in the world. Children follow after role models that they see in movies, and if they see that celebrities make bad choices, whether in movies or in real life, they will also start to make those bad choices. To help prevent children from seeing inappropriate movies, those who decide the rating of the movie should come up with new standards on which to rate the movies.     Movies should not be the only media source that should recieve a maturity rating. Books, magazines, and music should also include ratings. Books, as well as music, can include content such as violence, and sexual references. Magazines provide information about the lives of celebrities, good and bad, and also include pictures that are sometimes questionable. When children go to the store with their parents and they check out, usually their first observation is of the candy. Most stores place magazines, some with covers unsuitable for children, next to the candy. This can cause children to get bad impressions of what their life is supposed to be like.     When people go to buy books, magazines, movies, and music, they should have to be of a certain age to buy certain media products. This could help stop spread the amount of innocent children that are harmed by the sights and sounds of @CAPS1 media. As soon as children stop learning about violence and other bad choices, @LOCATION1 will become a better nation, both in safety, and in morality.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censoring and removing books from the shelves of libraries has been a major issue for some time now.  The idea of censoring a book is made to change things such as slang words or sayings that @MONTH1 offend people.  Some groups @MONTH1 even want the book removed from the shelf due to its ideas or beliefs.  The act of censoring or removing a book from a library shelf @MONTH1 satisfy your feelings, but hurt anothers.     Censored books is a writers worst fear.  Now you @MONTH1 think that all books are censored before being published, but this is not true.  All books are edited; which means that they are checked over and over again for mistakes such as spelling, or grammar and many other trypes of errors.  Censoring a book is taking the ideas of the storyline and altering them to fit one persons needs.  This act takes away from how the author has intended you to read it.  The way it was put on the shelf is the way the author wants you to take it in.     Removing a book from a library shelf is even worse.  When a book is removed from a shelf in any library around the country, or even the world, the author is notified of it and why it was removed.  This is the same as an artist hanging one of his most prized paintings in his studio and someone coming in and throwing it away because they didn't like the color scheme.  If a book is removed from a shelf, the person who wanted it to be removed is insulting the author for what they believe or know. This should not be allowed.     Many years of research have been funded to find out what causes people become offended to a point where the want a book removed from the shelf, or altered in its ideas.  The three main causes of this are: beliefs in religion, politics and sex.  Researchers are still unsure why people are so upset about these vast topics, but they are working diligently stop it.     Trying to remove a book from a library shelf is like taking a new car off a car lot because you didnt like the interior.  It simply is not right!  Books are written as the author feels they should be written; and they should stay that way.  Censorship and removal of books in libraries across the country should be stopped.  Does it make you feel good when you try to change what someone has already done?",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"In this essay i will tell you my views on why the books should stay on the shelvs of the library even if they are offensive or not. I will also tell why it is a bad idea to have them, and give you different options to use for the libraries that have offensive music, books, magazines ect.     In my oppion i do not think that the offensive books should be taken off of the shelves from the library. On the other hand, i think that having offensive books, music, magazines, and everything elese is a very bad idea to have in a librarie, just because it is a public place. Another way to maybe take care of the solution and have everyone happy is: @CAPS1 the books that are found offensive on a different shelve and have that shelve labled. This way, moms and dads can watch there kids on were they go to look at a book. They wont have to be worried about there child looking at a book that is found inproperate, or bad in any means. You could also take care of the situtation by putting a completley different room for adults only, or an age limite to enter the room. Personaly i have not found or experianced any offensive books, movies, music, or magazines in my time at being in the library. I do not know how bad that they come, so that is why i think that my idea on seperating the offensive books from the childerns books would be a good idea. This would help out many concerned parents. This could also lead into, having the different age group books in the libraries seperated. This way it could be easyer to find a book that would be for you. Or for you child.      This is what i think should happen among the libraries. This would most deffently help out the parents that think the offensive books should be taken out compeltey. It wuld also help the people that like the offensive books to come back to the library. This is an idea that would make everyone happy.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Have you ever been at a library and you seen a book on the shelf that you dont exactly agree with? Did it make you upset? In this essay I will give you my point of view on what I think should be aloud in any public library.     A library is a place where anyone can go and use the resources there to find information on any topic. In a library there are some things in there that should and should not be censored. Books or magazines that have no racism evident in the text or any other kind of discrimnating in them is okay for a public library. The reason I believe this is because there are people in the worl that will take this offensive. We don't know about everybodys beliefs and the way they was raised. Movies that I believe is appropiate for a public library is basically the same for books and magazines. For music, it is the librarys choice and the people looking for it. If you dont want the music then don't get it.     Stuff that should be not aloud in the libraries is books about things that have happened in our history. Peoples ancestors could have been involved in that and it could be a sensitive subject to them. Magazines on the other hand is a different story. Magazines should be aloud to be there regardless because people like to keep up on current events and stuff like that. Movies, they should keep movies out of librarys and they should make the people order them online.     In conclusion, it is ultamitly the librarys choices for what they want in there library. People will still have to deal with stuff like that, there is racism and discrimination everywhere and we will never get away from it.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I think that people should not have restritions on there moveis or anything eles. There should not be restrtions on movies, songs, and magazines. Movies should have no restrtions.     Movies are good just how they are. @CAPS5 of them can be better. Like having more war violence in history flims, like @CAPS1 @PERSON1, or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Because they need to show how dangerous it really can be and how we should support the troops that fight for our freedom. Movies can be good if the restritions are lifted.         @CAPS5 songs speak the @CAPS6 and the @CAPS6 should be heard. @CAPS5 songs are disbanded destroyed because one song tells the @CAPS6 about something small. For example @CAPS5 songs during the @LOCATION1 ear were disbanded because they sang on why we shouldn't be in @LOCATION1. Most of those songs were right to. Songs help us deal with most of the @CAPS6 that is going on in the world. @CAPS5 songs tell else the @CAPS6 nothing eles.     Magazines can't tell the @CAPS6 all the time either. Magazines are checked by most @CAPS7 and they need to have the @CAPS6 eith them without censorship or restritions. They sometime sugar coat a lot of things. Like they tell people that a famous celebrite has not been doing drugs when its easy to tell that they are using them. Magzines should tell the @CAPS6 about a lot of things. @CAPS5 I can't tell you because there is a censorship or restrition in the paper that I'm sending this to.           Censorship can be an important downfall of the people of the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell lies to protect us. Well @CAPS5 people like me want to hear only the @CAPS6",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"I believe that no book should be taken off the shelf if it is offensive. Everybody has their own preferences to books, movies, etc. i think it is unnacceptable if the government can take something that someone likes reading because it is offensive to a certain type of people. If someone thinks the book is offensive than why pick it up and try taking it off the shelf, because someone else might like that book.      Everyday people hear stuff that is offensive. But it is how they handle it that matters. The childish ones act like a fool, and the mature ones just let it go because they know its not worth it. I believe that you need to be at a certain maturity level to read some books, because younger kids might act like what the character does in the book, or say bad language because they think it is appropriate.     If we had censorship in everything that we see, the world would be a whole lot different. I think it would be different because movies or anything that does not have offensive stuff in it is usually boring and not that funny. We deserve to have the right to not have censorship, and if you are a parent and don't want your child watching something in particular, set a lock on the channel. I say this because everybody has different preferences for what their family watches.     There are many different views on censorship, but mine is to not have censorship on everything offensive, partly because sometimes the truth can hurt, but it makes the world not seem like a great place that has nothing wrong with it. So all-in-all, i think people should be the ruler of censorship because they know what they like and don't like.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"There are certain aspects of offensive literature that probably should be removed from libraries rather than let them stay on the shelves, because they can spread negative ideas and morals. For instance, books from the @DATE1's might have books that have to do with how people felt about slavery or how they treated others. While it is a reference source in history, it should only be used with great care because some people @MONTH1 acquire a negative way of thinking from reading it. So maybe books with that kind of a topic could be stored in a seperate part of the building of a library for research purposes.      There are some books that are wrongfully censored because the person in charge believes that it is improper or the wrong kind of message. In some cases though that @MONTH1 not be the true, but merely a conflict of views and that doesn't make the book wrong. Other books are censored for the right reasons because they @MONTH1 hold information on how to do something against the law or tell about discrimination against a certain type of people. Censorship is a good way to keep things with a message to spread negative thinking low.     Another thing you might find being censored in a library is music, due to the lyrics or the message. In music people @MONTH1 use profanity in their lyrics which is common in a lot of different forms of music now. Libraries don't usually like to keep around music with such lyrics and might be guilty of removing those songs from their collections or never procurring them at all. Lyrics can also deliver messages that a library might deem unfit to be heard by the public because it involves shooting or drinking and drugs.     Movies might also be censored while they are inside a library. Movies come with a rating system, @CAPS1. G, @CAPS2, @NUM1, @CAPS3-rated, etc. These ratings are made for the audience, so that those who @MONTH1 not be mature enough for its content cannot watch it. So movies that are @CAPS3-rated @MONTH1 not be available to people under @NUM2 since that is the required age to view such a movie.     I think that materials in libraries are censored with good judgement and are taken from the shelf for a reason. Sometimes a book, a movie, a song, or whatever it @MONTH1 be, is removed for its own message being offensive or inappropriate. It is for these reasons that censorship can be a good thing to use, so that we dont spread negative thinking amongst our peers. However that does not mean we can just remove a book from our libraries at any time if we just so choose, that is an abuse of power, and so censorship should be only used with great care",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I enjoy reading many books at our local library all the time. I go there often and sit down and read a book recommened by the librarian. Reading takes up a large amount of my free time. I have read a variety of different books from '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to 'A @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4'. Both books I have mentioned are banned in certain libraries.      The title escapes me, but another book I have read was about the government censoring literature. I think the author's name was '@PERSON1'. The ironic part was that this book was also banned in certain libraries. I really liked reading the book, but the problem was that it was banned in my library too. I don't believe in a society where people can remove materials from shelves if they're found offensive.     One of the problems with censorship, is that anything can be found offensive. For example, you can have a nonfiction book about the theory of evolution. Some religious people @MONTH1 find this book blasphemous based on their beliefs. You @MONTH1 also have a book dealing with atheism. Most of the other religions are against this and therefore makes it offensive. The examples can go on and on.     Music comes in many forms. Metal gets one of the worst reputations in music because of the sub-cultures associated with it. Some people see it as music, others see it as a form of brainwashing the masses into doing bad actions. People cannot decide what is 'good' music or what is 'bad' music it is an opinion.     I understand that some materials aren't for children, but that is why there is a ratings system for music, magazines and movies. That is also why some libraries have an older audience section for the adults and one specifically for children. In these ways they prevent children from accidentally checking out materials that society feels that they shouldn't hear, read, or see. That really isn't censorship because those materials are still there, but require the child to be with an adult who give permission to what their child wants to see, hear, or read.        What some might find offensive, will seem like ordinary materials to everyone else. There's no set list in everyone's mind on what is and what isn't offensive. There will never be an agreement with everyone on what materials to remove. It is a black or white area; you either pick one or the other. I disagree with censorship in libraries.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe that depending on the information and historical facts the book gives, I think it doesn't matter how offensive the book or movie is as long as it sends the right message.      In today's day and age, young children are more open to things like violence and sex with resources like movies, video games, and even books at their own library. Some of these forms of violence can be unharmful with the right precautions, but some @MONTH1 be too much for children. I will state in this essay the content, how much, and things to prevent when our children are reading books.    Content is something you might not find by looking at the cover or the breif descripition on the back of the book. It's something the parents or guardians might have to look into. There is a possibilty that some of the librarians even might not know the content of the books. The only thing you can do as a parent is just do some research. If you are worried ,even a little bit, that a book might be harmful to children, get on the internet and do some research on the book. Look at some of the past books the author has wrote and then look up reviews on the book as well.          Now the real question is is how much of these more mature books can our children handle? Well it depends on how much your children reads. If your child is a frequent reader, make sure you are keeping track of what they read and how long they read each day. Also make sure they aren't reading too much. If they reading one of those more mature books then tell them to take their time on it and ask questions about it. This could really help your child understand why these books are like this and how it could help them to read in the future.     Now if you are harmful of your child's books of choice then there are ways to prevent them for reading those. You can put them around an enviroment where they are maybe open to reading different books. You can also show them different kinds book that are maybe less harmful to them. You can also just simply talk to them and tell them that book @MONTH1 not be suited for them at that time. Also make sure you child understands the reason why they are being able to read that book as well. Children are going to ask why and you should be able to have a good anwser for them.     Books help grow the brain and really open into a new vocabulary. Regardless whether you read one book every few months or your reading a new book every few weeks, they are good sources of learning at any age. Espically children. That's why children should be able to read these more violent books because it can teach them vocabulary skills and overall life lessons. It can help students into a whole new relm of books they can read and enjoy. Children are maturing more and more, but you must give them time to grow and help them along the way",4.0,4.0,7.0

I think that if the people are offended by the book they should simply not read it because there might be someone that comes along and like it .As for the children I feel that the parents should warn them about the books but, they should be happy that they want to read because reading expands your vocabulary .                           I know if I was an aurthor I would be extremely angry if someone took my book off the shelf. Books sometimes take years to make and edit. We should all consider how taking the book away would affect everybody . Maby if it was a childrens book it'll have a bad impact on them like instead of reading they would get into more trouble. kids already dont have enough ways to express themselves but thats just my opinion.                                         I kind of know how the authors would feel if their books got taken off the shelf because im writing a book now I've been writing it for a year now and im still not done so when I get finished and get it published I would feel like it was all for nothing if someone decided to take it off the shelf.                                      I agree with Katherine if people could take books off the shelf ultimantly we would'nt have any books to read because everyone has there own opinoin and everyone feels different . That would leave us without any books for the younger generations to come .

They think that some movies that are rated @CAPS1 or even @NUM1 shouldnt be sold in libraries. Music with a couple of bad words. Books and magazines that talk about sex and drugs. Ya maybe these are not the best things to be talking about or showing, but some people learn off of this and they love this kind of stuff and if they were take it away then i think that would just be totally wrong. These things are what make people money. People like to watch good movies and a lot of those movies are not the best rated ones so you couldnt just take that stuff away.

If we censor books, magazines and movies/ shows, how are children/adults going to be able to learn about rasicm, and the cold harsh truth, and corecting mistakes. If everybody would stop trying to sugar coat things and trying to avoid the truth we would not have problems like the one at hand.     Learning about the truth. We can not hide the fact that people of diffrent ethinticites were given difrent names based on the color of thier skin. We can not hide the fact that bad things happen and that acts of terroism have ben preformed. By banning books, moves/shows and magizines this is what we do. the best possible thing that we could do is to keep those books alive!, so that people can learn from past mistakes and try to make this world a better place, not by trying to make everybody happy but by learning and not making the same mistakes, and that is the only way we can do this.     Avoiding the truth. Sure we can make everyone happy for a little while by doing this. However if we do this we can not, and will not solve the problem and correct the way people think, and act. For several years people have avoided the truth about many of things and there are informative documtery's and several books that cover these subjects, but because of the language that is used people want to have them banned. This is not fair to the people that wish to learn about these topics.     Censorship and the importance of knowledge. people who often want to have things cencored, wish so because a lack of knowledge on the subject. If there were more books or shows that people would watch/read they would learn from thier mistakes of censorship.      One could not stress this point enogh.

2,"The idea of censorship is indeed helpful in some aspects of literature, such as in the printing of school newspapers, yearbooks, and magazines. After a work has been revised, edited and displayed on shelves in communities, everyone has a right to read it, and authors have the right to keep it on the market due to thier freedom of speech. Censorship in libraries to avoid offence is not realistic. Also, anyone @MONTH1 find offence from anything they wish to be offended by, and therefore, if there are many people who are offended by what they read, libraries will be left with nothing. Finally, if someone realizes something will be offensive in what they pick up at the library, they always have the choice not to pick it up.     The idea of using censorship in libraries is unrealistic. Shelves would be left with nothing, and knowledge would not flow freely. Say that someone did not like @ORGANIZATION1 and decided to rid it from the library, the poetry, the stories, everything would be lost. Students could not use a library book to help them with school work, and anyone who wished to study @ORGANIZATION1's works in a deeper context, would not have the resources. Also, if something like @ORGANIZATION1 would be removed from libraries, scholars would lose their look into the past, unable to study the language of @CAPS1 society and the ideas and lifestyles formed there. Something like this example would happen with many books and magazines, @CAPS2 and music, leaving us with nothing, and with no insights to other thoughts and ideas. There would be no exposure to new ideas and therefore no chance to learn. Just because a few people might agree that a material is a bad read or @MONTH1 influence someone in an undesirable way, does not mean that it will be bad for all people. What it comes down to is a matter of opinion and what one does with the knowledge they collect from a certain material.     Secondly, there is the matter that people can choose what to be offended by. Depending on the values they want to keep and whether or not they are willing to be influenced a certain way, will change their view. Take, for example, religion. If an athiest walks into a library and decides the @CAPS3 is offensive, @CAPS4 will be left with nothing. @CAPS4 will not find the @CAPS3 offensive, but on the contrary will want to share its good news with people who haven't heard the story of @CAPS6 becoming man to save the people @CAPS7 loved with a passion incomprehensible to the human mind. There is no way to keep from offending someone through a work of litereature. Different backgrounds and ideas will have caused different people to have contradicting ideas. There is not one film, song, book, or magazine in which someone will not be offended. In a teen magazine, what one girl might see as helpful beauty tips, another girl might see as a message saying she's not pretty enough to be seen by a boy. She could change her views to something different so she might not be offended by an article about beauty. Being offended is a mind game. Do you want to be offended by a particular subject? Or can you approach it with a different point of view?     Finally, instead of the option to change one's views, a person has the option of not picking up an offensive piece of literature in the first place. Through their work, authors try to convey messages, and if the public decides they don't want to hear a certain message, they have the choice to not pick up the book and leave it for someone who does want to hear it. Authors do not worry about the people they offend, but rather hope they can reach out to someone through their words. If someone writes a bad review on a piece of fiction I wrote since I am an author, my first responce would be '@CAPS8 did you read it if you knew you wouldn't like it?' No one is left without the option of putting down a book once they've been offened. In ancient @LOCATION1, @CAPS9 offended many with the words @CAPS7 spoke, contradicting what they were being told about @CAPS6. @CAPS7 offered new ideas of a loving @CAPS6, a life in @CAPS12 with him for eternity where everything was as it should have been before sin entered the world. There is no denying that @CAPS7 offended people, and they could have chosen to stay home instead of flocking to hear him speak. They could ignore his movement and decide not to listen to what @CAPS7 had to say. A library should be like this. It should be a place filled with ideas, many ideas which some people @MONTH1 not want to accept. Therefore, everyone is benefited by having the choice to read what they want to read.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a ridiculous idea because there is no way to not offend someone. To find something that is not offensive to anyone would be impossible. Therefore, the best way to structure a library is with a plethra of choices, filled with offensive literature expressing ideas someone @MONTH1 not like. In the end, who knows? One might actually benifit from hearing some good news they thought was bad. Censored libraries would be doing no favors.",5.0,4.0,8.0
2,"In my opinon, books should never be taken down from the shelves of any library; no matter what the circumstance @MONTH1 be. The books should simply get placed in a different section. If you find yourself offended by a book; close it and return it.     Books have been around for hundreds of years. They are ment: to persuade, entertain, or inform someone about a specific topic. I have read plenty of books and i'v never seen a book as offensive. If the library took away every book that has offended someone else, how many books would we have left sitting up right on the shelves.      Libraries usually have sections dedicated to types of writing split up into age groups. The 'less offensive' or 'not offensive at all' books are found here. The higher the age goes the more detailed, exotic, and serious the manner gets. The worker of the libraryl: wouldn't allow your child to rent a book out that he did not think the student could handle.     Books are written and published for a reason. The author takes pride in his or her work. Who has the authority to take someone elses work of literature down from the shelves. Books are not ment to be offensive, to anyone. Therefore, read a couple paragraphs inside the story you wish to check out before you actually check the it out.      In conclusion, I believe strongly, that not a single book should be taken down from the shelves of a library simply because it offends one or two readers.",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Have you ever gone into a library and thought wow why is this book allowed to be placed on the shelves? Most people have been in this situation many times before and realize that the libraries can not take every negative book of the shelves, but more of this problem could be solved.  Everyone knows that not all books are bad some are used towards positive things like entertainment, education, and have a variety of different purposes.     A few years ago, I took my six year old little brother with me to the public library to check out books for him to read for pleasure.  When we had reached the children's section where he would sit down calmly and search for a book, it dawned on me that I should be looking around to see what type of books are in the environment where he is sitting.  The first book he picked up was about @PERSON1 but to my dismay the very next book contained graphic and mature pictures and descriptions.  I immediately saw my little brothers eyes light up in fear.  He was utterly confused on the pictures he had just seen, and even more confused as to why this book was in his section. After he closed the book, I then told him that what he had seen was not appropriate and to be careful what he was reaching for.     This type of situation happens every day in public libraries.  Public libraries are made to be family friendly, but by putting derogartory books on the shelves parents and children are gaining the wrong message.  When a child grabs for a book on a shelf, they are reaching into a world which they have not yet experienced.  The child could accidentially grab a graphic book and be put into a uncomfortable position they have not ever been put through before.  When a child feels scared or insecure they will allow what happened to them in that instant to effect them in the future.      Public libraries do not need the image that they contain derogatory books that are not children and family friendly.They need books to help children grow and experience postive things that will impact the way they live there life.  Putting a negative book on the shelf runs the risk of that child being impacted in a negative way, while they are still growing and developing. Books are very useful tools to help children in experiencing things and help them to slowly gain information about the process of life.  Public libraries create a family friendly environment that children can be in and parents feel comfortable bringing their child to the public library.       If these negative influential books continue to be put on the shelves families are going to be chased away from public libraries and will try to find books some other place.  As a nation we need to take a stand and stop the spread of inappropriate books in libraries.  This can be simply solved by doing a book review about that specific book before placing it on a shelf.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"In school students are there to learn. Books should not be removed from the shelter, but music should be. Now in this days music talks about sex, money, and alcohol. Sometimes the music even talks about the devil. We all know that all of those things are bad for our children. They are sent to school lo learn, not to hear music that will make them do things they are not supposed to do. Music can influence anyone to what wrong things.      Music has changed alot, now most of the music that students get to hear talk about having sex. Some students by hearing this they are more likely to be tempted to do  what the song says, they believe that is going to be nice and cool, just like the songs says. But that is not what it ends up being. They end up with their girl pregnant and they won't talke care of the baby. Students should just focus on whats good for them, they need to get good grades and to go to collage, they should worry about their future.      The music from now also talk about money. They believe money is everything, money is not everything! It's not as importat as they show it in the videos. Now in the videos they throw money, and they even show their dimonds they have. Students want to be like the famous people, but we are all different. We shouldn't really look at them as a roll model because all they are promoting in the videos is sex, money and alcohol.     How good is alcochol for you? Well, alcohol it's not the best thing for you to drink we all know that alcohol is like a drug, once you try it you'll like it and there is not really a way to stop it. Alcohol you can try to put it away, but you can't cure it. If the school lets everyone hear their music and let them do what they all want it would be a disaster. Schools shouldn't let students hear any type of song that talks about either sex or alcohol, because is like telling the students that its fine to do it. That there is nothing wrong with doing those things. Since it is wrong doing those things thats why schools don't let students here that type of music on schools.     In some type of music like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, she talks bad about @CAPS3. That type of music is wrong, because one things is to hear music, and another that in a song they are talking about your religion. I believe we all respect all the religions and that no one should tell you things about your religion in a song. In this type of songs they even talk about the devil. That is somenthing you don't want to be hearing about.      Music can influence someone to do things they shouldn't do. School should not allow that type of music that promotes alcohol, because now in this days who doesn't drink alcohol. Students think its cool, and that people are going to like them more if they drink with them, or even if they have sex with alot of girls. That is what this type of music tells students that alcohol and sex are the best thing that you can do. But the only thing that matters is who you really are and not what other wants you to be. Students should focus on their future",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"When you go into a library what do you see? There are many people of all different kinds there. Everyone might like to read, listen, or watch different things. Taking some things off the shelves just because of their content isn't the right thing to do. There are many things you can do to make people aware of what they are about to get.     When you put a book, @CAPS1, or movie on a shelf, that doesn't neccesarily mean that everyone is going to get it. Many people have different taste. They like to view or read many different things. The library that I go to has many different sections for different types of books. That is one way to have people know what kinds of things they are getting.      Many people know exactly what they want. Most people wouldn't go looking for a book that would be offensive to them. If somebody picked up a book that had the possibility of being offensive, they probably wouldn't think much of it. They would probably be the kind of person not to get offended by it.     There are many things you can do to let people know that these books, movies, music, ect., have offensive content in them. One thing you can do is have a section for these kinds of books. Seperate them into the kinds of material the books might have.     Another thing you can do is right on the book or whatever it is your getting. Put that there might be some offensive material in here. If you you think you might get offended don't get it.      When you go to check out a book or movie, there is usually an overview of what it's about on the the back cover. Just by reading that, you can figure out if it would be offensive. If you think that you wouldn't like it, just put the book or movie down. It's not that big of a deal.     From my own experience I have come to find that some things have been kind of offensive. I don't usually get upset about it though because it was seperated into a section for more offensive books. By having them split up, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I got it.     I also see that many people don't find the things offensive. They know that it's just a story or movie and realize that it has nothing to do with them or their life. They usually get past the bad content in it and see the book or whatever they're getting for what it really is.     Taking books off the shelf is a pointless thing to do. There are many solutions to people who find them offensive. If they are split up into different sections or there's a warning on it, the people don't even have to get it. People have to decide for themselves if getting the book, music, movie, ect., is the right thing for them to do.",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"So their is alot of controversy about wither we should have more censorship on things. witch is a big deal if we do because then some of the things we like might be found to be offensive. so in that matter i have a few things that i would like to say about it and my thoughts towards the big decision.      To start off I would just like to say that their is nothing that offensive out their to where people have a problem with it. why take a look at it if you know it is going to offend you? the way i look at it is, it's a freedom of choice wither we want to read, see, or hear, about certain things. And no one is makeing you read it so why take it away from everybody? maybe someone wants to know about things but someone thought it was offensive so now they can't be educatied on that subject.      Next is the reason i feel how i do about this. witch is because people need to know things even if they offend someone else. for example some thing that offended me and doesnt offend someone else so i take it off the shelf but their is a book that i really like and it offends someone else then im not going to be able to look at that book anymore and if everyone does that then their will be nothing for us to learn or read about.      Last is my decision about this. My decision is that no, people should never be aloud to find something offensive and be able to take it away from someone else. its just not right and it takes away from everyone that doesnt find it offensive.      so to conclude this essay, their are alot of things out their that people read or listen to that they might take offensive but their should never be a way for someone to be able to take it away from the world witch is the main subject in this",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"I believe that people should not be allowed to pull books off the shelves of a library if they do not like the book. If they do not like the book or books they can just not read it. If enough people were to complain about the book or books, then maybe it should be considered, but I do not think anyone should be allowed to pull books off of a shelf in any library. And not just books, it could be anything such as books, music, movies, or magazines.     With music and movies, there can be offensive language for anyone. If it is offensive to you, I would suggest just not listening or watching it. But whatever the case is, nobody should be allowed to pull the movie or music off of shelves at a library, at any library. While certain songs or artists are offensive to some people, a lot of other people might like them. The same goes for movies, there are certain movies that some people just might not like, but then again if you don't like it, you don't have to watch it, or listen to it.      Then, with books and magazines, there can be just about anything anyone can find offensive in them. There could be anything from offensive language to inappropriate behavior. But, again if you don't like it, do not read it. In magazines, there can be inappropriate pictures, words, and other things. In books, there usually aren't pictures, but some of the words can be offensive to certain people. You never know what one person will say is inappropriate and what is not. I still think it is wrong to just take books or magazines off of shelves in a library, or any library.      If there is something someone, anyone, finds offensive in a library they can tell the librarian if they wish to, or they can tell someone else. They can even choose to do nothing about it, if they would like to do that instead. Or, they can simply just choose not to read, listen, or watch whatever it is they do not like. It is there choice, and nobody can make it for them, except for themselves. But, still, nobody should be allowed to take anything off of a shelf in a library, in any library. Even if something in a library is offensive to your religion or beliefs you can simply not read, watch or listen to it.      So, all in all, my point is that just because something is offensive to you that is in a library, any library, you should not be allowed to pull it off of a shelf. I believe that it is just wrong, and should not be allowed to happen. Even if it is against your religion or beliefs, I still believe it should not be allowed",3.0,4.0,6.0

But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor Then you also have exactly same right and so does evryone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., offensive?            We are all made different evryone have their likes and disslikes. Some like scarry movies or funny moves, maybe druma, and action. I like action movie I like the on that keep you gussing who and what. I would't like if someone removed my faverit type of movie or book from the shelf. Most parent want nothing bad for their kids so they keep tham away from the stuff that is not good for their mind.             @CAPS1 is a big place open for public to come and injoy the books  and magazines, or the movies and music. I been to the @CAPS1 befor my first time was amazing. I am not a big reader but there were so many choces. People go to the @CAPS1 to find information, injoy their favret authers and books. I one went to the @CAPS1 and asked for a book they said someone lost it that made me mad people dont dont take care of public proporty.            If someone doesnt like what they see on the shelf don't take it. But i thing the idea of having the books rated like they do the movies. @CAPS1 does a good job obout that they have A-@CAPS2 and saporated by different cotagorys. If you go to the @CAPS1 you usualy look for what you want not something you don't want. So if people take something they dont like of the shelf they must not like somone who is reading it or who writen it.           I believe that materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines that have offensive thing in tham it mite not be for some people. Like i said we all made different  we have our own like and disslikes. @CAPS1 is a big place that has something for evryone. If you don't like something dont take it.

If one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that it automatically has to be off the shelf. Maybe that movie or music you hate so much, is my favorite. If you dont watch or listen to it, that don't mean someone else doesn't.     Music that has curse words and about offensive things could be your favor type. Maybe you like slow love songs, or even rock and roll head banging songs. Everybody has there own personality. People everywhere listens to all types of music. Just because she don't like or he don't like it don't mean 'you' dont like it.     Some things should be put in a different section if its very offensive. I could understand movies and magazines because some can be epic i guess you can say. Maybe a little kid dont like clowns or the 'boogie man'. Other people do though. It should get put in a different section @CAPS1 removed completely.     Everybody likes different types of everything. Just because a movie is scary, or certain music is @CAPS1 your type, doesn't mean you remove it from the shelves. Put it in a different area that is all the same stuff.

2,"The media is a strong influence on society today. In fact, so much of what is delivered to the public comes with ratings or warnings before the program is even played. However, this process arises the question of whether or @CAPS1 our books should come with a 'Do @CAPS1 @CAPS2' label as well. The answer is no. Libraries should @CAPS1 be allowed to censor books because it is an unjust, opinionated, and insolent act.     To begin with, censoring one author's book as opposed to another's is a violation of equal rights. As part of the constitution states, citizens are allowed freedom of speech. This covers the idea of freely expressing one's opinions through writing. It is unjust for any library to remove an author's book based on what they have to say while leaving another's. The author whose publication is being censored has just as much right to voice his/her opinion as the next author. If a citizen does @CAPS1 agree with the author, the book should @CAPS1 be removed but simply passed over on the specific citizen's reading list. By removing any book on a shelf, libraries are taking away the legal right to freely express one's own viewpoint.     @CAPS1 only is removing library books from shelf unjust though, it is also an opinionated act. Every human being sees the world through their own eyes and judges it by their own experiences. Much of what authors write relate to their own life encounters or observations. Therefore, what one author writes about could relate to one reader while entirely offending another. However, this does @CAPS1 mean libraries should be allowed to remove it from the shelves. As the famous author @PERSON1 once said, '... if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no  books left on the shelf for any of us.' In other words, Paterson is saying that since opinions vary so greatly from one person to the next, then if libraries were allowed to pull every 'offensive' book off the shelf the library would be empty. This is because eveyone's opinions vary greatly and what one person might think is different than the next's. Therefore, libraries should @CAPS1 be able to censor books because it is a heavily opinionated act.     The last point that should be made is censoring libraries is inconsiderate to @CAPS1 only the author but the general public. When one removes a book from the shelf, he/she is preventing another from having the ability to @CAPS2 it. This gesture is @CAPS1 only then rude to the reader, but the author. In removing the author's book, one is degrading on the author's hard work put forth into creating the publication. The amount of time and effort put into publishing a book to then have it unseen to the public eye would be unheard of. @CAPS1 only this, but the public has just as much right to be able to @CAPS2 every book released to them as the author does to convey his/her's messages.. As a result, censoring in public libraries would be insolent to both readers and authors.     It should be made known though that many would argue about children and what these books expose them to. However, most libraries are categorized by age or matuirty level and then genre. Thus forth it is more so the parent's responsibilty to monitor where the child picks up a book from than the responsibilty of the library to censor it's selections. There is also the common argument of media influence. This influence is unavoidable though. In modern society, the media is everywhere and what one doesn't @CAPS2 in a book they are sure to come across on the internet, television, or even newspaper. Thus forth, to censor our libraries would mean having to censor other areas of media as well which again arises injustice and matter of opinion.     All in all, the point to be made is that there should @CAPS1 be censorship in libraries. Public opinion is a very controversial matter, but to pull the media further into it would be to ask for destruction. Censoring the freedom to express yourself is unjust and insolent. It also leads to the popular topic brought about in @PERSON2's @DATE1. If the public allows the government to censor our libraries, what will they truly start to censor from us?",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries have certain sections for books, movies, magazines, etc., Should there be a certain section for the censored or offensive subjects?     There are many topics and other subjects that can be offensive to people. Example, @CAPS1 of hitlers bibliographies, or a story of a dog that ends up getting hit by a truck. Some people might find it fine, & not offensive, where other people might find it very cruel or offensive. The way I see it is if it is offensive to you, dont pick it up & read it, or watch it. Let it sit there for someone interested in it to read or watch it. Another way to help libraries about this conflict, would to have a section for certian subjects, movies, magazines, etc. There are a lot of topics that people @MONTH1 find offensive or disrepectful, so why not have it in a certain area, And have people that dont get offended go there and if they want to know more about it or read more about it, then read it.      I dont believe that the libraries should remove them from the shelves, just have a designated area for them. I have seen little children watch movies that are a bloody mess. It isnt right, so have a certain place for them movies & books. Writers and @CAPS2 work hard on there movies or books. They shouldnt have there book or movies removed from shelves just because some people @MONTH1 find it offensive.      Yes, there should be a designated area for certain books or movies or any other thing people @MONTH1 find offensive, but they shouldnt be removed from all shelves.

2,"Censorship in Libraries      @CAPS1 are lots of books in libraries. They can't take all of them off of the shelf. If we do that then @CAPS1 will be nothing left. However I do agree with the statement that some books can be very offensive to some people. But others have very important pieces of history. Others might have important life lessons that we can learn from in them.     You can't take a book off the shelf just because it is offensive to one person. If someone finds a book inappropiate or offensive then they don't have to read it. Another thing is, they don't just put books in the library for no reason. Although some are pretty pointless, they still have their place in our libraries. Even if a book has some profanity in it. It is still in @CAPS1 for a reason. Because @CAPS1 is something to be learned from it.      I think that all books, music, and magazines should be left alone. As i said before if someone finds it offensive then they can just stay away from it. Because all of those things are here for a reason. For example music is here for our entertainment. some music that is good to one person might be completley offensive to another. It isn't fair to the person who likes that type of music that they would just stop selling it or playing it.      @PERSON1 make a very good point when she says 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'. she is saying that @CAPS1 is always going to be someone who finds a book offensive.

2,"Why Books @CAPS1't be @CAPS2     Books are meant to tell stories, or give information, or even just to state someone's opinion.There are many different types of books that people might find offensive sometimes, but that @CAPS1't be a reason to take books off shelves, and here are some reasons why.     First, if you begin taking books off shelfs then everyone will too. If a person doesn't agree with the author that is understandable, but that @CAPS1't give them the right to band the book. Everyone has a right to their own opinion, everyone has the right to be offended by something they don't agree with. Everyone has a right to read whatever they want.   Secondly, if libraries begin to censor books, then this will lead to stores censoring books, and then whatever we read will be controlled. If books are taken away or controlled, then people will become ignorant and unintelligent. Books are important because they give us the freedom to think for ourselves, and to make us believe.       Third,  books are meant to inspire people and tell people information that they didn't know. Books give people the oppurtunity to travel to unrealistic places and to take us out of a certain situation. Books show us different opinions and help us figure out how to do something. Books give us the ability to think and to understand.      In conclusion, books @CAPS1't be @CAPS2 at libraries. It takes away people's freedoms. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive to people, but not to all. Books are important nad people should remeber that",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Should you be denied the right to read any book that catches your intrest? What about denied the right to listen or watch the things that entertain you, all because someone with a different opinion views them as offensive? Well, in my opinion, I feel that if my choice of entertainment was removed from books, movies, magazines, etc., it would be as if they were taking away my right to freedom as well. If you don't already feel the same as me about this topic then I am determined to, at least, make you think twice about the examples I used to support my opinion.     For starters take the old saying '@CAPS1 man's garbage is another man's treasure.' and put it into retrospect with this. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what is acceptable and was is inappropriate. For example, when I was in elementary school, I remember a classmate of mine named @CAPS2. During this time we were reading the book, '@CAPS3 @PERSON1', which called for a permission slip to be signed by parents. Of course this book was most acceptable considering it was being read to @NUM1 graders but @CAPS2's mother denied the permission and @CAPS2 was made to sit out in the hall, while the rest of the class read this amazing book. My point here is that there will always be someone who doesn't agree or approve of something you @MONTH1.     The fear of inappropriate materials getting in the hands of children is becoming a big issue. This is not a big enough issue that we should rid everything that @MONTH1 be considered inappropriate, so that they aren't placed into the wrong hands, but an issue that brings upon another. As a parent/guardian of a child, you should set boundaries that have consequences if crossed and are well known by your child. If you think a series of books are inappropriate for your son/daughter then let it be known to them. Otherwise, authors are entitled to their right of speech and should continue to write and publish a story of choice.

Movies with cartoons to educational documentaries, as well as, books with pictures to books filled page to page with black lettering. A librarian wants to have different types of entertainment, so that it @MONTH1 bring all types of people from anywhere to enjoy. A librarian is also there to help assist you with your choice, if needed. @CAPS1 thing we should add to their job discription is making sure the right sort of entertainment leaves with the appropriate age requirements of the type of entertainment. As far as books or movies about racism to tales of the @CAPS6 go, I feel as if they should remain exactly where they can be found. Why keep such entertainment around? Do not dispose of them, they can serve for informational purposes and/or for some people whom enjoy hearing or reading about a tragedy. Either way, some topics considered offensive or inappropriate have happened in history or are still occuring today and need to be acknowledged not hidden.     Our right to speak freely, educational and entertainment purposes, and with the help of everyone, we can try and assure that unintended offense can be reduced greatly in the entertainment department.

2,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Should we be so pravoked as to deprive education from our children? Should we take the risk of making our future generations illeterate? Absolutley not! Well, this is exactically what happens when we remove what @MONTH1 seem to be an 'offensive' literary work from our shelves. This my fellow critics, is wrong.     I'm sure that every person can name at least one book, magazine, or song that @MONTH1 be considered 'wrong' or that displays a 'bad message'. I'm also sure that each person could come up with a book or magazine that they do not agree with as far as opinnion goes. Well, if every person went to their public library and demanded that a particular literary item be removed from the shelves, there would not be anything left for others to enjoy! Just because @PERSON1 the plummer finds a book is 'offensive' to him, does not necessarially mean that that book is 'offensive' to someone else.     Just imagine it. If every person in the world removed just one item from their public libraries and there was no material left, then what would our children do? They would have nothing to read or explore. Their minds would be as blank as the empty shelves in a bookstore. They would have nothing to help educate them. Reading a book, for instance, is a very important teaching method. It helps people and young adults to formulate opinions, relate to certain situations, develope ideas and an imagination (something very crutial to children). Just because a few people @MONTH1 not like a certain literary work, is no reason to have critics evaluate it's 'political correctness' and then remove it from our grasp.     Education is a very critical part of our growing society. Even the simple things, such as, books, magazines, and music are very richy-packed sources of knowledge. How will our youth survive if them have no means of education? How will future gerenations press on? The choice to be educated and have knowledge is the born right of every person on this planet @LOCATION1. Are you going to one who takes that away",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"The choice of whether or not to censor material available to children is debatable. By taking away books and magazines due to disgusting content, parents can prevent their children from being exposed to, and possibly following this type of behavior. However, this also means that anything found remotely questionable can also be taken away from children, including great @CAPS1 novels and nearly anything concerning @CAPS2. @CAPS3 these opposing views, there is one point to trump all others, and that is free will.     While the books, magazines, and music are made readily available, the children make the concious decision to take the offensive material. If a parent disproves of the children's decisions, they have the right to take the content away from them. However, they have no right to dictate what other children are allowed to do, which is essentially what the censoring of libraries becomes. By making the content unavailable, the parents are taking away the rights of the other people who wish to read the material.      A problem addressed in Katherine Paterson's quote is a good indicator of what could happen should the censoring of libraries be performed. 'Then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS3 being an exaggeration, the image of empty book shelves in a library serves as a good image of what @MONTH1 occur if libraries censored all offensive material. While others @MONTH1 not see a book as offensive, there will always be a critic who sees the book as rude. Therefore, after filtering the material at the library so that everyone is pleased, there will be no material left to enjoy.      While people have the right to take the book, they also have the right to leave the book. If they think the content is too rude, then they do not have to read the book. Thus, while the book is available to those who wish to read it, the book does not offend the people who do not want to read it. Therefore, if the person reads the book and is offended, it is their own squeamishness that has offended them, provoked by their choice to read this book. While they can warn others about this book, the book is free to go to anyone who would like to read it, which is the beauty of libraries",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Should some libraries censor their books and magazines because people think it is offensive. @CAPS1 if somebody goes into a library to look for a book they like and it is not there.     Although some people think that offensive books, magazines or movies should be taken off of shelves, I dont because @CAPS1 if a book somebody likes goes in there and cant find it, if you are doing a report about something and they cant find the article because somebody thought it was offensive so they took it off and some people dont think it is offensive @CAPS1 if everybody thinks that a book is offensive.     @CAPS1 if someone goes into the library to find a book they like a lot and they cant find it because somebody thought it was offensive. The person who was looking for the book cant read it now and enjoy a book that they would have really liked.     In school you have to do a lot of reports and you have to do a report about a book the teacher assigned you and you have to go to the library to get that book but you cant get because someone thought it was offensive. Now they cant do the report and they have to get a zero for it.     @CAPS1 if we can take books of the shelf and everyone takes one off. then we dont have any books on the shelf to read or watch a movie. Then how does our children get to read books. If they cant get books to read then they forget how to read.     That is why I believe that we should not censor books, magazines, music and movies.

2,I don't think that the movies books and other things should be removed from the shelves because at one time all of that was history. If you dont want to read the book or watch the movie then dont get it simple as that. Iit makes me mad when someone complaines about something just because they dont like well i got some thing to tell you get over it because theres a lot of things that people dont like and still have to deal with.     If theres a book on the history of black people and you dont like black peolpe then dont get it just because its there dosent mean you have to get it. Or if you think that there is something that shouldnt be said because it is wrong then dont go tell the media because that just causes more problems and makes a really big mess for every one and I don't like it when people make something small so much bigger because it not how they wanted it.     Music i only listen to one type because that what i like and i dont like listening to the other stuff that talks about smoking pot or what ever. Just because i dont smoke but for some one who does kudos to you they dont say any thing about my music I wont say any thing about yours and most of the time we listen to the music because we can relate to it I can tell you about a couple times I went out and had a fire and went around and did doughnuts in a field and some one else can tell you about when they were out getting high it all how you like it.     Movies i dont watch many except the ones that are about big trucks and what not things I like. And some people I no dont like that kind of stuff and would rather go watch some one get shot or ran over or die or some how not be ery happy.     So thats what i think about taking things off the shelces that people think are offensive just dont look at it and get on with your life not to hard to figure out,3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"When you walk into a libary you see all kinds of books and materials you can read and look at it, but is it all approciate? Some authors have different opinions on what they want to write about and say to the readers, some of their writing is not approciate to some kids under age.     I believe there should be a way only adults can read the higher book levels, and the kids under age should only have certain books they can use. Those big tough books look so cool but can a little kid read them? No, if they even tried to read them they wouldnt be able to pronounce all the words or get an idea what they mean.      Dont get me wrong, kids do learn when they read, but somethings in these higher book levels they dont need to know about quite yet. Some books out there just have a little bit to much information a little child shouldnt be learning yet in their age. Some movies and music are also the same way, you shouldnt have your child listening to a song about smoking or getting high, because you deffinatly dont want your kid to grow up acting like that. Show a good example to everyone else and be careful what you let your children listen to, read, or watch.     When I was a little kid, I read @CAPS1. @PERSON1 books and little bear books. @CAPS1. @PERSON1 books helped me out when I was a little kid, I learned so much from him. If your looking for a book to help your kids learn without you worrying about language and what they talk about, have them read @PERSON1, he rymes his words to make it more interesting for kids to learn.      Certain materials shouldnt be out in the open for little kids to see. If a adult takes a book of the shelf then the kid takes the book of the shelf too do they have the same right? Parents and adults know alot more then a child knows or experienced, so they have a right to read what they want, but a little child shouldnt be reading that kind of material when their young. When they grow up, they can have the right to read what they choose to. The safest choice is watch what you have your kids reading and watching so they dont learn something that their not suspose to",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines that have offensive language or visual content, should be unavailable to children.  Songs that have bad language, books and magazine that have bad images are all over the world today.  Some parent @MONTH1 not let their children watch movies with a certain rating.     I believe that if it was okay to be published than it should be okay for anyone to read or look at. It is okay for parents to not let their children watch a movie if they think it is bad.  If the parent doesn't care then I think the person doing it has that right.  If someone goes to the library and asks that a book be taken off the shelf because it is offensive, that doesn't mean that is offensive to someone else.  There are people who can put up with a little bit of bad language; other people @MONTH1 not like it at all.  Different people have different comfort levels when it comes to censorship.     Video games have many things that fall under censorship.  How much blood?  How much language?  If you have a game with a lot of blood and the parent doesn't like it, they can take it away from the kid.  They shouldn't be able to go to a store and make them take it off the shelf and not be able to sell it.  Other people might think that it is okay to have blood in a game.       Many songs today are advertised to teenagers.  Some have bad language.  A song is somebody elses work of art.  If they say that it shouldn't be allowed that isn't fair to the artist.  Many people, writing songs is their job.  If they aren't allowed to sell their songs, they won't be able to make money.     In movies there @MONTH1 be a seen that has sexual content in it, or maybe a scene at the bar with a lot of swearing.  In this case the movies put ratings on the package telling what is in the movie.  If a parent is worried about what their child is watching then they should look at the rating before letting them watch it.       Magazines have both images and language that can offend a person.  There are many different magazines that get sold around the world.  Some @MONTH1 have bad photos in them with a caption with bad language to go along.  If you don't want to see that then you have the right to not buy it.     In some television programs, they @MONTH1 make it blurry whenever something unexpected occurs.  I think that people should censor themselves rather than have someone else censor things for them",4.0,3.0,6.0
2,"Books, music, movies, magazines, and other items sometimes can be offensive. The individual who reads these items, I believe, will have to decided for themselves whether or not to keep them on the shelves. My veiwpoint is one that most of these items seem to portrait a message with a story, if the message is something that is right, contains a lesson, and has good morals, I believe it should stay on the shelves.      Some of these things that are opposed in today's world are books that contain history, like, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2'. We just finished reading this book in my @CAPS3 class. It did have some contraversial things contained in its pages, but, the history and things we needed to learn about, overcome the offensive parts of the book. This is an example of something that I believe to be ok to keep on the shelves, because it is a major part of our history.      If a book, song, movie, or magazine produced today held things that would extremely offend people, then yes, I woud believe that these things should be taken off the shelves. If an item was written just to cause a major upset amoung people, then I would not find it fitting for this item to be sold on the shelves.      After I say all of this, I do relize that things will offend people. Things have been produced that are contraversial and offensive to some. Even though this happens, I believe that we should be open to someone else's opinion on a matter, and not just our own",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I do believe that if a book is found that is offensive that it should be tooken off the shelves. I believe that they should come down because, it's inappropriate for kids under the age. Another reason why I think it should be tooken down because, their gaurdians would'nt want them reading stuff they aren't suppose to be reading, and I think people should respect that. I also think they should'nt be reading things like that because, they might come across something and the next day try to do it.   Some books, movies, magazines, etc., kids should not know about. Some talks about sex, killing, gangs, and guns. Kids might think its cool and run into some danger that @MONTH1 cause them to end up hurt or even worst, death. They should'nt be thinking about stuff like that.   Gaurdians send their kids to a libary to stay out of trouble, not go there to read about trouble. I dont think their parents would like it if they knew what their kids were reading. Other adults would'nt want their kids reading stuff their not suppose to, so they should look as other kids as if they were theirs. People should be more careful about what they sit books down at and were.   Kids walk down the street and see guys on the corner and see guns on t.v and think its cool. So when they see books about things like that their going to want to read it. They might pick up a book about sex on day and think its ok to do it because every body else is. Kids dont need to grow up to fast. That can lead to a serious illness like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and so on.   I do believe that stuff thats offensive should be tooken off the shelves. People should have more respect for kids and their parents. They should look out for kids like that because thats how gangs and crimes get started. I know people dont want to see their son out on the corner, or their daughter pregnant. Thats why I think things like that should get tooken off the shelves",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Library censorship    I do not think that the censorship of libararies is fair. The books in the library are there to be read, and the freedom of speach should protect that. I am going to explain my view below.     While there are several kinds of books that should not be allowed in libraries, who is to say that a book is offensive. The parents of children should instead of attempting to remove books from libraries; they should raise their children on better values.      Even if a book is banned, there are still people who are going to try and read the book. There have been several books that have been banned throughout the ages, and many people thought it was unfair and continued to read them. Eventually people figured out that it was unfair and they unbanned the book.     There was a time when I went to go to the main library branch of my town to check out a book on a touchy subject. I spent about three hours looking for anything on the subject and was unable to find anything. I eventually went up to the front help desk. I asked the man at the desk if he could help find the books I needed, but he told me the books had reciently been banned. I was frustrated and angered that I could not find any material on my subject and that I would have to pick a new topic.     I do not think that the censorship of libaraies is fair. The need to remove books could be avoid by teaching children better values. Even when people ban a book, there still are people who will try to get a hold of it and read it. I once needed to get a book for research on a touchy subject, only to find it was removed from the library",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Parents feel that allowing their child to roam throughout the vast rows of books and other materials in a public library is not a safe decision due to the obscene and condenscending themes portrayed in books, music, movies, and magazines. Many people have swayed opinions regarding the topic of censorship in libraries to restrict the material that many @MONTH1 find to be offensive. Censorship should be enforced amongst libraries across the country because of how easily children are influenced, the condenscending content that is portrayed throughout the pieces, and for the simple fact that the library is a public place that needs to remain appropriate and comfortable for all civilians.      Children are known to be easily impressioned by those who surround them. Parents want the best environment to place their child so they can grow up happy and healthy. Parents worry about their children, no matter the age. Children can be swayed by any information they discover and begin to want to live and act like that lifestyle they have learned about. These themes are most commonly found in the books they have read or in the songs they have heard. Books, music, magazines, and movies often times express terrible ideas because it is what the pubic demands to be entertained by. Allowing children to be introduced to these harsh themes is an obstruction to their youth. Knowing what is right from what is wrong and then basing decisions off of that statement is maturity. Kids do not fully understand what is wrong and right; therefore censorship must be enforced. Does society want the next generation of kids to grow up to become murderers or involved in gangs? Letting children grow up in a world based around the knowledge of negative influences is an irresponsible and unreasonable decision for the future of @LOCATION2's society and for the future of the child themself.     Condenscending content is the main problem with the materials that is found throughout libraries across the world. Books about gang violence, music degrading women, magazines spreading pornongraphy, and movies with murderers are not appropriate choices for the kids of the @LOCATION1 to focus their attention on. If children are allowed to read and listen to these sources, the @LOCATION1 is ultimately promoting the spread of violence for the next generation. Living in a dangerous community does not sound appealing for any human being. Embracing violence or derogitory actions for the children of @LOCATION2 is a mistake for what the future will hold.     The library is a quiet, reserved and public place that all citizens can turn to when in need to study or simply pass the time. Imagine the environment libraries would have when there is no censorship at all. If an old women sitting next to a teenager listening to a song that clearly suggests inappropriate or demeaning actions. The area that once was free for public peace and quiet would turn into a disasterous and uncomfortable place. People respect the rules and regulations of the library and would not like this area to be destroyed by harsh influences of the media.      All libraries should be forced to hold censorship among the offered media sources to ensure the quality of @LOCATION2. Having negative media influences throughout the community would be a downfall to society and cause uproars among civilians. Censorship should be pressed among libraries across the @LOCATION1 because of the easily impressionable children, the condenscending content that is displayed, and the meer fact that a library is a public place for all people, therefore it should remain appropriate and respectful towards to citizens who use it",4.0,4.0,7.0

If you dont want to be offinded by a book then dont read it, if you start to read it and get offinded then take it back and grap a new book to read instead of taking it off of the shelf so that no one can read it.     Some schools dont even let you get magazines and they dont get offinsive books and if they do the magazines are for sports, trucks, gossip, and skateboarding. Most of the books at schools are history books and adventure but some times they do get offinsive  to some people. If you believe that your child should not read a spacific kind of book then tell him or her that they are not aloud to read that book.     So in conclusion if you agree with Katherine Paterson when she said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' then you should try to get some books taken away but if you disagree with her then you dont care what your kids read and if you half way agree with her then try to name some books that your children cant read. I do not believe that some books should be taken off the shelf but I also believe that some books need to be taken off because they are old or they just dont get read but sometimes they need to be taken off because they are offinsive.",3.0,3.0,4.0

Even if the intentions of the writer re good the point they might be trying to get across @MONTH1 have a negative emotional impact on a reader.      There are thousands of books in libraries across the nation. Most books I've come to encounter that are morall insensative, are typically educational. Ones that try to teach you how to brush your teath, or make your bed. They are not always offensive context wise, but the images they portray @MONTH1 be racially insensative or stereotypical. Usually there is a young white mail with proper attire, and a young black male with baggy clothes and a backwards baseball cap. The message the authors and publishers are sending is that african americans are only familiar to urban culture, or even that white americans are subjected to suburban culture. Most authors would protest to this observation, but in the spongy mind of a child, they tend to pick up what they see no matter what the reason behind it.     Besides the racial issue, there are images, too explicit for children to see. Alot of childrens books these days are more violent freindly than they need to be. Pictures of severed limbs and violent acts. No child under the age of twelve should be able to look at images like that. It isn't settig a good example for kids in the regards of right and wrong. It teaches htem that doing things to hurt people is okay, and that hurting people is the right way to resolve problems. Alot of the crime children commit today isn't because of the access they have to weapons, but what they learn at a young age what they beleive is okay.          Language is the biggest problem in todays children books. Words like 'pissed' and 'damn' are used in alot of childrens books now-a-days. The result is more kids imitating what they read. Kids should not be walking around using that kind of language, but the books they read teach them its okay. Then their parents blame their friends or their teachers, which might be the problem in some cases, but the books aren,t always innocent.      Books in libraries should definateley be sensored due to their lack of sensitivity. Being sold in stores poses no problem, because the consumer has a right to purchase them, and the books should't have to be prohibited from the library. Just like a movie the book being checked out should be age appropriate for the reader. There is nothing wrong with telling someone they can't check out a book because it is not appropriate for someone of their age to be reading it",4.0,4.0,7.0

I believe if someone don't want to put in magazines or other things they have the right it take it off.      Above all, music and the other materials the world can see should be taken off the shelves of the world if it's not their lifes. There are some music that make funny of other humans, either size or color. If someone is offened to them they have a right to say to take it off. No one should make funny of other people by the way they look or are. Music have change to saying rude things to each other and how other poeple might not be good for nothing.     Also, magazines, those are they ones that make up the biggest lies of all. If they have no right to say lies or write something that someone has ask for. They also write about other people's life not someone that someone say will come out differnet in the magazines. There are a lot of humans that get dispponited with what they read and some do get offened.

In the end, music, movies, magazines, and books are not the same any more how they were in the @DATE1 they have change to wrost. Young child ate listen to music that shouldn't even listen to. Movies that shouldn't be shown to anybody that are out there in the world. If someone doesn't like that there is a story and shouldn't be out in the world that they should take if off the shelves.

2,"No, I believe that, every entertainment material should have a rating on it. Therefore you @MONTH1 approve or disapprove of it as a parent.      My first reason, why I do not think @CAPS1 should remove books, music, movies, ect. Is the reason that there is some people that are mature enough to read them and take them to an enjoyable note.      Most readers that beleive they are offensive, should simply put the book down and return it. Also if there was a rating on it for offensive material, alot of readers would not pick the book up, knowing it had offensive material on it.      Now, as a personal Experience. I remember a time when a kid waved a book in my face and told me to read a line. This is a little of how the sentence went. '@CAPS2 tried to get @CAPS3 in bed with him to have sex'. Now for a sixth grader those words are (bad words). So seeing them as a sixth grader you automatically have to try to show a peer the bad words you found in a book.     But, are those words exactly offensive? To some it @MONTH1 be but to others, it would be just another word in the book. Reading books and watching movies and all of that stuff, requires a maturity level. That is the reason why I think books should have ratings. Most movies have ratings on the box and if it is rated @CAPS4 you would not let your @NUM1 old kid watch it, so why would you let your @NUM1 old kid read about mental images he/her might incounter.     My point is that, If you pull of books or movies or music from the shelves. America would have a very dull variety of entertainment to choose from. So if you have a problem with the offensive material in a book or movie or music, ect., simply find a way to rate the material before you expose it to your childeren",3.0,3.0,4.0

I @CAPS1 never want my kid to pick up a book and see the way a racist man talks to a @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and think it is all right for them to treat others the way that man did. Most books have a meaning and show ways of life. While others show how cruel the world is by talking about rape, racism, religions, cultures, and people killing each other over nothing but a loaf of bread. I know if everyone could take a book off a shelf there @CAPS1 be no more books in the world. Our kids @CAPS1 never know the stories we know, the ones we have read, and they @CAPS1 @CAPS5 be getting the high reading level they need for their age. Every parent should first understand that apart of education is learning about history, (slavery, @NUM1, @NUM2..ect.) and @CAPS5 all of it is going to be as sweet as getting roses on your birthday. Some of it is going to be nasty and bloody, but something teachers and parents should really stress to their kid(s) is that is how the world @CAPS4. Today the world is no longer like that and treating others with disrespect is @CAPS5 going to be tollerated anymore.

There are some books out in the world I @CAPS1 rate @CAPS6, and I feel as if you should be mature enough and old enough to read those books. Books like '@CAPS7 @CAPS8' are great for anybody through ages @NUM4 to read, it should be rated @CAPS9 because of violence, and very few cursing. '@CAPS10', '@PERSON1', and 'The @CAPS11 @CAPS12' are all children books that could be rated @CAPS13, even @CAPS14-fiction books could be rated @CAPS13 if it suits the childs reading level.      One more solution could be to @CAPS5 even put books up that are racial, abusive to other countries, religions, and cultures on the book shelves of a public @ORGANIZATION1. That @CAPS1 surely solve the problem of our children reading them, and feeling that it is right for them to do the same things the people in the book did. If you want to read a book that has any of that inside of it, I feel that you should spend your own money and go buy it. When you are done you could return the book back to that place and get your money back if you wish, you can also donate the book to '@CAPS16' or, you can keep it for yourself.     The very final thing they could do to solve this problem is to have two seperate libraries, one for adults and the other for children and teens. The @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 could hold most of the books that have cursing, racism, and sbusive things. While the @CAPS18/Children @CAPS19 can have all of the other types of books, for them to read. If for some reason a book your @CAPS18 wants is inside of the @CAPS17 @ORGANIZATION1 and you allow them to get it, you @MONTH1 esscort them inside and be with them when they get the book they are wanting. When your child is old enough to drive is when they are old enough to enter the @ORGANIZATION1, as long as they have their I.D with them.      I never want my child to pick up a racial book a think it is okay to treat people wrong and with disrespect. That is why I feel these @CAPS1 be the best solutions to keep this from happening.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,I think that is alright the way we are right now. As we can read or listen to anything we want. It wouldnt be cool for someone to tell us the people what we cant read what we cant. I like how we can just read or listen to what ever we like.     Everyone likes how we have the freedom to read anything. The freedom to listen so anything too. I like to read books that talk bout the real real. Real as a whats going on around the world. I woulnt like someone to tell me i cant read that.     The truth is that we in the @LOCATION1. A place where theres freemdom. I just think i like the idea about we can ready or listen to anything we want.,2.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Should students, or anyone for that matter, be allowed to take offensive books, magazines, music, etc. of library shelves? No, students should not be allowed to take books off of shelves of libraries. If people took all the books off of the shelves that they thought were 'offensive', then there would not be any books left for the rest of the reading public.      However, there should be an age restriction as to when one can start reading or listening to that material. Take '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1', whose author still remains anonymous,for example. It was published right after the author, who kept it as a diary, died and was out on store shelves everywhere. That diary was written in the @DATE1's and was mainly discussing her drug addiction. At my school library, a student or faculty member must @CAPS2 to read the book due to the graphic and offensive @ORGANIZATION1 of the published diary. The book is simply left behind the counter, waiting for those students whom are mature enough to read it. If library faculty members get many colorful emails from parents portaining to the book that their child has just read, then they should take those books and set them behind a glass case.     Say that that librarian did @CAPS1 through all of the contents in the library just to satisfy everyone. Could one even satisfy the public by sorting through all of the books and removing the 'offensive' ones from the library? No, it simply could not be done. He or she would have completely wiped the library clean of all the books, magazine, movies, etc.. Is that really fair to the public that liked or loved some of those items? No. There are times where people are going to be offended by the @ORGANIZATION1 or content of the reading material. Why should one have to censor what they read or listen to just to satisfy others if the others do not have to read or listen to it? What happens if a student, that goes into the library every week, decides to reread a book that he or she has read several times before and he or she cannot find that book? He or she would not be able to reread that book due to the fact that someone did not like the content of the material. Again, is that really fair?      Now, say that that same librarian did remove all of the books that had offensive material in them. The regular flow of people coming in to check out books are going to be devastated to learn that a book they saw in the library just the other day was removed. The more the people are disappointed about the libraries, the more they are going to gossip. They are going to discuss how the library does not have any more books, music, etc.. They are going to tell all of their friends and relatives and people that they know to not @CAPS1 to the library. Soon, people would then start to visit the library less often until hardly anybody, if any at all, would visit the library. More and more people would resort to the @CAPS3 for research and books. The @CAPS3 is far more graphic then the library, in my opinion.     Everyone was born differently. People have different tastes in clothing, music, books, movies, etc. If there someone were wearing a certain type of clothing that I found offensive, would I @CAPS1 directly to that store and take it off of the clothes racks? The chances of that happening are slim to none. I simply have no right to take away something that belongs to the public just because it simply does not comply with my feelings and/or beliefs about the appearance of that peice of clothing. Now, if I read an incredibly offensive and graphic book, would I take it off of the shelves as well? Again, the chances of that happening are slim to none. Although, I probably would mention the selected book to the librarian and see if she he or she could put that somewhere for more mature readers.      I also think that if one does not like a certain genre that @MONTH1 be offensive, then that person should not read or listen to it. Just because that person thinks that that book or @CAPS5 is offensive, does not mean that the next person will find the book or @CAPS5 offensive. That person is not being forced to read it or listen to it. There is always going to be someone that @MONTH1 have different feelings that someone else. No two people are going to agree on everything or have the same opinion on something. It just simply goes against @ORGANIZATION1.     Honestly, I do not feel that books of graphic or offensive @ORGANIZATION1 should be removed from shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think, however, that they should at least have an age restriction or be placed where more mature readers can view them. People should all learn to respect one another and their opinions. All humans are created equal and people should just learn that opinions are normal in todays society. If that means that there are going to be offensive content in @CAPS7 libraries or any other country's library, then one should just have to learn to respect that. It takes all types of people and all types of opinions and views to make the world @CAPS1 round",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Millions of people live in this free land of the @ORGANIZATION1. The government has given society the freedom to choose what they believe in or against. Almost everyone who takes advantage of voicing their opinion has a different view on certain things. My view is that public libraries should not be censored.      Libraries are a specific place for discovery, growing, and learning new information. They are full of topics some people @MONTH1 not even know existed. Information available in a library @MONTH1 include religion, politics, views on popular conflicts, money, government, races, history, and other subjects. People willing to make an effort to find information that they need or just to learn something new will find whatever they need in a library that in uncensored. If certain topics in books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to just one person and that one person is allowed to remove it from their community's library, that is no longer available for anyone else wanting to know more about that topic. As the author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     As a high school student, I write numerous reports about many different things. I have to check out multiple books from libraries to collect all the information I need. If I need a reference about a certain religion, my first thought is to head to my school library and both of my community's libraries. If I go to one of the libraries and they are censored, I @MONTH1 not get what I need because just a select few people who found that material offensive took it off of the shelf. Religion is a very touchy topic, but many people @MONTH1 just want to engross themselves about the history or facts about a different one. As a @CAPS1 myself, I understand how important religion is. Although I am not close-minded, if a book about another religion offended my beliefs, I would understand the use of it to other people that @MONTH1 not believe the exact same as I do.      As you can see, I belive that censored libraries would cause more problems than resources that could be offensive. Public libraries are to provide the people in that community, now matter what their beliefs are, with information they @MONTH1 need.  Libraries are excellent places to search for information, and people's beliefs should not affect what is available there",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Censorship of certain reading material is put into place to ensure that no one is either offended or spoken ill of.  But by not allowing access to some of these books or articles, we are denied the right and privelage to grow in our knowledge of the @CAPS1 we live in.  This can change our descisions in life and even our thought process.       Most of the, 'resticted information,' we are denied access to are books or articles that discuss or refer to events or criseses around the @CAPS1 or here locally.  This includes the history of illegal transactions with other countries, detailed autobiographies that speak about the horrors of @CAPS2 and abuse, and even rejected ideas intended to help benefit our society.  Many institutes and organizations believe that these pieces of information are too graphic in their connent and, there by, wish to have them removed from publis access.  But what they fail to realize is that what makes theses books, articles, or reports so graphic in connent is what humanity need to gain equality.     The pupose of the these reading material is to instill or insight our society on how far we have come, and the long road we still have to take.  Take for example the tragic event that occured during @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  During the @CAPS2, a mass geneocide of the @CAPS4- @CAPS5 were murderd and forced to leave their home.  If some had not written their accounts or spoke out on the hardships they endured, we would have never known how cruel humanity can truely be.  It helped serve as a reminder that we can't allow something this severe to ever occur again.  By allowing the public to see this, we have benefiited as a society towards peace and equality",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Books, movies magazines and music are all things that we can find at a library. The question of 'Books being pulled of shelves' is a very appropriate question with everything that is happening now.     Some books are offensive some not, should the books that are offensive be pulled. I don't think so libraries should have a sytem that can monitor offensive subjects. The age of the person getting the book should be taken into consideration. They should make you be ina specific age group to be able to get some of the books,movies,magazines, and music out there.     Some of the magazines that our available @MONTH1 have @CAPS2 that isn't sutible for all age groups. But that doesn't meen they should be pulled it is up to the parents to monitor what kids read in magazines these days.     We all know that there are movies with offensive and @CAPS1 @CAPS2, but that is what the rating systems are for. That is why kind under thirteen can't rent a @NUM1 movie so that they won't be exposed to any @CAPS2 that the parents might not fing sutible for their child.     Music has a sign on the front of cd's that are not appropriate for all people. The sign says on it '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' showing that it is not for all veiwers. So with this warning sigh we should keep the music and not pull anything once again what the kids listen to falls into the responsibility of the parents.     Books are good, reading is good, and learning is good. we learn from the different variaties of literature in our libraies, so with that being said we shouldn't pull anything of the shelves because of its offensive nature.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Censorship in libraries wouldn't be a good idea, only because people have different outlooks and views on certain material. Books that are offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else. There are many different book genres such as fiction, non-fiction, drama, poetry, and many others. Some books are more for adults then for children, but if libraries got rid of adult books then they would have to get rid of children's books too because that wouldn't be fair to only have books for children. Libraries are seprated into different sections for a purpose if someone finds one genre offensive they can go to a different part of the library and look for material more sutable for them.     There are many factors that play a role in what people find offensive. Culture is one of the main factors that people could find offensive. Lets say that in @LOCATION3 you only have to be sixteen to drink alochol, but in the @LOCATION1 you have to be twenty-one. People in the @LOCATION2 would probably be offended if there child was to read a book saying 'Are you sixteen? If you are come to @LOCATION3 and you can drink whatever you want'. I'm sure no parent will send their child to @LOCATION3 after seeing a book like that,but in @LOCATION3 it wouldn't be a big deal to them because of the culture they have been raised in.     Language is another factor on what could be offensive to people. If there is music in the library for adults that have bad language, children shouldn't be able to check out that type of music out. Adults can listen to the music they want and it wouldn't be right if someone came in all of a sudden and told them they can't check that music anymore because of the language it uses. To some adults muisic with bad language in it would be offensive but to some it might not be.     Lessons or teachings could also be offensive to someone if they dont agree with what someone else has to offer. When kids learn how to tie their shoes they usually do it the way their parents taught them how to. When someone else tries to teach them a different way they don't even want to try it becuse they are used to tying their shoes the way their parent showed them. In books the author might say 'a apple a day keep the doctor away', someone people might agree with that saying some people @MONTH1 not. If you all of a sudden took material that people were learning out of libraries many people would get angry because you took what they believed in out and keep material that other people believed in.     Therefore I do not think that their should be censorship in libraries just for the simple fact that  people have different views on everything. Most people have the right to choose what they think is best for them , if they want to listen to music that uses bad language they are going to, if a book seems safe for a child to read the parent will let them read it even if it's not. Everyone has their own taste in what they believe in and this a free country people will read, write, or listen to what they want. If everyone was interest in the same material the world would be perfect , but today in this soicety the world will never be anything close to perfect.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries have a plethera of book in their collection. They also have movies, magazines, and sometimes newpapers. This is the general library, but what is really in the books? Should it be shown or given to a children that are six or seven?      Libraries today have books that contain, what today could be refered to as bad. They have pictures of naked women and men. In many cases this @MONTH1 be art work, but do you think that children won't have question's about it? Don't you think it could reflect a problem when possessed by hands of children, innocent children? Don't you think we should have seperate rooms or even buildings for the population that wants and is allowed to view this material.      The number and variety of movies libraries have in there possesion is growing. Libraries @MONTH1 have anything from a happy time @CAPS1 show to a movie such as the @CAPS2 that is a little less innocent. In many libraries today the only requirement for children to rent a movie is to have library card, then they can check out whatever they want. Shouldn't we have more barriers on what today's youth @MONTH1 see?      Magazines in the libraries today vary from children's magazines, to sports magazines, to magazines for womens clothing, and even advertisement for toys. Do parents really want to have to tell their kids about bras at age seven or younger? When does a parent wish to tell their kid 'no' on a 'really cool' toy they saw in the magazine down at the library. Shouldn't we have barriers on what children can see?      News, in many people's opinion, is nothing but bad news. Whether it be an earthquake in @LOCATION1 or a homicide in downtown, children can read about at the library. '@ORGANIZATION1' is what children could possibly read when they pick up the paper. Would you want to attend @ORGANIZATION1 after you heard of a fellow student being killed at @ORGANIZATION1? This can cause children to to have nightmares and not want to sleep or even leave the house.      Whether you are talking about books, magazines, or movies at the @ORGANIZATION1 libraries, your children can look at them. Wouldn't you, as a parent or adult prefer your children to be looking at age-appropriate, good news, than a horror book? As today's publications get more and more scary for children viewers,  wouldn't you like to know that your child is not reading about it and living his/her life like intended, as a child?

2,"Do you see offensive materials in your library? How does that make you feel? Most people do not like. They think that it should be taken off the shelf. I am one of those poeple.    A library is a public place . All ages ot people go there. That includes little kids. Little kids should not be around offensive things. The library should know that most of the poeple that do come into library are in their teens or younger.      Little kids pick up on everything , including words. If they see it they are more than likely to say it . I wouldnt want to a five year old going around saying bad words. Offenasive pictures are just as bad . They might see and go ask their parents what it means. After they told them they would probably tell their friends, this is the same for teens.      Teens tend to think that they are cool when the use bad words or see bad pictures. They think it is funny , and go and tell everone. Then everyone finds out and the library looks bad.     The library is a learning center and should consider the offensive things they have on there shelfs. They need to monitor the conent for all the eyes that can see it. Teens and younger kids come their to study or read books offensive things can become a destration.      So my point it that offensive materials should be removed from librarys. I think that most parents would agree with what I am saying . They are their kids and they should be aware of the offensive things they might be seeing",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"There are libraries all over the world. They hav been there for years and will be there forever. Libraries contain books, magazines, movies and music all available for anyone to pick up at any given time. The question is should that child, teenager or adult be picking that up? If a person has to ask themselves if they should pick something up or not then they probably shouldn't! That's usually a good general rule of thumb.     In my opinion, things that are considered offensive should not be removed from the library. Most libraries are open to the public, not just to the students. Therefore, things should not be removed, becasuse even though students shouldn't see them, adults still can. If there are that many problems, i believe that they should have different age sections with a librarian at each section checking to make sure that person is old enough to get into the section. This should solve all problems. If you truly find something so offensive then you should find a new library, just because it's offensive to you, doesn't mean it's offensive to someone else. Consideration is another key in this whole process. Be considerate of other people's thoughts. Don't be so narrow-minded when things come offensive to you. Just look past a book that's offensive and don't pick it up.      I've seen in libraries where students will see something that they don't think is 'right' and they will tell a librarian. This to me is a sign of immaturity. If you can't handle what you see then don't read the material! Every book in the library has a bit of factual information that will help someone learn, so don't ruin it for someone else.     Let's face the facts all books are in a library for a reason. Meaning every single piece of material in that library can be used and learned from in one way or another. In conclusion, look past anything that you don't want to see because ot can be a good learning source for someone else.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Everyone has their own taste in books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe that any of those materials should be removed from shelves due to their rating. The materials in libraries should be rated for different age groups, but not taken off shelves.  Some people like violent, scary, mysterious, or even historical books, music, movies, and magazines. If they are found offensive to someone, someone else does like them. People will always have their own view point.     If a library is getting told that some of their materials are found offensive to some customers then I do not believe that it should not be rented or sold. There are books that people find offensive, but they should just not check it out. Removing it from the library just because it is offensive to yourself is a little dramatic. If you are not reading, watching, or listening to it then it will not effect you. I beleive that people should be able to express their own life style even if others find it offensive.      Removing the materials in libraries that are found offensive would only cause a larger problem. After the materials are gone, the library will probably lose customers and have a chance of being shut down. Not only that, but people @MONTH1 protest against it if it was the books, movies, music, or magazines that they find interesting or cool. It would be best to just leave the materials where they are at and ignore the ignorance of others. People have the right to read, watch, or listen to any materials that they wish.     I know people that believe the offensive materials should be removed from shelves. My parents and grandparents both agree that that there are just some materials that should not be on display. My grandparents were mad when they made the @DATE1 movie. They think that it is offensive to some poeple that do not believe @DATE1 is really the end of earth. My grandparents are religous and they found it to be offensive to their religion. I believe that weither @DATE1 is real or not, it is just a movie for interest and nothing more. People blow things out of porportion and make things a bigger issue than it really is.     I can not make a big difference as far as making this point clear to others, but it just does not seem fair to me that others should lose the geners of materials that they enjoy due to people that find it offensive. Labaries should have the option of what materials they would like to sell or rent out to people as well.

2,"Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I would like to write this letter to you addressing censorship in libraries. I have heard a lot of things about how libraries should not be allowed to have certain books, magazines, music @CAPS2's, and other things that are not censored. I am writing this paper to give you my perspective on how this situation should be taken care of.      I have the right to believe that if it is legal to put something with, for example, curse words or negative images inside it then it is fine to have at a public library. If someone walks inside a library and sees or hears things they don't want to then they shouldn't have picked it up in the first place. Every person has the right to look freely at what they want but also have the right not to look at it. So if you have the intention of going to a library to buy a @CAPS2 that has curse words on it then it isn't a big deal. The best way to avoid situations with people complaining would be to have signs or flyers stating what sections of the library have these things in them. I can recal a time when I was at my local library and I was waiting in line to check out a book and there was an argument between the lady in front of me and the clerk checking out the book. As I listend I heard that the lady was talking about images that were in a book that she wanted to take home to read to her children. When she tried to explain what she was upset about the clerk simply looked at her and said that they have the right to have it in their library and if it offends her then she needs to just put it back. At that moment I realized that the clerk was exactly right and that is one of the main reasons that inspired me to write you this letter. Another thing I wanted to mention is that I have actually dont some research on this subject and found out that it is perfectly fine to have uncensored items in your library as long as it has been approved.     I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this letter and I hope it has helped convince you that it is okay to have whatever in your library as long as it is legal. I look forward to going to my local library again and realizing that, hopefully, I have helped support the problems with censorship that so many librarys have. Thank you again and I hope your job only gets easier.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Libraries today have a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines. Some of these materials are good and informational, while some of these materials just don't need to be in libraries. Libraries have anywhere from the bible, to bad magazines. I believe some materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offenseive because it would bring in more costumers, won't teach kids bad things, and make the town a better place.     First, it would bring in more costumers. If these libraries get rid of the offensive materials more people would want to come to the library. No costumer wants to come to a library that is filled with offensive material. People that go to libraries go there to get good books so they can enjoy reading. If they go to the library and have to deal with all the bad material just to fine one good book, they will find another library to attend. If a person sees the library is willing to get rid of some of there mareial to make the costumers happy, I believe more people will want to attend this library.     My second reason is, the offensive material won't teach kids bad things. Many books are just not appropriate for a teenage kid. Some books talk about sex or any other inappropriate topic, and if they read about that topic it just persuades the reader to try it. Also alot of music is not appropriate for kids. Many songs today have at least one swear word in each song. I don't think any parent wants there kids listening to a song with swear words in it. Many magazines we find today have inappropriate pictures in them. It is not uncommon to flip through a magazine and see a girl half naked. I think the inappropriate materials should be removed from the shelves to keep kids from seeing and hearing these bad things.     My last reason i believe the bad material should be removed from the shelves is it would make the town a better place. If books, magazines, music, and movies are not teaching these kids the bad things they would not learn these topics as young. I believe kids first learn about inappropriate stuff through a movie or they see a picture in a magazine. If these kids don't see or hear the offensive material as fast, it would make the town they live in a better place. I believe this is true because when I was a kid our library had magazines not appropriate, and music not appropriate. It was not hard for a young curious kid to go in the library and look at bad things. I believe that's why today so many kids have babies in high school, because they learn about that stuff when there young. Bad magazines and movies only persuade teenagers more to do them things.     I beleieve offensive material should be removed from the shelves because it would bring in more costumers, won't teach kids bad things, and it would make your town a better place. Libraries today have a wide variety of materials. They have anywhere from the bible to a bad magazine. Libraries need to be considerate of others, and get rid of the offensive material that doesn't need to be on there shevles. Even if that means the library will make @MONEY1 less a month, it will only make there town a better place to be",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"I belive books ,movies,music,magazines that are found offensive should be removed from the shelves. Books,movies, magazies are major part of your life. They help you study in shcool and they give you knowledge. But some of the books,movies,magazines and music we find in libraries can lead your child to a wrong path. These things can affect our daily life that you child lives in. My view to censorship in libraries are that the things that are found offensive in libraries should be taken of the sheleves so they don't affect your child.      The books that i find offensive and that i think can lead any child in to a wrong paths are books about violence,books about crimes and books drugs.They can affect your childs daily life that they live in. Some of the books that i have read in libraries have cruse word in them and the even talk about drugs. Movies nowdays show lots of bad things that a child should not see. The biggest thing i have seen in movie that i have found in libraries are nudidty and ses.They show things like sex, crimes, drugs, weapons. I think if a child sees these kind of things that can affect it views to other things in life.     Now lets talk about Magazines. Magazines show preety much the same things. They show us the things like sex and drugs and many other things that are not appropriate for your child and i thing its not appropriate for any child out there. You want your child to have good education. You wouldn't want your child to learn the things that you don't want them to. I have seen magzines in libraries that have things about sex and others stuff that won't be a suittable thing for a child.          Now lets talk about music. Music is a one thing that your child will listen to everyday. It will effect what he listens in the music and it can affect the behavior of the child and it can also lead your child into doing wrong things. Music includes profanity and many other words that you wouldn't want you kids to listen to. It also includes things about drugs and sex. Some of the music that i have listend from the libraries have taked about sex or many other things that you wouldn't want your child to listend to.          I think it is much needed for the libraries to take of book,movies,magazines,music that are found offensive. This can lead a child in to a worng path in thier lives. The books, movies,magazines,music should be educational in the libraries so they can learn the right thing and have a good life",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"The books being written, and are being read everyday are nothing like they use to seem. As times are changing, so are the context of the books. More sexual, and violent behavior takes place in them. Not many people see this as an offense to children, or teenagers but I personally do. The publisher should be put to the test, testing them on rather just making a few dollars, or damaging many individuals thoughts about life. How could this change? This could change by making tougher laws against the material being printed and what is being viewed by young vulnerable minds. More attention should be paid to the what are children are reading, watching, and observing.     There are books written by a certain author, where it is about teenagers sleeping with adults, and having sexual intercourse in public places. This is something that should be looked into no only by parents, but by administrators, and school board officials. A parent shouldn't have to become tiresome, and worrisome about what their child is learning. It is good that they know, but they shouldn't be scared that they are going to learn the wrong things or things they don't approve of. Everything that I learned in school wasn't like this, your parents knew because they cared, and they were informed of what was going on in their childs life. Materials with ratings above the adult level, should be only available to juniors, and seniors in  high school. No one under that grade level should become close to that level of reading material. Children in there freshman, and sophomore years are still in the immature stage and they don't know how to become young adults.     From my observance, and my own experience I believe that removing these books from the wrong eyes and minds would benefit everyone. This method could possibly reduce teen pregnacies, and reduce the under age sexual satisfactions young minds and bodies tend to crave. Young adults read these books but they that what they are reading maybe true, and some books are very graphic. Everybook that is written, is not for everyone to read and they aren't for passing around. There are times where adults @MONTH1 read these books to younger children, and then they become hooked and want to read more, and bring one of those books to reality. This is not a joke. Certain material observed by the human mind, can cause a problem. It can make you feel as if the book is about you, and the outcome of the book is the outcome of your situation.     All material isn't terrible material. Although certain material that includes sexual behaviors, and violence, and criminal mischief can cause harm to the persons everyday ability to function. They will look to the book as to how should I solve the problem, and will I get in trouble. The answer is yes you could get in trouble and yes you can be punished. Nothing, is worth losing a future over, especially a book that made money off of you. I read certain books because they depict the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 community and the surrounding that we live through every living, and breathing day. I am digusted at how some of those books speak about how @CAPS1 @CAPS2 women throw themselves at men (animals), for attention. I know this isn't true, and I wish that it would stop.     The harsh material printed is something that should raise many eyebrows, because it is something terrible to read and believe. I wouldn't want my children to become apart of that type of society. I believe it is garbage, that shouldn't be printed. Whether it is real, or fake, I still do not like it. I object the material that is out there, but I cannot stop the maddness alone. I would need all the help I can possibly get from any adult willing.",5.0,4.0,8.0

It won't have what books she wants because @PERSON2 is in charge of the library.      Suppose in that same library @PERSON2 doesn't like rap music, but @CAPS1 does. So, @PERSON2 removes any rap cd's from the library. Just because @PERSON2 doesn't like rap or books on animals @CAPS1 and @PERSON1 suffer the loss.     Now @PERSON2 has censored movies and magazines also. Which doesn' make @PERSON4 happy or @PERSON3. @PERSON3 wanted to read a nice magazine about all the gossip on the actors and actresses; and @PERSON4 wanted a scary movie to watch with his friends, but @PERSON2 hates scary movies and gossip magazines.

2,"What is considered offensive material? We all have read material that @MONTH1 have been offensive to some people but, that isn't a good enough reason to take books off of shelves. If we had taken books, movies, magazines, and music off the shelves because they were offensive to other people then what would we listen to or what would we read. At the off hand that a book is really offensive, why have it or get it in that matter.     The only reason that people take things like books, movies, and cd's offensively is because they were taught to take those things badly. As an example say that a indian boy goes into a book store and gets  book on how indians were treated in the past that affect them today, he would go home and read the book, the next day come back mad because of the things said or listed in the book. Well it couldn't be taken offensively because he or she should have asked or done a little prereading to see either what it would say or listed. Also things like music can't be taken down unless they have say a hateful message or hate because of race.     Many people nowadays use language that they dont think is offensive to other people but they do and they'll deny it so that it looks like they didn't say it but, that way they can uphold the image of looking like a good person and go on to voice their opinons  when they do the very same thing. But if people want these things taken off the shelves then they should have a good reason for it. Many books, movies, and cd's have been taken off shelves because they think this thing they're watching,  reading, or listening to is bad but most of the time the reason is because they don't take the time to understand or listen to what the book, or movie, and magazine are trying to say.           So next time when you pick up a book or cd and even a magazine or movie just remember try to either take the time to understand it or just skim through it to see if it's worth your time or not. But, please dont just take a book off the shelf just because you think it's offensive try to maybe ask for what the item is trying to opinonate to you or you could ask a person what some of the language means or what its trying to say.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, magazines, music, movies, ect., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?      I do not believe that you should have to remove these materials from the shelves of the library. But as a library and respecting people there should be an adult section of those books that are 'offensive.' If the problem has to do with cursing thats not too bad, but sexual content is not right to have in a library where there are children. As a child you are goin to see and hear things that are inappropriate everywhere you go there is no stopping that. But as a parent you should be censoring what your child is obtaining in their daily lives.     Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean everyone else will also. If there are books, magazines, movies, or music or maybe just something on the internet that has to do with cursing you should not get upset over it. Yes, they could have used different words to describe things but, they didn`t so that is something that people will have to deal with it. Reading curse words is no different then spaking them or even hearing them. Obviously the author wanted it like that, some people like things better if it does have cursing or other inappropriate material in them. That is how some authors make their money.     If materials in the library are full of sexual content yes, I do believe that the material should be removed from the shelves as asked from the citizen. Citizens should have some rights to what they do or do not want in the public library where there maybe young children. If the library feels they need to keep these materials then they should open an adult section only. That would keep everybody happy. The young children would not be in content with this material.     I have read a few books in the past that I was not happy with myself, it contained some very descripted sexual material in it. I got that book from our middle school library, that was very inappropriate I thought. Young adults ages @NUM1 should not be reading about that. I took it to the attenion of the librarian that this book was very descriptive of this content and she didn`t even know that this book was like that she was  concerned about how many middle schoolers had already read that book and did not tell her about it. She continued to apologize about how upset my mother had been.     Librarians should be aware of the material that is being destributed out from the library. They should be observing the books. When the books are returned they should ask what they did and did not like about the book. They should be curtious to the suggestions that people have about the censorship in the library.     Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves at the library. I have told you what I thought about the cursing and sexual content of the books in our libraries. I have given an example of a time when I had read a book that should have been censor proof first, and about the option to have an adult section at the library. That is my thought about the censorship in the libraries",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1:     Censorship comes in many varies. I believe that censorship is good to a certain extent. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from libraries because @CAPS2 take offense to them. I believe that there should be rules for the material, such as porngraphy.     In our local library, there are movies there that are rated @NUM1, should those be taking out because ten-year-old kids use the library? I do not believe so. Libraries should have rules stating that you have to be a certain age or have a parent there to say yes or no to get that certain material or not. In some libraries, they have graphic magazines, but you have to be a certain age to beable to see them.     If we, the @CAPS2, took books off the shelf because @CAPS2 took offense to them, then our book shelfs would be bare. Someone is always offened by something.     One thing, we as @CAPS1 censor out on television and as employes at a work place is saying '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.' @CAPS2 take offensive to '@ORGANIZATION2' because it has to do with @CAPS3 @CAPS4. When you are leaving a store around the @CAPS6, the workers there will say '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' not '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2.' As a religious person, I'm offened that @CAPS2 are offened by it. We have immagrates that come into the @LOCATION1 and try to change things because they are offened by it. I personally think if they do not like it, then go back to where you came from. Also on the radio, the radio stations do not play certain songs because the language the artist uses can offened someone. When someone gets offened by something that is said on the radio or television, they are always ready to sue someone for it. One thing I believe @CAPS2 forget is that we do have a freedom or speech, but it seems if you use it, they are going to get into trouble.     In conclusion, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be banned because @CAPS2 take offense to them. If you do not like what the author is putting out to the world to see, then do not look.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Libraries can be found almost anywhere in the @LOCATION1 and they can have some material not suitable for children. So I think there should be a censorship in libraries because children shouldn't see adult material in magazines and movies, children shouldn't hear curse words in music or movies, and children shouldn't see or hear rascist slurs.    Children should not be able to get movies or magazines that are rated @CAPS1 or have a parental advisory sticker on them from a library. Libraries should make that child have their parent come to the librarian and say that they don't mind their child watching or reading this material. They should also make the parent sign his or her signature to show they don't mind and show the librarian some I.D. just to make sure.     Children should not be able to get music if it has a parental advisory sticker on it. That music probably has explicit material in it like cursing and rascist slurs. The library should have his or her parent go to the librarian and say they don't mind their child having this and have them sign their signature and show some I.D. to make sure they are that child's parent.      So in conclusion libraries should have a censorship because children should not see adult material in magazines or movies, hear curse words in music or movies, or see or hear rascist slurs.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I strongly believe that @CAPS2 should not be censorship of books, movies, or magazines,etc. @CAPS2 has been many readings people do not feel is not something to have in @CAPS2 libraries. This is @CAPS1! Remember freedom of expression, and tolerance? People's words count and they have they right to express how they feel or think in literature, no matter how they express it in the writing or films.    Religion and belief systems are very hard to debate when it comes to censorship. For, example if @CAPS2 is a homosexual children's book in a library, a religious person might feel uncomfortable with this as he/or she might feel that this book is unacceptable to have in the library, though I believe tolerance is a big role in the solution. If, you do not feel that is not a readable for your children, this is also solved by sectioning. I understand it is something you might be do not agree with, but @CAPS2 are other people who do agree.     Now, when it comes to inappropriate things and children, they are magazines and movies that should be exposed to children's eyes. They are influenced by the media and everday things. I think this is an easy problem to solve by just putting the things that are 'adult material' in a section where kids are not allowed to go to.       Here is my main idea: @CAPS2 should be no censoring, but sorting. @CAPS2 should be more acceptance of readings for they have a reight to express @CAPS2 writinngs.

2,"I think that some books should be removed from the shelves, because some books have racism in them. racism books need to be removed from all shelves across the world. I also think books that are found offensive should be removed from shelves too.      I feel that most books should stay on the shelves. Most books don't even contain offensive writing in them. I also feel that the books with racism in them should be removed because those books will not grab a persons intrest. Most magizenes, however, are found offensive and they need to be removed.      I have not found a book, music, and movie offensive. I never once stood in a library and read a book that had offensive material in it. However, I have read a book that had racsim in it and i put the book as soon as the racism started. I feel that everyone has the right to remove the offensive and racist books from the shelves and it is our right to do it.      There are some pople that like offensive books, and feel strongly that they should not be removed from shelves. My argument twords that is if you ever read anything that was offensive twords your religion or ethnicity you would feel the same way as I do.  Some poeple might also say that those books have real quality information in them. Well they or you cand rewrite the book without using offensive or racism in it.     In conclusion books with racism in it should be removed from the shelves. Books that are found offensive should be removed from shelves too. I believe that those books that have racism in it are causing people not to read books. It is our right to remove racist books from the shelves weather you do it or not is up to you.

In the real world there are good things that happen, and there are bad things. Therefor the good and bad things that happen we cant controll. Most parents will try to keep there kids from looking at the offensive or negative things that happens in life but they cant. Children need to see offensive things in life so that they can learn from @CAPS1. They can eaither be like them, or choose not to be.     Little do the parents know is that you exsperiance alot of offensive things. And @CAPS1 does not just come from books, movies, or magazines. @CAPS1 comes from people.

2,"Have you ever taken the time out to think about offensive things that could be displayed in our own libraries? If you actually went out your way to notice some of the things showed you would probaly be shocked. Everything that is written, photo shot, or maybe in  movies are not always good. Some things are just left better unsaid rather than being out in the open.     First, everything that are in books aren't always true. Some people write fictional or even nonfictional books which mean they could be true or they be just an imagination. Most books are for older people which means it takes a little  more maturity than others. With that being said younger children that are advanced shouldnt be reading things that are for teenageers/adults. Some of those books should be tooken off the shelves.     Second, magazines arent always the best idea for younger people to look at. Most children like looking at photographs. Every picture in an magazine is not an appropriate picture. There are pictures in magazines such as models with half of their clothes on or even nude! That whouldnt be a pleasant image to display to ah child or minor. Things such as that should not be out everywhere.     Finally, movies are not always the best thing to look at from time to time. Some things in movies are just not appropriate at all. For example there are movies in which they display drug use, gang relation, and violence. Those type of scenes should never be displayed on a screen! Its very offensive on so many different levels the public shouldnt support such things. They should remove all wrong.     In conclusion, I have told you some of the items that I believe should be removed off the shelves at our personal libraries. Libraries shouldn't be a place where you come to see things that offends you. It should be ah place where you come to gain knowledge and learn new things. Just remember that every new discovery isn't always right.",4.0,3.0,6.0

But why protect me from reading it if it's on the shelf. Many people write books based on everyday life. Face the fact we are living in a world now days where children know too much as it is.

2,"Should there be censorship in libraries? This would have to be a mixed answer, with  a little bit of both sides. There are some things that shouldn't be in a library, while at the same time even if something is offensive is it truly offensive or is it just offensive to someone people? And is there another option to this complex equation?     There should not be censorship in libraries. Libraries are places where different types of information are collected and put out for everyone to learn from. But there should be a place to put offensive material so that if a person is offended by something it can go in a place that they won't have to look in.      What constitutes the term 'offensive'? Well offensive material is material that conflicts with someone moral guidelines. So with that in mind every item inside a library is offensive to at least one person. What if there was someone who found children's books offensive, would we have to remove all children's books from libraries?     But at the same time there are things that should not be on display for everyone to see. Not because they are offensive but are not suitable for everyone. Pornagraphy would be a prime example, it shouldn't be banned from libraries but just put somewhere where children can't get a hold of it.     So when the question of censorship in libraries comes up you have to take all of the different angles in to mind. One cannot simply remove something because it is offensive to some people, because that would be taking away the freedom of speech from the person who wrote it and you should never infringe upon someone's freedoms.",3.0,3.0,4.0

I believe that certain materials on the shelves at a library @MONTH1 not be appealing to everyone but you cannot just take everything off the shelves so your left with nothing.     I beleive that if someone comes into a library and wants books, movies, cds, or magazines removed just because they do not like it and do not have a good reason. Then that item should not be removed. If someone comes in and wants it removed for a particular reason that could be an exception. An exception to that rule would be if it hasd nudeity or extreme fowel language.      Another way that they could suit both people who do not want the item removed based on the ones who do is they could seperate the items with fowel language and nudity in to a seperate area or room. You could only enter that room if you were eighteen or older, if you had a signed note from a parent on file, or if you had a parent with you.      There are many reasones why I beleive the way I do. One of them is because of an experience I had. It was when I was about in eighth grade and they had an  @CAPS1 rated movie playing at a book store and kids came in the store. Somebody came in and thought i t was not right for little kids to have rated @CAPS1 movies playing in stores or librarys where kids are. So the person spoke up and due to the fact of her speaking up she got rated @CAPS1 movies removed from being played in that particular store.

2,"When in the library some people wonder through the rows scanning for a book that will attract their interests. However, some books @MONTH1 that @MONTH1 be displayed are inappropriate and unsastainable for anyone, even most adults. Society has become a custom to letting these types of books fill our shelves and letting the information stored inside educate our children of many nations. Although, as humans we should have the right to say no to this shouldn't we? Of course, that's why they should be taken off the shelves and bannded from public access.     First of all, children in our world have  become to well knowleged at such a young age. Who said that this information is needed for @CAPS1 to function? If society could look back into the past and discover that the children of that time were just as knowlegable as they are now then maybe they wouldn't publish as many horrible books for the younger generations.     Sit back and think for a moment, how many children have learned so much at an early age, and then become uninterested in learning as the reach school age? Too many, if we cut out all this inappropriate nonsense in early childhood our children would be smarter and more conscious about their actions and studies in their later years. These books displayed are far too common, and easily accesessed to young children, which is why they should be banned from all public libraries.     If a book is offensive to a child they @MONTH1 also loose interest in reading all together. This is also why many young people have given up reading and gone to movies and the internet. If these books could be taken off the shelves of the libraries the literacy rate would for sure, sky rocket and reach a boiling point. Reading cannot be let go, we have to come up with a way to inhance the reading in the school systems to better society.      In conclusion, reading such detailed information can scar a young childs mind for the rest of the years to come. This statement is indeed true, many kids these days have been sabotaged at an early age to learn what they do not want to. Although, this can be stopped, and should be stopped. Every person on this planet should contribute to make an effort to stop the publishing of these books published for young children. For this can only cause future grief and make a child someone different from whom they're supposed to be. Remember this, every child, cannot be a happy child, if they are learning information, that is not fit for their mind",3.0,4.0,6.0
2,"Do you beleive that some items in the libaraies are offensive, why? In my perspective, I think that books, music, movies, magzines, and other intertaining things should not be removed from the library because it might be useful to someone.          The most important thing that you should do is leave the books, or even a movie that might be offensive on the selves so that someone, like an adult or teenager could be able to find it. Some thing that might be offensive to a child, might be apporpiate for adults. People should be able to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. Parent of younger student should make a dicision of what there child should read.     So if you find some thing that is offensive to someone like a little kid, or even your son, or your daughter just take action and be a responsible parent. Do not like ur children check out books that are offensive. A child should not read teenage books like 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2' and even ' The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' because in theses storys  have violence and killing.     In @CAPS6, keep offensive things away from your children,but dont take it off the selves. People should be allowed  to choose what they want to read. It important because parent need to watch what there child watch, or even what they read.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"Taking books of the shelves just because they are offensive to some people? Absolutley not, i think that all books should be on the shelves for everyone to use even if some are offensive. If people who think that some books are offensive and think that the books should be removed from the shelves then they can pick diffrent books to read. They do not have to read the same books as everyone else.     For example if there is a book about drugs and how to use them and a strict parent would not like for there kid to be learning and reading about it then i reccomend to the library that they need to have a talk with the librarien or go check out and supervise them while they get a book that is acceptable. But as for the people who just dont think its appropriate for books that have drugs, sex, or violence in them then they just need to ignore it and let others read them if they would like to. Really where would are world be at if we had everyone take books off the shelves that they thought were offensive to them? We would honestly have nothing to read.     Some people think that drugs and violence are offensive and are wrong but also there are people who feel like religion should not be put in librarys too. We all have our own opinions about what we feel is right but i think that we should all be able to read and learn about whatever we would like in the public place.     Parents do need to be strict on there kids and watch what there learning about and listening to because it can have a bad effect in the future. You have the right to let your kid choose to what he/she wants to listen, read, or watch. So go with your child and check out a decent book that you approve of but leave those alone who would like to read a book or who would like to listen to a cd that they find enjoyable.       So no i do not think it is acceptable or should be allowed for people to take books of the shelves. Everyone should have to right to read what they would like to read. If you are at an age to make your own decisions about what you would like to learn about then you defiently should have the right to do so.",3.0,3.0,4.0
2,"I believe personally that books should not be bannded form schools and from @CAPS11. Every book has a cover with a story to tell, and when @CAPS11 pick up that book they see the story that is being told which sometimes can effect how they see things in life. Books gives @CAPS11 and readers different thoughts and views on life and on theirs as well. If I was a reader looking for something to cheer me up if there was never anything else important to do I would always read. before going to bed children would always ask for there mother or father to read them a bed time story before they went to bed because it would make them happy inside and would give them a story to think about while drifting off to sleep.     In my childhood books always played a major role in my house. Every morning I would wake up and my dad would always be sitting there at the table drinking coffee and reading the daily newspaper while my mom would sit on the other side reading some of her favorite books. At school I would sometimes go to the lirary and pick out a nice book to read like @PERSON1's @CAPS1 or The @CAPS2, and would read those books for a while until it was time for my next class. There are some books out there that tell the stories and the lives people had that would give us a better view of things that have happened in the past. If there are books that people dont like and want removed why not just never read that book if you dont like it.     If I was a little @CAPS6 looking for a book that dealt with the holocaust, and some one didn't like the book because it had to deal about @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 then why go and pick it up if you know your not going to like it. There are @CAPS11 and @CAPS13 out there like me that want to learn about the history so that we can better understand the past and the present. From reading books like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and other @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9 books I have learned that people died because one man that had the power to remove a race did not like them because of things he exspected they did. If you think about it people are removing books because the expect it has something that is unappropriate in its pages but you wont know until you pick it up and find out for yourself. There are books out there that do have unappropriate things but they also have a story to tell that can maybe explain why there is a unappropriate event that happened and that what was the cause.     I have read books that have showed me pictures of event that happened that led up to the ending. A example of a book would be @ORGANIZATION1 which revealed to me the things she had to do to survive the holocaust and the people and friends she lost that were closes to her. I understand that some people dont want their @CAPS11 to learn about the events that have taken plase and the history yet. Instead of removing the books from everyone to read why not put a tag or a sticker that has a age level from @CAPS10, to @CAPS11, then to @CAPS12 and finally @CAPS13. With this it would be a lot easier and finding the best way to solve this problem and would make everyone happy.     When I go to public library's I see @CAPS11 and @CAPS13 learning and having the joy to find out the history and events that took place. I would want every child and adult realize that through reading we can better understand the things life throws at us and the ways to handle these problems. I would want everyone to find a book that would tell a great story and would show them the things they want to see and hear about. every book @MONTH1 have a cover but under that cover it has a story to tell. With every story bring a new look at life.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Offensive @CAPS1     Have you ever misread something on a book or a magazine? This mistake happens among many people around our world. When people see some magazines or books and they're from a different country they might think that theyre thought bad of. While most people dont think of this and have no idea this is thought to be a common misunderstanding among our various people. I think that some @CAPS1 of books and movies should be censored if this will create this mood and misenterprets.     In this understanding since in various countries like @CAPS2 or @LOCATION1 they have very different beliefs and if they came to our country and seen what and how our reading and movie matierials are they will be appalled at what we love in our country. There might be a movie about how various leaders from @CAPS2 were killed and an @CAPS2 person will be extremely offended if they saw this and by this and start to hate out country as well as our people.     One day at the movie store I went with my brother and we seen a @CAPS5 woman looking at various books and movies around and she was very offended and emotional at the things she was seeing. So in most places things should be limited, but if an @CAPS6 wanted a movie they could just ask the store clerk for that certain title so people wouldnt be affected like this.     Everyone has different appeals against something they read or watch, it can be emotional, ethical or many other things. Another reason some things should be censored or removed from shelves are; if a child had wandered away from his mother and went to an different section of the library and seen an mature book and the title as well the child @MONTH1 get a different perspective like hey I should read this it looks interesting with a cool title, but not if its for mature audiences so most things should be most of the time tooken of the shelves.     Another reason is that you have to know what section of the library you're going to. Or you @MONTH1 get lost and end up seeing something you didn't want to. Another time I was at the library I went into the adult section with my sister and seen some very inapropriate @CAPS1 they were way higher up than teens and children books. Adults read more complex books with lots of emotions.      People everyday see books or movies and etc that they don't or would not like to see. The only proper solution is to take those things off the shelves. What can you do to help? You can always mention to the library owner that you've seen some things and you recommend them taking it off or just mention some suggestions. Only people can help this since if the other people from various countries  respect others and we want to respect their emotions and beliefs it's only natural to do this",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Have you ever found an interesing book that you have found offensive in any way? Does almost every book in your school library contain pages portraying to it? Everyone will find something offensive that you might not find it as that way. Some people might be more strong about it, while others, it doesn't bug them as much even.     There are many offensive things,such as bad language, rude comments, maybe racism made in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that people, in general, are not interested in viewing. This kind of media is found everywhere throughout the world. So there is no possible way to avoid all of it. Authors, directors, famous artists, and magazine writers have to keep making and writing new things to keep the fans enthused.     If someone has to read a certain book for a report at school, then they have to read what they don't want to.  Every school library has at least some books that students take home that parents aren't very happy in them bringing home. Younger kids might even bring a book home that has offensive language or participating in words talking about violence and that will have influence on them.     Not every bit of media is bad. It's good to have media because it keeps people entertained and something to view or listen to when they are bored. It is used everywhere and pretty much anything has to do with music, books, nagazines, etc.     Everywhere around you, at school, libraries, bookstores, maybe at home, there will be a book, movie, magazine, or music, you will find offensive in some way. Some people enjoy the way things sound, or what they view. Not everyone gets offended like others, but people have different views about things. Media is what keeps people going",3.0,3.0,4.0

That's most of the reasons of keeping these thanges.     There's a lot that me need about offensive thangs. Form telling are history to telling are colcher.

2,"Magazines, movies, music, and books that are found in the library @MONTH1 be offensive to some people and @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. Some parents @MONTH1 want to have their children learn about @CAPS1's at a younger age. While other parents @MONTH1 think the library should be shutdown for having more mature books on display for all of the public eyes to gaze down upon. Therefore, the argument about what is right and what is wrong to have on the public library shelfs occurs.     When my father and I go to the library the topic about what is right or what is wrong never occurs. @PERSON1 (my father) has respect for buisnesses, a public library being one of those buisnesses, and there judgement on what type of books to put out and what books not to put out on the shelves. @PERSON1 also knows that I have enough common sense to not ask for a more mature book, and go to a section of the library that I know i'll will find a book that suits my age and my level of maturity.     On the other hand, if I go to the library with my mother and theres even the slightest smell of a foul book she'll flip out. One time while my mother and I were going to the library to get books about the ocean and native animals to @LOCATION1. We happened to pass by a section of books that showed male and female body parts, and described how child birth occurs from mating to the actual birth. Thats when she yelled for the head librarian. When the head librarian got there my mother started yelling and fliping out to a never ending extent. Then started asking all these quetions about why the book was on the shelf, and why could the children be able to view those types of books. Eventually, I had my mother call my dad to come pick the two of us up and explain to him why we were leaving @NUM1 minutes earlier than planned.     Magazines, movies, music, and books that are found in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people and @MONTH1 not be offensive to other people. As in the above storys I told you about my father and my mother having different outlooks on whats in the library. My father knowing that I have the intelect to know what to grab and what not to grab. On the other hand my mother yelling about books that the library had there for informational purposes. So many people, even people that are married have different outlooks on what society should and shouldn't have on the shelfs at our libraries.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"It is my opinion that content in libraries should not be censored. If content in libraries is censored children are missing out on the timeless classics that have touched so many lives. Also, if books are censored, or taken out of the library altogether those books are now not there for anyone to enjoy. Plus there are already childrens sections in place in most libraries.     If content in libraries is censored the children would be missing out on the classics that touched our lives. Lets say the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' is removed from a library because of it's content. Now, that book has lasted through the years to be one of the most influential books of all time. It teaches us a story of a young girl growing up in a time were prejudice was normal, and the world was seen in black and white. That book, that has touched and inspired so many people is now gone and your children can't enjoy it. Would you want your children to miss out on a timeless classic?     If a library were to remove a book from there shelves, then no one can enjoy it. If taking a book off the library shelves saves a child from reading inappropriate content for their age level how does it affect older generations? A librarian might take a book off of the shelves because they believe it to be inappropriate for youg children. However the next person comes in in their mid @NUM1 to @NUM2 and might ask the librarian for help finding this book they want to check out. The librarian then tells the person that the particular book they are looking for is no longer there do to inappropriate content for children. The person then has to find a new book to read, perhaps not even get a book. Would you want everyone else to suffer on the chanc a child might get hold of an inappropriate book?     Putting aside all other relevant facts and information most libraries these days have childrens sections in them. A childrens section is designed to keep children in a reading area that is comfortable to them and to their parents. If a child is old enough to pick up a book outside of a childrens section, and understand its contents then that person should be penalized. A child that walks out of the childrens area picks up a book and reads it, but doesn't understand its content should not be penalized however. The child that walks out of the childrens section and can understand the book most likely has the sense they should not be reading that book. The child that leaves the childrens section picks up a book, and reads it without understanding doesn't know bettern however.     Content in libraries should not be censored. It takes away the meaning of timeless classics from the reader. If the books were to be taken out altogether than no one can enjoy reading it. Childrens sections in libraries are in place to protect small children from reading inappropriate books. If we as a nation continue to censor the books we have then one day we won't have any.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"Libraries have been open to the public for years, and are filled with vast arrays of media to help grow ones knowledge. There is a comfort in knowing that if one wanted to find a particular book or other material that they could simply go and check one out from the local library. But what if that freedom was stripped away? What if, due to censorship in libraries, one couldn't check whatever they wanted out? Censorship in libraries conflicts with the freedom of people and should not be applied.     One reason why censorship should not be used in libraries is that it limits the knowledge and understanding of a person. It is agreeable that certain material is unsuitable for some people, but if the person is just wanting to gain understanding about something it should be allowed of him or her. Everyone has a right to an education, and the library is a perfect place to gain one. But by using censorship it puts limits on what a person can or can't learn, which is wrong.     Secondly, censorship conflicts with the freedom of people in the problem that arises with it. What makes a book alright for the public and what makes it explicit? Everyone has different views about what is morally acceptable and unacceptable. For instance, if I thought one book or movie wasn't suitable for an audience but '@PERSON2' was alright, someone else might think what I thought was wrong was right and '@PERSON2 @CAPS1' wasn't. Just as Katherine Paterson was trying to convey to her readers, if everyone could censor whatever they thought wasn't suitable than there would be nothing left for anyone to read.      Another reason why censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that even implemented there, a person could still go and find whatever they are looking for at a bookstore or online. Just as in @LOCATION1's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4', where people were conditioned to hate books and weren't allowed to read anything like @ORGANIZATION1, there would still be exceptions. In @CAPS5 book, a man named @PERSON3 goes into this @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 having read @ORGANIZATION1 to the point where he has memorized it. In the same way, if individual books were not allowed they would still be around somewhere for a person to get ahold of.     In conclusion, censorship on materials at libraries is limiting to a persons freedom and should not be applied. Materials in libraries were made to be read and reviewed by an audience, not shut away where only a select few can do so. If someone wishes to read or listen to something, it should be their decison as to whether he or she should. Knowledge is something that should be sought after, something that should not have any limitations.",4.0,4.0,7.0
2,"A library is a place of information and wisdom. It is ment to help the person find what he or she is looking for. Even if the books are inapropriate and offensive it might serve someone elses needs.     Just because a book is offensive to the person doesnt mean they can't just put it down and walk away. They dont have to open or even look at it if it offends them.Taking that kind of material would only deminish the informational value of the library. You @MONTH1 as well take down the whole library because everything is offensive to someone somewhere.     As for movies and magazines, the same thing applies. just because its there doesn't mean you have to pick it up. I have read that even the most horrible information holds the most precious facts and information. It is meant to humor the writer and make them feel like they have accomplished something. It is a form of art that lets you express yourself in words and pictures without having to talk to someone.     Life isnt full of only good stuff and dreams. you cant just go around and censore everything that is bad. You just need to teach your kids not to read that kind of stuff. Teach them about the good and the bad because the world isnt all daisies and sunshine.     Our history hasn't been the most pleasent and unoffending so neither should our book, movies, or magazines.

2,"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music and magazines should not be removed from shelves if the are found offensive. I believe if you are offended by a book or other matrial you should not read or listen to it. If people removed all offensive materials from the shelves then what would be left on the shelves for the rest of us to read. Any materials put on the shelf for any of us should stay where it belongs.      Many times I hear people complaining about movies, books, and music and had them removed because it was 'offensive'. What if anyone had the right to remove 'offensive' materials from the shelves would there be anything left for the rest of us. Libraries should not stunt the growth of the shelf stock. Censorship is important but not as important as the knowlege of the children and if censorship blocks the truth then how will the children learn.      Censorship however is important for the fact it keeps the minds of the children clean and uncorrupted. If censorship was not applied what would happen to @CAPS1 youth. Would children think violence is ok or would they know better? Would the minds of the children be ok if there was no censorship or does it matter?     If censorship was not applied the knowledge of the world would be limitless regardless of your age. As the years come and go it appears that censorship in libraries is growing stronger not by removing the books, movies, and music but by making offensive materials less available for younger people.

2,"There should not be censorship in libraries because everyone has their own opinon on what should be censored or what should not be censored or what is offensive and what is not offensive. Censorship is bias, personal, and unreasonable. Everyone should have the right to read or watch anything they wish too.     Censorship is bias because a group of people or individuals @MONTH1 think that a certain book or movie is good while another group of people think it is horrible. It varies from person to person just like their favorite flavor of ice cream.     Censorship is personal, everyone has their favorite genre or author but that does not mean that only one's favorite authors should be accepted while other authors be banned because one as an individual does not think that genre or author is worthy enough. Some authors @MONTH1 connect deeply with some people and not at all with some others.     Censorship is unreasonable because not everyone will agree to ban a certain book or movie or to not ban it. They will all have different opinions and view points on why it should or should not be banned. No one can say for sure that this is right or this is wrong. Who is right and who is wrong? More importantly, who will decide?     If anything should be banned from libraries it should be censorship itself. Censorship is bias, personal, and unreasonable. It just doesn't make any sense to censor one author, book, or genre and not any other. I very much agree what the quote by Katherine Paterson is trying to say. If all of us ban one thing then nothing will be left unbanned. Every human being is entitled to their own opinions and no one should try to take away something that has meaning for someone else",3.0,3.0,4.0

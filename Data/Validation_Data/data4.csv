4,"Moving from place to place, even in the same country, is a difficult thing to do. Saeng has moved away from everything she;s ever know, and she is very sad. The winter hibiscus gives her a new hope in her new home that things will get better and that she will be able to adapt. The author finishes the story with saeng’s vow to re-take the test in the spring to emphasize her new home. The author uses three things in saeng’s vow that are very important and show how saeng is adapting. Saeng vows that she will take the test again “when the snows melt”. Saeng is relating time to her new and old homes. She also says that she will take the test again when “the geese return “. This shows her relating time to her new @CAPS1 home. She finally relates time to her old home when she says she will take the test when “thishibiscus is budding.” @CAPS2 three events express saeng’s thinking as to where she lives. She lists the hibiscus last because it reminds her of her old home and is most important to her. The author put this vow last so as to express saeng’s determination. ",3.0,10.0

4,"I believe that the author included the last paragraph because it shows Saeng’s realization and understanding. I believe that Saeng realized that between the birds and the plants, she felt like she knew it. The text states, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition season upon season, almost, familiar to her now.” I believe the author used the geese to show this realization because they are creatures of repetition, and it showed her that she needed to build up her strength and keep trying.

4,"The author concludes the story with Saeng’s particular thought to put emphasis on the hibiscus’s meaning to Saeng. Along with other things, the hibiscus reminds Saeng of her old homeland. It provides comfort for her and helps her relive old memories when she was back home. She has been  having trouble adjusting to her new life and the hibiscus acts as a motivational tool. Moving can be a difficult process, especially when it’s to a foreign country. So you can imagine Saeng not being completely focused. With her new discovery, she can adjust easier and possibly pass the test this time knowing the comfort she has recently found with a simple plant. The author’s purpose for closing the story in the way that he did was to emphasize the feeling of comfort when you are far from home and how it can come in the strangest places.",3.0,10.0

To add on to things she had just failed her driving test, which was just another blow to her current state of mind. It was just a really rough time for her when she found and bought the hibiscus plant which brought back memories that she had been missing. The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to show that with a little help from her family and a little bit of support from the small piece of her old culture that she bought ad planted, she found new strength. “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus.

4,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus” concluded the story in the way she did to show hope and progress. When Saeng came to this new country she desperately missed her homeland. It seemed that her only comfort was her memories and the flowers helped to embody these recollections. Saeng’s mention of taking the test when the hibiscus buds, implies that she will need time, like the flower to adapt and bud, but she shows hope for progress in pomising this to herself. Saeng’s past is weighing on her shouldrs and it is her burden like the snow burdens the flower. So when she say, “When the snows melt…” She means that when she accepts her past and her burden is lifted, she will take the test and progress onward. These last words are saturated with the hope the new flower gives Saeng and her dreams of progress begin to unfurl.  ",2.0,7.0

She fails her driving test, getting her even more sad and it seems as nothing can get her happy. She then buys a hybiscus @CAPS1 reminding her of home. It smelled like her grandmother, who she loved. The @CAPS1 gave her peace at a time when she needed it. At the end she showed courage saying, “I will take that test again”, and is becoming a more confident, happy, forgiving indivual.

Next, Saeng will take the drivers test when she is ready which she says will be next year when “ this hibiscus is budding” this means that Saeng will be “budding” just like the hibiscus, because the hibiscuss gives her strength. Saeng is also becoming more comfortable in her surroundings, because in the text it says that “she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. This shows that she now realizes that she has no excuse now for her actions because everything has become normal to her now, without her even realizing it herself, just like the geese which has now become normal to her.

In the story Saeng came home with a plant that she had payed with all the money she had, her mother stated “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” @CAPS1 she had disappointed her mother by trying to please her made Saeng want to do something to make her mom happy.

In the last paragraph, it states “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take my test again.” This shows that she is determined to pass her driving test, which she failed the first time.

It reminds her of many memories, and also gives her strength. Thinking of her homeland makes her “break down and weep” but it also gives her the drive to push forward. She spent over nineteen dollars on the plant so her and her mother could plant it in their own garden. Being reminded of her homeland makes Saeng realize that things do change and she has to learn to adapt. The hibiscus tree represents the grow Saeng will go through.

4,The author ended the story like this because it shows the determination of Saeng to complete until she passes it.

The hibiscus is almost like her good luck charm without the hibscus she feels she will fail the test. Because it is some what like a piece of home to her.  ,2.0,7.0
4,I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One reason is that the test means so much to Saeng in so many different ways. It represents how hard it is for her to adjust to the new life. It also represents how much she wants to pass the test just to prove that she isn’t having a hard time with her life. Another reason is that the author wants the reader to know the Saeng isn’t going to give up. The author wants to show readers to never give up to matter how hard and hopeless it seems.

To be specific, the authors theme was survival and adapting to new surrounding, by ending with the narrator vowing to try again in the spring It shows the narrators will to survive in a new area/home. The author @MONTH1 have also ended this way for symbolic purposes. Forexample, having the girl promise to try the test again “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is bidding “ has the hibiscus symbolizing not only the literal sense of beauty but the idea of cormfort, strength, determination and survival. The author also has the change of season from winter to spring symbolizing not just the change of time but also as symbolic for the author’s ability to adapt to her new surrounding/home because her family has moved to the @CAPS1 from Vietnam and she is missing home very much. Fastly, the author could have ended the story like this to create a final mood, @ORGANIZATION1, when one reads the final sentence they get the feeling of determination, power, strength, drive etc. therefore the after effect or feelings they have are strong and fresh causing it easier for the reader to understand the theme and symbolism in the story “Winter Hibiscus”",3.0,10.0

4,"The conclusion to “Winter Hibiscus” is very clever. There are many reasons why the author chose that ending. First of all, you can tell that this story is about Saeng and what the flower represents to her. She sees a bit of determination in the flower. At the end, she is determined to take the test next year. This connection is deliberate on the part of the author. Another reason why this ending was chosen is that “the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, it will be spring. Spring is the time of her new beginnings and it fits well that Saeng should retake the test at this time. She is vowing to have a “new” chance in the “new” year. In winter, everything is dormant, including Saeng “determination”. When spring comes, “it will all come out. Ending with this paragraph also reflects on the changes in Saeng when she buys the flower.

Then when Saeng’s mother saw that she was crying @CAPS1 she felt bad. When her mother said lets plant this the hibiscus was dead or not blooming. When she looked up she saw geese flying away. Then she said, “when spring comes I will take that test again.” The hibiscus is symbolizing @CAPS2 chances, or @CAPS2 beginnings. Saeng said when the hibiscus gets another shot at life, she can get another chance to pass the drivers test. This is why I think the author finished at the story like that.     ",2.0,7.0
4,The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is determined to pass the test and things of home will help her. Saeng misses her home and can’t even get enough strength to say she misses it. I feel the reason why saeng failed her test was because she missed her home to much to concentrate. Saeng was very emotionally and attached to her home and feels she can’t do anything without it. That’s why the author concluded the story with that paragraph. The geese and the hibiscus remind saeng of Vietnam and will help her to suceed. She went into the plant store and bought the hibiscus to give her a more homely feeling so she can start to call @LOCATION2 her home. Once spring comes around saeng will have plenty of time to adjust to @LOCATION2. With the geese and the hibiscus around saeng will feel home and should be able to pass her test.

By ending the story like this the author shows how Saeng is completing her own cycles. She tried the test but failed so she will try again. Flowers such as the hibiscus, bud in spring & die in winter only to bud again when spring returns. The author mentions this in the last paragraph as another cycle.

Since she failed the test it must have been difficult for her. “strange” like the potted hibiscus. So, as the seasons have changed circumstances before. She will wait for spring to come and the hibiscus to try to change her relationship with the driver’s test.

They decided to plant the flower and as Saeng was digging the soil. Cananda geese flew over in the sky. A reader can infer that they were leaving for warmer weather.

Her second chance would be when the geese return.,3.0,10.0

She realizes near the end that even the geese have become familiar to her, so when all the familiar things return like the hibiscus and the geese, she will be able to take the driver’s test again which is unfamiliar to her. During the story, she is sadden by memories of familiar plants, she starts to realize that her new country is not as strange anymore and even the things that she found strange in the beginning are gaining some familiarity. She has to adapt tochanges that can be extremely hard for anyone and the things that she finds familiar to her are helping her through it. The last paragraph has a lot of feeling as it is when Saeng seems to be filled with hope and determination which is different from the sadness and longing of the rest of the story.

Saeng has just failed a test and is afraid of her mother’s reaction. The test is what has her upset throughout the story. However, in the last paragraph, Saeng looks at the flower and realizes that she can rely on it to comfort her. This is why she says that when the hibiscus is budding, she can take the test.

In the story, the author writes, “But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?” Saeng misses her old country and her grandmother. Because she misses these two precious items, she spends the extra money to buy the hibiscus plant. So she can look at the plant and have those fond memories of fixing the grandmother’s hair. Possibly, she could have been thinking of these grievances while taking the test. By having that hibiscus plant bud in the end, the author is showing how Saeng knows that everything is going to be okay. All good stories must end with a conflict resolution. By ending the story with the chosen paragraph, the author is solving the conflict of the test and the memories.

For example “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair. As you can tell from that small quote. You can see that the smell of the flower brings her back into the past where she felt warm, comfortable, and the times she spent with her grandmother in a familiar place she reconizes. Another example would be, “Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand new, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight.” In the quote Saeng holds on tight to try to feel something that will remind her of home.

The geese come back in the spring and start over with their lies. The hibiscus will bloom and start over and live. Saeng will start fresh by ridding herself of the feeling of failure, When she takes the test again she will not feel the way. The hibiscus will start its life with new petals and beauty. Saeng will also be trying again. After her first failure, she has not given up or passing the driving test. The geese have not given up migrating and the hibiscus will not give up blooming.

Therefor her past experiences will not allow here to give up. She has put so much into trying to become american that she cannot let this one bump in the roud stop her. Another reason is that the @CAPS1 of the story is perserverence. The author had to finish the @CAPS1 and tie up the last lose strand. Since the background stories were perserverence, they had to tie the main story line into the them. The last paragraph allows him to do that. Lastly the hibiscus symbolizes perserverence. Not only can it last through harsh winters, but it connects Saeng to her past and allows her to see where she has come from in order to more clearly see where she is going.

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.” The memories of her home were so intense that Saeng has a difficult time letting go and moving on. But the flower helped her change, it helped he to go on and accept her new home. The hibiscus helped her start again and to not give up even if she failed the test she would try again. That's why the author ended the story by saying when a new season, starts ,so will Saeng's life she'll start a new beginning in her home in the @LOCATION1.

4,"In story ""Winter Hibiscus"" I think that the author concludes the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" @CAPS1 likely because maybe in the story Saeng feels that maybe when this flower grows back it will give her good luck or maybe the author is just showing how tough Saeng is and wont give up on something even if she didn't succeed the first time. And also, how once the geese and that flower where strangers to her and how they weren't maybe that's how she feels about the test it was once strange to her then the second time it wasn't.

Another reason for this paragraph could be that it shows how nature affected Saeng. Once geese flew over her she vowed silently to herself. This means they are the ones that inspired her to make vowe in the first place. Before the paragraph it says, “she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky” (@NUM1).

While doing so she noticed a flower that was available back in her country, and so she purchases this in order to give to her dissappointing mother a flower of her native country. Although this is not directly stated in the reading It becomes obivious. And is also somewhat proven as it lifts the burden on her mother, because when she found out she failed th test she became almosl furious, “For a long moment @PERSON1 said thing in her mother reached out and and said ‘it’s a beautiful plant’! From this the readers can see that the mother was dissapointed, but hid it in her because of the flower. But @CAPS2/ reason she wanted to retake is also strongly shown in the second to past paragraph where she sees the geese comes to a conclusion, “ she reilized that many of the things she had thought strang, thoug quite repitition of season, had become similar...” this showed vowed she had to repeatedly take the test until sucesesful.",3.0,10.0
4,The author in the paragraph that she cant wait untail the snow melts and the grass turn back green so she test if the plants will grow scince their is a building near the place were they grow there plants. Saeng wants to test and see if the plants grow. Support from the text that supports this is the conclusion paragraph.,0.0,0.0
4,"The author concludes the story with that line because the hibiscus flower represents her grandmother and the life she left @CAPS1. In doing so, once the @CAPS2 flower @CAPS3 in the spring, Saeng will feel ready for the test gain, as if her grandmother were there again. This is why the Author concluded the novel in such a way.",1.0,3.0
4,The author ended the story like that because she has to take a test on agiculture. I guess he wanted to seem like she goes to school. Most of the story talks about the plant named the hibiscus. So he wanted she goes to school instead of home. That is why the author done that.  ,1.0,3.0
4,"The author concludes the story saying “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show that she will try to adjust to change in life. Adjusting to changes in life is the theme of the story. It shows that adjusting takes time and you have to want to adjust. When Saeng first feels she failed the test her mother helps her understand that it is ok to mess up sometimes long as you always try and fix it next time. Even when you seem out of place try to wait till things comfortable for you “When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding” shows that you should start trying to adapt to circumstances when they become good for you and you can “take that test again”. Trying to adjust by making things now you remember is good.    ",3.0,10.0
4,"Saeng thinks of the hibiscus flower as being her connection to her old home, and she finds that comforting. The Winter Hibiscus and other plants “drew her back into her childhood world” (Ho, I), With fresh memories to comfort her, she copes with the move from different countries better. Saeng sees the Hibiscus as being like herself, and in @LOCATION1 “Its flower aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here that’s what matters” (@NUM1). Both the plant and Saeng belong back in Vietnam, and they are not as natural in @LOCATION1, but they can deal since Saeng finds so many similarities between herself and the plant, she thinks if the hibiscus can live and adapt to @LOCATION1, so can she she sees the spring as being a time for rebirth and now life, just like the flower and plant to start it by passing her drivers test.",2.0,7.0

4,"The author might have included this to show that the plant will never be fully lost, yes in winter it @MONTH1 die but when spring comes around it will be back. It will never be lost just like her grand mother. This is why I think the author made this the ending to the story",1.0,3.0
4,"The author concludes with this paragraph because she is using the metaphor that things will begin again, and there is hope. Saeng has moved to the United States from Vietnam. She misses her homeland. One thing she remembers in the hibiscus plant. When she failed her driving test, she felt as though she’d never belong. When she is on her way home, she sees the hibiscus. She goes to the flower shop to see if they have the plant she knows as “@CAPS1.” She finds the hibiscus, that has adopled to the cold weather here and made a realization. She can adopt just like the hibiscus, and become suited to her new country. The last paragraph is Saeng promising herself that she will do better. She is promising to adopt, like the winter hibiscus.",2.0,7.0
4,The author included this paragraph at the end of the story for many different reasons. Major reason is to help get the purpose across. For instance “winter hibiscus” is about overcoming obsticles. The story would not have been as well writen with out this paragraph because the much character will have jist sulhed and felt bad for herself. But with this paragraph it shows how she just that herself off and plan to try again. Also this paragraph shows the main character hopes of passing that test because she is going to try again. Without this paragraph much of the message would be lost.,2.0,7.0
4,"The after concludes the story saying, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself , in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think she concludes with this statement to tell us that next time she’ll do a better job planting the hibiscus. She probably didn't think she did so calld so now she wants to try again. She probably said that to encourage herself to do better job next time. This is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.",1.0,3.0
4,"The author concludes with the paragraph, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” to show and/or represent new life in a way. The hibiscus plant symbolizing new life and opportunity for Saeng. Throughouti the story, the hibiscus represents her ability to overcome obstacles and comfort in a time of disappointment. With that, I am to believe that when the hibiscus plant comes back and opens up, Saeng has the confidence and comfort to take the test again. Therefore, the author ends with that paragraph to represent Saeng’s new opportunity and confidence in taking the test.",2.0,7.0
4,"The author ends the story like this because she wants the story to end with the plant having more significance, the author wants the plant to hold a purpose even after the story finishes.",0.0,0.0
4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects to the whole story to bring everything together. For example, it connects to the hibiscus that Saeng buys after failing her drivers test. @CAPS1, it connects to the geese. For example, “Like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.” @CAPS1, it relates to her driving test because she failed it. The author is able to combine all of the elements in the story, to pull everything together. @CAPS1, the meaning of the last paragraph is that by the time the geese come back she will be ready for the test and ultimately, she will be ok with living in @LOCATION1.",1.0,3.0
4,The author concludes the story with this paragraph to keep the reader guesting on whats happening next. He did it that way so he didn’t tell them what happen at the end and they want more so he had the readers thirsting for more.,1.0,3.0
4,She sees it as overcoming as the plant strugles and then seeds in spring showing new life and new canchnis so dos she fined new hope in spring to try agine to get a license.,1.0,3.0
4,"I think that the Author concludes the story as the author did to create wonder. The small end paragraph signifies that Saeng's story isnt over. The written story it self is but her dream remains. It shows that she hasnt given up and will take the test again. I also think that the author put the last paragraph in the story to give hope to the reader. Showing that Saeng isn't over, that She will not and never give up.",2.0,7.0
4,"I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because her tone sounds like it would be in spring because usually the snow will melt, geese would return, and the flowers bloom. I think she would want to take the test in that certain day because it is much more easier to take the test in the spring than in winter and also spring represents happiness, hope, joy, relaxing, and more of a good feeling than in winter. This is why I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.",1.0,3.0
4,"The author ends the story with the quote ""When they came back, saeng vowed silence to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because she wants to see if what happened this spring happens again next spring. The geese will fly back to the same hibiscus and do what they did this spring. The author wanted to let reader know that the birds will come back and @PERSON1 will do her test all over again.",1.0,3.0
4,"The author ends the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again” to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, “Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.” This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, “And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too”. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.  ",3.0,10.0
4,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph ending in “ then I will take  that test  again “ for a few reasons the author concludes the story  with  that  paragraph  is because Saeng had not yet adapted to  her new home so she said she would take that test again. The test memory she had been comfortable and adapted to her home .In paragraph is it say’s  “  A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it story Saeng  eyes  now  swept  over  her  head,” This quote show that she has not yet adapted to her knew Home and still  strangly missed  her old  home .That is why she states m the last paragraph that she will have to take the test again.”",2.0,7.0
4,"“When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to portray symbolism. In the story, the flower represents innocence and growth. Saeng had just come over to the country for Vietnam, and she was still trying to adapt to her new environment, while trying to do this, she ran into obstacles. One in particular includes taking a driving test. However, snow melting, flowers blooming, and geese returning symbolizes a new beginning. Once all of that happens, then Saeng will be able to start over and retake the test.",2.0,7.0
4,"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the snow is gone, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding it will feel like home to her. Saeng is from Vietnam, which is a tropical climate. The cold winter months in the United States would seem very alien to her. In the spring everything would get warmer and it will remind Saeng of home. Saeng has grown used to the geese. The geese are “almost familiar to her now.” This shows she is adjusting to her new home and incorporate the geese into that. When the hibiscus grows buds for its flowers that would truly remind her of home and comfort her. That is when Saeng will be able to pass the test. The author ends the story this way to show that her new home will comfort her too and she will be alright.",3.0,10.0
4,When Saeng came back she vowed silently to herself because she was having a hardtime.She did not get done what she wanted to have done .She did not pass her test .She said “I will take that test again . Nobody in her class like the bitter melon not even the teacher .They planted a seed in the hard ground with a rusty frame.,1.0,3.0
4,"The reason for the author placing said paragraph as a conclusion to the story was to show how, much like a flower returns to beauty and life in the spring, Saeng will try to do the same with the sorrow of leaving her homeland. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says that “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” In the paragraph before this statement Saeng is reminissing on past events through the flowers. Then in paragraph @NUM2 Saeng begins to cry, because she misses everything she left behind in her homeland. This was the “test” the Author spoke of. The test of trying to cope with leaving everything she knew. So when she says “when the snows melt and the geese return, and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The Author is saying that she will ""bud"" again just as flower returns in spring.",3.0,10.0
4,"I think that the author concludes the story with the paragraph he did, to let you know how Saeng felt. Saeng vowed that when spring comes again and the hibiscus is budding she will take her driving test again. Saeng was very discouraged that she didn’t pass the test. This hibiscus plant gave her hope though. In the story Saeng is so upset until she sees that plant and it reminds her of her home. The author shows that the plant is slowly making Saeng feel better. The author puts that last paragraph in to let you know that Saeng feels better about the whole situation, that when spring comes she is going to start over by taking her test again.",2.0,7.0
4,"The author says this because the girl will only do what she has when the hibiscus come back out because that’s when she knows best. In this story the girl and her mother seem to be very close, and her mother tends to always be working in the garden. This plant makes the girl happy. One day her and her mother had planted hot peppers and bitter melons. But one day she took it to school and no one liked it, it was a cultivated taste. This girl had grown up eating this kind of food grown directly in her back yard and to her she preferred to a big Mac. So in that reason she added that at the end to show your family side, and what different things they do and like.",2.0,7.0
4,"The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show emotion. For example the tone of the paragraph shows that Saeng is determined to take the test again and that she wants to do the right thing and pass. Also it shows that she is willing to try again instead of giving up which is a strong characteristics. Finally it also leaves the read wanting to know more, like if she passes or fails on her second attempt. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.  ",1.0,3.0

4,"In ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, she ends the story in a very meaningful way. To Saeng the Hibiscus flower is more than pure beauty. To her, it is a constant reminder of her homeland. Now that it has gone to Winter, and the flower has died she is unable to bare with the sorrow of leaving her homeland, since the constant reminder is gone, she was unable to pass her test since her @CAPS1 has gone so Minfong Ho ended the story with ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She will regain her @CAPS1 and will pass her test. She ends it this way to show how the hisbiscus is more than its pure beauty.",2.0,7.0

4,"Failur, disapointment, @CAPS1 – all are reasons why the author ended the story with that paragraph. First is failur. I thought Saeng felt like she faild her mother. I think this because Saeng spent over ninteen dollars on seed for her vegteable garden. Another reason is disapointment. I think Saeng was a disapointment to her mom because they don’t have a lot of money and she spent ninteen dollars on seed. Also because she bought her mother a potted plant that cost a lot. Finaly it would probably be @CAPS1. I think Saeng felt shameful because her mother yelled at her for spending so much money. In conclusion this is why I think the author ended the story with that paragraph.",2.0,7.0

She missed her old home and was haunted by memories of her past. In order for her to live her life, she realizes that she has to combine the two worlds which is shown through the winter hibiscus. It is the flower of her past but is different in some aspects such as it’s deep rooted appearance. At the end of the story she comes to terms and accepts, this idea which is why the author included the paragraph at the end of the story, as a way of showing determination.  ",2.0,7.0
4,As told in the story this plant (Hibiscus) gives her a sense of comfort. It’s her only connection to home. Saeng is homesick. It is difficult to move from the place which you call home.

Seeing this plant brought back so many memories to her and her mother. To other people it @MONTH1 just be a plant but to her and her mother it means so much more. By taking her test in spring when the plants are blooming will give her that sense of comfort and help her adapt to changes.,2.0,7.0

She misses what she used to see every day and things she got to do everyday. The test that she failed was hard for her but when she sees this flower it reminds her of old times. The author puts this in to conclude the story because Saeng will see the flower budding and try that test again. To saeng the flower represents confidence, determination and hope to never give up.",1.0,3.0
4,I think the story was ended that way because she found out her mom understood and they were ok so she wasn’t as warried so she decided when it bloomed she would take her test again.Her mom saw tear stains on her face and her puffy eyes and that’s when she started to understand.,1.0,3.0
4,"In the last paragraph of the story “ Winter  Hibiscus,” by Minfong  Ho, the author is concluding that Saeng needed some time to herself before she decided to take the drivers test again. Saeng was still very upset that she was in a new place and had just failed her driving   test. She saw a plant that she used to have at her , home in Vietnam. It brought back old memories to her and she began to cry. When Saeng   said, “in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,” she realized that everything was new to her in the United States. She needed time to adjust and become focused on the changes that occured. It seems as if when the hibiscus plant starts to bloom, Saeng  will bloom also and become accepting  to do more. Therefore, the hibiscus plant is very important and has a lot of meaning to Saeng.",3.0,10.0
4,"The author concluded the story with the sentence, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again.” This suggests that even though the writer has stopped writing, the story is not over; it allows the reader to imagine the outcome of Saeng. Also, it adds a hopeful and determined tone to the end of writing. In the story Saeng feels out of place in the United States and misses her homeland, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” She looks to the familiar plants, hibiscus, “Dok Malik,” and “Madagascar periwinkle” for comfort, but it doesn’t keep her from breaking down and weeping. The conclusion to the author’s story suggests that perhaps when the cold, harsh, barrin season of winter has ended, she can start fresh and a new, just like the buds in spring. Saeng might have a chance to fit in here in her new home; Saeng can be hopeful.  ",3.0,10.0

The last paragraph of the story reads, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” The author concludes the story with that paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng has not given up on her new life, she just needs a little more time to adjust until she becomes more comfortable.

Both have to overcome their obstades. The line also has many other meanings.

Then she says when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test,” because the hibiscus is comforting and familiar as well. When all of the stress is gone it will be easier for her to take her test and pass. Comfort is important to all people in a stressful situation. By ending the story on this note it shows Saeng’s strength like the hibiscus in winter. Her mother says, “I’ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.” Just like the hibiscus, Saeng @MONTH1 be out of place in her current location but she has the determination to survive in a place out of her comfort.

4,"In “Winter Hibiscus”, the authors concluding sentence is used to convey a certain message. This is a message of both hope and acceptance, and it shows how Saeng moves on from her sadness.

She not only hopes to accept @CAPS1 as her new home, but she hopes to pass the drivers test in the spring. She says that the hibiscus is almost familiar to her now. Another reason is to convey a message of acceptance. Saeng has accepted she is nolonger in Vietnam, and she was to shaky to say the words at home”.

4,"The author of “Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the quote “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” To show what the plant symbolizes to Saeng. The plant symbolizes hope and memories for Saeng. So in the story when she saw the plants she wanted one because they had plants like that back where she used to live. A quote would be “As Saeng walks home after failing her drivers test. She sees a familiar plant.” I think the author also concludes the quote into the paragraph because it is a sense of hope for Saeng. The reason I think this is because in the quote it says she will take her driving test again once the Hibiscus come back in the spring. This means that she will have more confidence in herself and feel more at home in the spring to take the driving test again. So therefore the Hibiscus symbolizes alot to Saeng and thats why the author uses that quote to conclude the story.",2.0,7.0

Also, the paragraph shows ideas coming from nature Saeng decided she would pass the test in a time based off when the birds would be back. Throughout the text, nature put ideas in Saeng’s mind. At one point, the plants in the store recalled a memory of hers from her homeland of putting a similar flower in her grandmother’s hair continuously through the text.

The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam, where she formerly lived. When it buds, it will mean that she has become more mature and acclimatized to the United States, that she has found beauty and ability to adjust to changes in her life.

The first of a few themes I had gotten from the ending said something along the lines of, having to move away from the hard work pass and start new again. This represents two things that happened in the story. The flower has to go through a possible harsh winter, representing the past in when Saeng lived in Vietnam and her failing the driving test. However when that spring time comes around and the flower survives full of new life it gives new hope, as to how Saeng moved to the united states and how she is going to take the drivers test. It is a tough journey, but to survive it shows new great door to open and start again being stronger than before by letting go of the journey, sense it is now behind you.
